       Air Landing Fee: New South Wales
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.

       The draft Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities and the draft Agreement to be entered into between the Proprietors of Nursing Homes and their Residents which have been tabled in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia by the Honourable Peter Staples, Minister for Housing and Aged Care on 18 September 1990.

       2. To ensure that the Agreement can be offered to Residents of Nursing Homes without offending the conscience of Proprietors and Staff who have moral objections to the grant to any person of a right to indulge in extramarital sexual intercourse in their Nursing Homes.

      <para>
       3. To eliminate vague and uncertain language.

I am asking the Minister whether it is a fact that a reading of the recommendations by Janet Strickland will indicate that material on the new opt-in service will be far more degrading of women than material that is currently the subject of public outcry.

         â€”Obviously the Minister has not read the recommendations. I ask him why not. The recommendations show on pages 7 and 8 that there will be a binding philosophy which will bind the committee that is established by Telecom. Janet Strickland described the philosophy-it used to be called a principle; she now calls it a philosophy-by saying that adults should have the maximum freedom to impart and receive information and ideas and children should not be exposed to messages which are harmful to them and that the public at large should be protected from advertising which, inter alia, is misleading, false or grossly offensive.

        When it comes to the question of who sets the standards, there is established a seven-member committee. But that seven-member committee will be bound, as per page 12 of the recommendations, to give expression to the philosophy contained in recommendation 2. As I have mentioned, recommendation 2 establishes a philosophy that adults be free to choose what they view.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said last night, that is a specious argument. Adults are not free to hear any anti-female propaganda of the porn merchants unless it is published. The real issue is whether the Federal Government should permit Telecom to act in effect as a publisher of this material for the `sexploiters'. That is the question that I want to go to.

         â€”No. If I could be permitted to express an opinion, that is not the case. I am saying that Senator Harradine should look at the words. I am perfectly comfortable with Janet Strickland's recommendation 2. It happens to be very largely my view, as opposed to the honourable senator's, about the proper role for Telecom to play in monitoring what happens on its telephone lines. I want to ensure that people are not under any misapprehensions about this. One would think from listening to this debate that the Discovery service was set up for people to go to the extraordinary trouble of getting a personal computer and paying a subscription fee, a service fee, purely for the purpose of exchanging sexual conversation, which seems to be a rather complicated way of doing it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Discovery is nothing of the sort. I have no doubt personally that the people who would use this extremely useful service would do so to access the mass of information which is available about advertising and promotion, accommodation, travel, computer courses, banking and finance and, indeed, gambling and gaming services. I know that Senator Harradine has a close personal interest in the racing industry. I think he is probably a net loser, like most people associated with that industry. I think he owns the leg of a horse-or the tail or an ear. I do not like gambling, I confess. I have an antipathy towards it. I have seen enough at first hand of the damage it does to people. But I would not suggest for a minute that Telecom should monitor what goes on on its telephone lines in respect of the Discovery service on gaming. I would not want Telecom to remove that service, as distasteful as I find it, because I do not think that is Telecom's function.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recommendation 2 refers to the maximum access. It does not say-and Senator Harradine and I, and a number of other senators, have been over this debate at length before-and I am not silly enough to suggest that we live in a world where everything is black and white and where there is no censorship. I have never taken that position and Senator Harradine knows it. It is purely a question of judgment about where to draw the line.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, some years ago the Government decided that it would not allow bestiality or child pornography to be portrayed in the X-rated videos now sold in Australia. So Senator Harradine is perfectly correct that it is simply not true to say that there is no censorship or, indeed, that I or the Government supports a position that there should be no censorship. I do not take that purist view, but in accordance with these recommendations-I say again to Senator Harradine-the seven person committee will determine finally the standards that are acceptable or not acceptable, no doubt mindful of these recommendations which have been accepted. But the recommendations are not binding; they are to be used as a guide. That is the precise answer to Senator Harradine's question. I imagine that at the time when the Committee makes the determination and publishes its guidelines Senator Harradine will have an opportunity to canvass whether or not he agrees with those guidelines.

        It is believed that an `opt-in' system for `adult' Telephone Information Service messages would allay public concerns about ready access of `adult' material to children; would give the customer more control over the services which he/she wishes to have delivered; would restore the quality of existing OO55 services; and would give adults a wider choice of services, as well as a greater freedom of expression.

         â€”I am again at a total loss to understand why Senator Harradine would immediately leap to the conclusion that a desire to provide adults with a wider choice of services would automatically result in something degrading to women. I am just astonished by that leap into space. The answer to the question again is that no absolute determination can be made from what I consider to be a very sensible statement. I believe the opt-in approach to this service is the desirable way to go. I happen to support this particular recommendation. I hope that it is adopted by the Committee.

       <para>
        There is some sort of impression created that there is an on-screen X-rated video service available through this Discovery service; that is simply not correct. The kind of free expression that Janet Strickland is talking about is only in respect of the one-to-one communication which electronic mail provides. Again, I happen to be a great advocate of electronic mail. It makes maximum use of the advantages that computers can offer to people; it is on a one-to-one basis. The only people who receive it are the people who want to receive it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The electronic mail service that operates through Discovery where people can send on a one-to-one basis to mailboxes-the numbers of which are only given to people who want the mail-is exactly the same as if I bought a People magazine, or wherever the adult mature media group advertise, took a telephone number from that magazine, rang John Lark's enterprise in Canberra and ordered a video tape over that service. Alternatively, if I was desperate to do it-and I am not at the moment, I am delighted to say-I can have access to the same magazines which regularly have columns and columns of dirty phone call services where people who feel the need can ring and hear 10 minutes of heavy breathing at great cost, if that is what turns them on. Telecom has as little right, in my view, to interfere with that one-to-one communication on Discovery as it has to interfere with what transpires between a person who picks up a telephone and talks privately to another person. As far as I am concerned, in this country people can say what they like.

If one looks at the Discovery situation, the answers that I received to the questions that I placed on notice for Estimates Committee E show perfectly clearly that what is happening in the Discovery service is the establishment of what is known as the publishing model for Telecom. Senator Collins is now saying that people are entitled to have Telecom send into private homes material which is degrading to women.

         â€”I understood Senator Collins to say a moment ago that, so far as he was concerned, the so-called philosophy that has been put forward by Janet Strickland ought to be observed in this case; in other words, Telecom should be able to act as agent and publisher for the material which is provided by the sexploit profiteers and undermines the status of women. That is what the Minister is saying. That is what Discovery is saying. Discovery says that Telecom will not be the moral arbiter in these particular cases. What we are talking about is the use of Telecom lines by sexploiters to undermine the status of women in Australia, not individual phone calls or communications between individuals. We are talking about Discovery. In answer to my questions on standards, Discovery indicates clearly that it intends to adopt what is legally the case for published material.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That begs the question as to whether what goes onto television sets or onto computer screens in Australian homes should be the same as what applies in the Australian Capital Territory for pornographic videos. That goes to the question of whether what is being done here is pre-empting any decision in future as to whether pay television will be based on the publishing model or on the broadcast model. That is what this is all about. Those are the precedents that are being established here. Apparently, the Minister supports that sort of precedent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a very important issue that we are discussing at this present stage because Telecom wants to be a player in pay television. Now Telecom is setting this up through Discovery. The board of directors of Telecom has not done this. I appreciate that the Minister has said that he is going to ask the board of directors, through Mr Beazley, for its view and also ask Mr Beazley for his view, but Discovery has established a precedent that the publishing model will be used for the transmission of material from porn merchants onto screens, at this stage computer screens, in the private homes of subscribers.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the difference, if we accept that, when the same group-the Mature Media Group-says, `We want to engage in this service'? It has indicated that it wants to be involved in the supply of this material for the purpose of pay television. It is on record as saying that. Unless the board of directors overturns what is happening and unless the Minister directs Telecom to have another look at it, a principle has been established which then provides for the publishing model to be the basis for pay television, and not the broadcast model.
       </para>
       <para>
        But let us get to what we were dealing with, that is, the question of the Janet Strickland report and the responses that were given to me on 0055 numbers.

That is what the Minister is saying.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister shakes his head. Is he not saying that? I thought that that was what he said. I asked the deliberate question as to whether a reading of the recommendations of Strickland would indicate that the material on the new opt-in service-that is, the specific 0055 service-would be far more degrading to women than the material about which there is a current outcry. I thought that his answer was no. The Minister shakes his head now.

        Senator Harradine asked me, as he said quite correctly, whether I agreed that an interpretation of recommendation 2 of Janet Strickland about the opt-in service-that is, that adults should have as a basic principle the maximum opportunity to read, see and hear what they want, provided that it is not unsolicited and provided that children do not have access to it and so on-would mean of necessity that the material would be degrading to women. That was the question. My answer to that question was no. I think that is an extraordinary assumption to make, and I say no again. It is absolutely nonsense to suggest, as Senator Harradine just did-and the Hansard record will show it; I noted his comments-that I was advocating that Telecom would have the opportunity to send pornographic material unsolicited into people's homes. That is just nonsense.
       </para>

        Recommendation 2 says that adults, as a general principle, should have the right to be able to see and hear in private what they want, that people should be protected from receiving unsolicited information-that is, information they do not want-and that children should be protected. I have no difficulty in asserting that, quite distinct from Senator Harradine's view, this Government has no difficulty in living with a principle like that. It is one that I strongly support.

        I will say again for the fifth or sixth time-and I know that Senator Harradine has a job to do and, fair enough, he is doing it-that there are absolutely no grounds on which Senator Harradine or anyone else can make an assumption that, by having regard to Janet Strickland's recommendation 2, material is going to be degrading of women.

         â€”Indeed, and Senator Walters has a particular view of the world that I am about 15 quantum leaps away from, thank God. The fact is that we are once again debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. It is a question of Senator Harradine's interpretation of recommendation 2 or mine. Both of them, I would suggest, are probably from our respective points of view equally valid. All I am saying -and I say it again-is that there are no grounds to simply assert as a matter of fact that, if the Committee does have regard to recommendation 2, the material that is then transmitted over a telephone line will be of necessity degrading to women.

I was talking in the context of the opt-in service. I think that that sort of red herring is unnecessary. However, Senator Collins has not answered the question that I asked. If the material is not going to be worse than currently is the case, why then does Janet Strickland in her report indicate that complaints about advertisements for the new adult telephone information services may increase? Why would complaints about the advertising of the new service increase if it were not going to be more offensive to people who may see it advertised in various places?

        Everybody knows, except presumably the Minister, that the material is going to be worse. Ask Telecom about that. The committee that is being established, we are told, is going to have a minister of religion or two on it. It matters not whether ministers comprise the whole committee, it is tied hand and foot to observe this specious principle and this specious argument. It comes back to the question as to whether Telecom is going to be used for that purpose. I would like to know why Janet Strickland has said that there are likely to be more complaints about advertisements for the new service.

        But I feel that certain questions I have raised have not been answered. Perhaps the following in particular could be taken on notice. Have any service providers breached any of the operational requirements relating to message or advertising standards-that is, the current message and advertising standards-contained in the operational requirements which are part and parcel of the contract of a service which a service provider must pay? Telecom answered that partially on page 5 of the answers that it has given us. In respect of those particular matters, was a determination made under clause 8(4) of the contract? Given the fact that Telecom officers in their answer to me have indicated that certain action is being taken about on-disc connections and the fact that these breaches have taken place, is there any problem with wiping indecent material off 0055 now? Why can Telecom not just wipe the material from 0055?

This issue has its derivation not as the 0055 numbers but rather the international publications that use phone numbers from another country which, when they cross the STD codes of Australia, are now causing major concern. For example, one of my constituents has written to me-and I will make a copy of this representation available to the Minister-concerning various numbers in a company switchboard that is now deriving from a British magazine called Electric Blue which then lists a number of what I would call kinky and very unusual types of phone calls. The phone numbers listed against each of the services start with the number 089, followed by a series of numbers. Well, 089 is the STD prefix for the Northern Territory and, as these magazines are widely distributed in newsagencies around Australia and are generally available, it is causing concern to the Telecom subscriber in the Northern Territory who is now receiving unsolicited and unwanted calls which actually derive from a British sales campaign.

I am not personally familiar with the problem, but of course it does not relate in any way to the 0055 matter that we are now discussing; it is simply a question of overseas numbers duplicating numbers in Australia. I am certainly happy to have a look at the problem but, if the magazine is an overseas magazine, if it is publishing British telephone numbers which are genuine for that service which simply happen to duplicate similar telephone numbers in Australia, on the face of it it would be very difficult, I would think, for any sensible action to be taken about it.

         â€”No, Mr Chairman. What I am is saying is that I have learnt in the brief time that I have been here to discount by about 99 per cent everything Senator Walters says. What I am very sensibly suggesting to Senator Walters is that rather than simply canvassing in broad terms a specific complaint she has got and expecting me to give a Government commitment on the basis of it-which is an extraordinary proposition-if she has got specific concerns and can in fact produce evidence that children have been accessing services which are not designed for them, I prevail upon her to please provide it at the earliest opportunity to Telecom.

But there are a lot of parents who do object and who have very grave concerns that this does occur. I can assure the Minister that it does occur and if he wants it chapter and verse, we will do so. But is Telecom suggesting for one minute that it believes young children will not avail themselves of this facility? That is a question I would like answered by Telecom officers. Do they believe that children do not avail themselves? Are they expecting the politicians to bring them proof before they accept that children--

         â€”Senator Walters is talking about two different things. She again misquoted what I said yesterday. She talked about what I said in respect of the sexual advice services-and I must say that in my view they are excellent-that are available on 0055. I specified the ones I was talking about. We are talking about two different things. Advice on masturbation, impotence, frigidity or other common sexual problems is available on 0055. My own family doctor tells me that as far as he is aware it is accurate advice. I might add that it is entirely uncontroversial.

        What I said yesterday, and I stand by it, is that I would have no difficulty with my 12 year-old son wanting to hear over a telephone, rather than from me, any advice that he needs-which he probably would need at this age of his life-on areas such as masturbation, impotence, frigidity or any of these other things. I must say that, here again, it is just a question of one's personal view of the world. At the age of 12 or 13, as a child is approaching sexual maturity, parents have got an obligation to provide this advice. I can assure Senator Walters, having accessed these particular numbers she is talking about, that we are talking about different things entirely. Senator Walters is taking the very simple approach that anything that has got sex attached to it has all got to be lumped into one big pot and it is all dirty.

The advice is so innocuous that I would have no difficulty in my 12 year-old son having access to it. But what we are talking about is the sexually explicit material which is access barred.

         â€”Last night during the Committee of the Whole debate, I gave the Minister a very clear example of the problem that constituents in my State were having in lodging complaints with Telecom on this very issue. I know there have been a number of complaints. I asked the Minister whether that was a typical problem that people were having right around Australia. It is not good enough for him to come in here now and say that members of parliament should be giving examples. I can tell him, for example, of a 14 year-old boy that ran up a telephone bill of $37 over two or three months. His mother could not understand why the phone bill was like that. It was only after I gave some publicity to this matter that she realised what the problem was and had a talk to her son. It is not good enough for the Minister to hide behind the sorts of things he has been saying.

        The 0055 numbers are all accessible to children no matter what kind of information is being purveyed. What is he going to do about it? Why is Telecom not taking any action although it recognises what is happening? I understand the United States Congress has stopped this sort of stuff going over American telephones because children were using it. Senator Walters has asked a pretty fair question. I want to make sure that Senator Collins understands that children can and do have access to it. Telecom is aware of complaints. It would be aware of a lot more complaints if the system for lodging complaints was made simpler, instead of people being told to write to their local newspaper and having to be very pushy in order to get Telecom actually to record a complaint.

My point is that the Government's philosophy-we have been told by the Minister umpteen times today-is that adults ought to be able to see, read and hear whatever they like, so long as children are protected, bearing in mind certain restrictions, such as child pornography, et cetera. But he stresses that children should be protected. At the moment Telecom is making-I do not know how much; I will come to that a bit later-perhaps millions of dollars. It is hauling in all this money and allowing access by children to all this 0055 information. The Minister tells us not to worry and says it is barred access. Well, it is not barred access; the Minister is totally wrong.

This means that anyone who wants to get out of the system can do so at no cost and all charges are separately identified on an account.

        Having said that, I also conceded to Senator Harradine yesterday-he has acknowledged it twice today and I have confirmed that acknowledgment-that there are concerns about this service which I consider to be legitimate, and yesterday I said so. All I can do is reiterate the commitment I gave yesterday, which was confirmed again this morning to Senator Harradine when he raised it, and assure the Committee and Senator Walters that, in respect of all the matters that have been raised-in particular, and I mentioned it again this morning, the suggestion for having an opt-in approach rather than an opt-out approach to 0055 is probably worthy of consideration-I will ensure that they are brought to the attention of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). I will ask the Minister to ensure that they are discussed. Now that the service has been operating and now that this discussion has been generated, it is appropriate that these matters be discussed by the board of Telecom. I will ensure that that happens.

         â€”Telecom is not even enforcing its own operational requirements. What the Minister said this morning and yesterday is contrary to Telecom's operational requirements for message standard. The Telecom board has never agreed to this specious argument about adults being free to read and view what they wish. That specious argument allows Telecom to act as a publisher for the sexploit merchants. But we are talking about message content, message standards. These are operational requirements that are part and parcel of the contract which Telecom enters into with the service providers. Therefore, the service providers are bound by that contract. Message standard 1.1 states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        (a) This standard has been prepared with regard to the following principle:-
       </para>
       <para>
        That all persons calling any 0055 Information Service are entitled to protection from exposure to messages of an indecent, obscene or sexually suggestive nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Service Provider will not provide ``knowingly or negligently'' on any 0055 number allocated to it, any information which, in any way, may be interpreted as indecent, obscene, offensive or sexually titillating or denoting sexual suggestion or sexual fantasy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask the Minister: why does Telecom not enforce those operational requirements? The answer provided to my question 12, which related to this, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom's position is that message content should conform to the standard as specified in Operational Requirements 1.1-
       </para>
       <para>
        I have just read that. The answer continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been no change to policy since the issuing of paper No. 3 dated 31st January 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why is Telecom not enforcing that? Why was it necessary to get Janet Strickland in to push for the lines to be opened up so that worse material could be included on them? That is pretty plain. I ask honourable senators to consider the current message standards for 0055. Clearly, Telecom is not enforcing that. Why does it not do so immediately? As Senator Walters said, it has legal contracts with the service providers; it can enforce them overnight.

         â€”As I have said at some tedious length in this debate, what judgment one makes on the content of those messages very much depends on where one sits in the world. In my view, Telecom is behaving in an extremely responsible manner. Senator Harradine's views on Janet Strickland are well known; I am extremely familiar with them, and he is entitled to them. But I do not see anything wrong with Telecom's judgment in setting up what I found to be a comprehensive and useful set of recommendations by Janet Strickland, who, because of her background, has significant and considerable experience in the area of censorship. Again, the approach that Telecom is taking to set up a committee to establish standards, with direct community input, despite sniggering from those opposite, is the appropriate way to go. That is what Telecom is doing. When those standards and guidelines are established-the committee will be set up within a month-then it will be appropriate for that matter to be canvassed, as no doubt it will be, in the Senate.

We cannot account for or explain the difference between our standards and those of the Minister, nor can we explain the difference between our standards and those of the female senators on the Australian Labor Party side, who profess to champion the causes of feminism and the rights of women. They profess to protect all of those things, yet last night, when the Minister swore in this chamber, one of his colleagues, who has just now left the chamber, sat there and laughed because we took offence at the remark. They now react in the same way to our taking offence at things that are in this phone book readily accessible by all people. Examples include: `Abortion. Who can help?'; `Condoms and Safe Sex'; `Contraception'. Why should not those seeking advice on these matters go to a doctor? Why does the Minister insist that all of this must be on telephone lines?

        I come back to the question that I put on notice to the Minister on 18 September this year, and to which he responded in his usual most flippant way. I asked what it cost for Janet Strickland to do this review or whatever it was that she was asked to do-heaven only knows-and the Minister said that it was commercial confidentiality between Telecom and Janet Strickland and Associates. Because it was an arrangement between Telecom and Janet Strickland, is it not taxpayers' money that has paid for that review? If so, are we not entitled as taxpayers, and the public of Australia, to know how much that cost? I ask three questions. First, is it taxpayers' money? Secondly, how much did that review cost? Thirdly, how much is Janet Strickland going to be paid for becoming the Telecom arbitrator?

        In respect of the other matters raised by the honourable senator, I have no doubt that the consultancy would have been paid by Telecom from its revenue, which it gains from the provision of services. It is a net contributor to the public wealth in this country, not a mendicant organisation that relies on taxpayers' money; in fact, it provides a considerable flow of revenue to the public purse the other way. But one of the reasons that these organisations are set up a step distance from government is to provide them with the flexibility of taking commercial decisions. The Telecom board has entered into an arrangement with Janet Strickland, as no doubt it enters into arrangements with a whole lot of other people, which quite properly are considered to be commercially confidential. There is no question about their right to do that.

         â€”If that is the case, why on earth can the Minister not disclose how much money Janet Strickland was paid and is to be paid? I believe the subscribers of Telecom have every right in the world to know why their telephone charges and costs are continuing to escalate when Telecom is spending money and for some reason or another the Minister is not prepared to disclose the amount. No-one can tell me or anybody else that it is straight out commercial confidentiality. It is obviously a very, very substantial amount for this charade to go on.

         â€”I have two questions. The first one is in respect of a question quite validly raised by Senator Knowles. She raised it a long time before I did and she raised it as a question on notice; I raised it on notice following the Estimates Committee. It is in respect of payments made to Janet Strickland and Associates Pty Ltd by Telecom. Senator Collins said to me, in a voice loaded with inference, `Oh, I know your views about Janet Strickland.' I have met Janet Strickland; she is quite a pleasant person. However, we are dealing with what is, as the Minister conceded, a very important issue. It is the question of who is to make the decision about where to draw the line. In order to have a paper prepared to bomb Telecom's own current standards-which I read out a moment ago; I wonder why they were not okay-Telecom appointed Janet Strickland. Last night I asked whether Telecom knew Janet Strickland, prior to her appointment for this purpose, was an advocate for the Film and Video Coalition, that part of her consultancy was to oppose moves to tighten censorship guidelines and that she is on the record as being opposed to the tightening of guidelines.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It was-it should have been-important for Telecom to know the views of the person it was appointing. Janet Strickland has brought out a report which recommends the establishment of a committee to determine standards, but that committee will be bound by the `philosophy' that adults are free to read and view what they wish. As I have indicated before, that is a specious argument because adults are not free to view anti-female propaganda unless it is published by Telecom on their computers or they hear it over the telephone. The question is whether the Government is prepared to allow Telecom to act, in effect, as a publisher and agent for the sexploiters. That standards committee will be bound by the Strickland philosophy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Janet Strickland then recommended the appointment of a Telecom service arbitrator to receive complaints from the public about content and advertising. On page 15 of her report, Janet Strickland says:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . `adult' messages will only be accessible on an `opt-in' basis, the number of complaints received or disputes arising about the content of the Telephone Information Service messages are unlikely to be substantial.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason for that presumably is that open access will not be available to them. Nevertheless, the same type of material which has the same mediating effect on the minds of listeners and viewers to Discovery and the listeners of 0055 will be there-that is, the same anti-female propaganda will be going over.
       </para>
       <para>
        Janet Strickland does say that complaints about advertisements for adult telephone information service messages may increase. She recommends the appointment of an arbitrator. Telecom has accepted that recommendation and appointed her as the arbitrator. There was no consultation at all-none with the Minister, none with the Parliament, and none with the public-about the appointment of Janet Strickland as the arbitrator. I want answers to the following questions: how much was Janet Strickland and Associates Pty Ltd paid for reporting on the 0055 service? How much will she be paid as arbitrator, to do a job which she herself concedes will not amount to much? I think this is important, because we have had discussions about Telecom's pay rates before in this chamber going back many years, as a matter of fact; I think it all started in 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that we know what Telecom has paid for this consultancy and what it proposes to pay for the appointment of Janet Strickland. I remind the Committee that that appointment was undertaken by Telecom without advertising the job, without consultation with the community, without consultation with the Parliament, and without consultation with the Minister.

       <para>
        From a reading of Janet Strickland's report, it appears to me that Austel has just washed its hands of everything. I cannot understand why that is the case because, when we were dealing with the Austel legislation here, the impression was given by the Government that Austel would be overviewing the services that are provided by Telecom and presumably by other players who might enter into the field. The Austel Act requires Austel to ensure `that carriers achieve the highest possible levels of accountability and responsiveness to customer and community needs'. It has as one of its objectives `to ensure the proper use of telecommunications networks in the supply of value added services'.

         â€”I think that I am the concluding speaker in this debate. It is quite clear to all of us that many questions remain unanswered, and the Minister has given an undertaken to get answers. He has also promised that he will have them chased up and answered properly.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Last night at 10.15, I asked the Minister three questions which were capable of being answered by the officers present, or those who should have been present-after all, Senator Harradine gave notice that he wanted to have the question of the 0055 numbers reserved to be debated in the Committee of the Whole. If those officers were not present, it should have been perfectly possible for the Minister, either at that time, or first thing this morning, to have made a telephone call and got the specific responses that were needed. At 10.15 this morning, that is, 12 hours after I originally asked those questions, the Minister was quite abusive and unhelpful-certainly at least unhelpful-in his response to me when I asked again for answers to those questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is now over 13 hours since those questions were asked. They may seem to be trivial to the Minister, but they are important to us. Let me demonstrate why. The 0055 numbers are available to all Australians, including children. Telecom had with the service providers of the sex telephone calls contractual arrangements which entitled it to discontinue those services based on content or advertising. Despite complaints, Telecom chose not to exercise its contractual rights and instead did what Labor Party governments certainly do, but other governments have been known to do; that is, it set up a committee. The whole question was a bit hard, so Telecom set up a committee with Mrs Strickland, whose views were known to the Government-and I put it no higher than that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mrs Strickland came back with some very predictable recommendations which have now been sitting around for about six weeks. The Minister has told us that the recommendations will be implemented within about a month. One recommendation was to set up yet another committee comprising an independent chairman-any committee's outcome is likely to be determined very much by the care with which the choice of chairman is made; one arbitrator, who we believe to be Mrs Strickland, and we know what views she will hold; one representative of Telecom-in other words, the status quo; and two service providers whose vested interests are obviously to maintain the status quo. We then have a recommendation that there be two consultative groups taking part-a minority. We cannot be sure, but we believe that two out of seven members on this committee might be interested in the effects of this service on consumer groups and on society generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        I asked the Minister a specific question as to which consumer groups had been consulted over the last six weeks or perhaps more, and that simple question has not been able to be answered in 13 hours. I also asked the Minister which consumer groups had been asked to put in nominations for possible appointment to this committee, which is important to our future. Whether it will be able to do anything worth while is another matter, but it has the potential to be extremely important. He was not able to answer that either.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of complaints has been very much an issue. I also drew attention to the difficulties that consumers have in lodging complaints with Telecom and asked for that to be investigated and for a response. I have not had a response as to whether the situation that my constituents in Tasmania are experiencing is typical of the situation around Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find 13 hours of non-response from the Government and from Telecom to be totally unacceptable. I therefore propose to give the Government one more chance. I intend now to give the Government the opportunity to get those answers for us while the Committee of the Whole is investigating the report on the Attorney-General's Department. I move:

         â€”The Government will be opposing this motion because, in terms of a time-wasting exercise-and I was hoping that this would not have to be said-this would have to be a monumental one and I hope the Committee will reject it. The unbelievably specious ground on which this motion has been moved-and I intend to give a very precise response to Senator Newman on this-is that the three questions that were asked in this debate late last night have not been answered this morning.

         â€”Thirteen hours ago. Honourable senators will be voting on this motion and are entitled to know just how unreasonable, mischievous and silly this motion is. I gave an undertaking to the chamber last night that I would provide Senator Newman with answers to her questions by the end of business today, and I will ensure that that happens. I do not think I have missed a deadline in respect of questions yet. I thought that was a reasonable undertaking.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What I said more specifically was-and I do not think I could have been more frank or honest with the chamber-that I had no intention of dragging someone out of bed last night. Thousands of hours are spent by officers in serving Senate committees, and Senator Newman should know it. Thousands of hours are put in by public servants, as they have to do, rightly, to service these Senate committees. I certainly considered the questions important enough to get answers, but I did not think that tonight was an unreasonable time to provide them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will give Senator Newman an account of my movements in the last 13 hours to explain why I did not personally drag a Telecom officer out of bed late last night to provide her with these answers this morning. I worked in my office until one o'clock this morning. I left at the crack of dawn and went out to have a look at the new Siemens-Plessey radar system that is being offered for installation at Sydney airport. I got back here, having had what I thought was an extremely useful morning looking at this new radar flight system, at a quarter to 10.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have asked my office, of course, in the meantime, as I always do, to pursue this matter with Telecom. It is doing so, and I will have an answer to all of Senator Newman's questions at the time I gave an undertaking last night to have it; that is, by the close of business today. I have always, and my record will show it, treated all questions asked in committee seriously and I have always personally pursued answers to them and made sure that they are provided the instant they are available.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Newman makes this suggestion when officers are present, and there are more of them outside. It is not just a question of inconveniencing members of this chamber; it is a question of inconveniencing a large number of officers who have already spent a considerable amount of time-they are not Canberra-based officers-here in Canberra at the service of this Senate on something as specious as this. I say again to the Committee, with all reason, that I gave Senator Newman an undertaking last night that I will have answers to her three questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        To get to the nub of this motion, I do not think that the fate of Tasmania is going to rest on getting an answer at this instant rather than later on today-and, hopefully, I will be able to provide this immediately after the lunch break-as to which people Telecom has consulted about 0055. Considering what I know of the efforts that these officers have put in-and I do know-to dig them out of bed at midnight to provide answers by this morning I think would have been unreasonable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of just how unreasonable it is, I just say-and I can assure Senator Harradine that I am not having a crack at him-that honourable senators are also entitled to know the background of the discussion on this issue before they vote on this motion. The appropriate place to discuss issues of this detail, without question-there is not a senator in here who would deny it, and in fact Senator Harradine confirmed it this morning-is in the committee process where, as Senator Harradine said, it is done across the table in a far less formal fashion. Of course, it is far more productive for that reason, with the officers participating to the same extent as the Minister in providing honourable senators with information, which is the point of the Estimates exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The difficulty was that no-one indicated that 0055 officers were required at those Estimates Committee hearings until Senator Harradine-and fair enough- requested that they be present two hours prior to the Committee sitting. I can tell honourable senators that, despite that incredibly short notice and despite the fact that these officers are based in Sydney, not Canberra, efforts were made-as they always would be, I am sure-to get officers out of their offices, onto planes and to Canberra, despite the fact that this is an issue of such great moment that no-one in the Opposition requested that this information be provided at the appropriate place, which is the Estimates Committee itself. Neither Senator Newman nor any single member of the Opposition did that. The only person who did request these officers to be present was Senator Harradine.
       </para>
       <para>
        This was all explained at the Committee. Efforts were made to comply and to get these officers on aircraft. It simply was not physically possible, with two hours notice that they were required, to get them there.

As I said before, no Opposition member even asked. As a result of that, the opportunity to have this matter debated in the proper place, to use this Senate chamber with some expedition and efficiency, was lost.

Senator Harradine accepted that and took up the offer-and, as far as I know, he is the only one who did-to have, after the Senate Estimates Committee hearing, a full and detailed briefing from Telecom officers because of the lack of notice that was given to get them to the Senate Committee hearings, which is what should have happened.

        I have never forgotten my first Senate Estimates experience. I can remember talking to Senator Parer about it, actually, in the corridor outside. I was appalled by that experience because the way in which it was run-and no-one in here would deny it-when we were in the old Parliament House, was scandalous. I will tell honourable senators what my first Estimates committee experience was: to come down to the old committee room in the old Parliament House to see a phalanx- and people know this is true. We have made considerable progress because of the courtesies and commonsense-in response to Senator Reid's interjection-of giving a little prior notice to ensure that people are not ripped out of their normal jobs for 18 or 20 hours for nothing. We have made considerable progress, as Senator Reid knows, in providing some sensible advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        What Senator Reid is saying by her interjection is that we do not have to provide any management of the system at all; that senators have no obligation; that we are special, superbeings who can just expect people-highly paid public servants, all or any of them-who might conceivably be asked a question to turn up. Senator Reid knows that is not what we are striving to do in this chamber, but that is how we used to do it. It was a scandal and a disgrace.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have never forgotten my first experience in Estimates. A group of four officers turned up at 2 o'clock in the afternoon for that Senate Estimates committee meeting. They waited in Parliament House the entire day for their little section to be dealt with. At 11 o'clock at night-and I was sitting next to Senator Parer when this happened-after waiting all that time, they presented themselves at the witness table and were not asked a solitary question.

It is not a question of the Chairman running the Committee, and Senator Vanstone knows it.

         â€”The Committee has heard about wasting time and we notice that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has just run out of his allotted speaking time of 15 minutes. He has talked about the courtesies and commonsense that should be extended to officers. On a number of occasions yesterday and today I have noticed officers in the lounge area adjacent to the chamber who have been kept waiting because of the time that has been taken in this chamber by Senator Collins's long, tedious and boring answers. Many of his answers are based totally on anecdotal comments of his own personal views and do not reflect the policies of the Government or provide the information that is being sought by senators.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would like to support the motion of Senator Newman that the Committee needs to seek information before the Committee proceeds. Although I placed on notice before the Estimates Committee in the first week of September questions in the area of Minister Collins's responsibility, it took some six to seven weeks for all of them to be answered. At one stage, Senator Collins took umbrage when I suggested that perhaps some of that delay had been occasioned because a Northern Territory election was in progress and some of the answers that came back might have been embarrassing to the Federal Government. Senator Collins subsequently assured me in this chamber that, of course, none of them came back except on the days on which they reached his good office. I only hope that there was no blocking in the corridors in any way in getting that information returned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important to note that Senator Newman is stressing the point that the Committee needs to be assured that we can have answers in the appropriate time. Certainly, from my experience, we have had to put up with delays in answers to formal questions on notice that could have been answered directly and immediately. There was no need for any of those answers to have been withheld. There was no need for any of them to have been held up or kept back. As Senator Newman has very rightly said, it is important that the answers to the questions very properly asked yesterday should have been provided to this chamber this morning. There is no way that the Committee can have confidence in what this Minister says. Instead of getting answers and information, all we get are anecdotes and excuses.

Of the 2,111 questions asked, most of the answers to which I know will never see the light of day despite the extraordinary amount of money they cost to collect, only 12 questions-that is 0.5 per cent of the questions asked-remain outstanding at this time. Frankly, I think that is an outstanding response from the department.

        Senator Harradine placed 40 questions on notice relating to the 0055 and Discovery services. Senator Harradine knows that those questions were not received by the Department until 8 October, that is, some 18 days after the Senate Estimates Committee meeting. In fact, Senator Harradine lodged them, I think, only 14 days after. That is a matter of no moment because he is not complaining.
       </para>
       <para>
        In response to what Senator Tambling has said, I do not think the fact that only 12 questions out of 2,111 are still outstanding at this point in time would lead to too much criticism. This outrageous motion would further inconvenience officers who have been here for a significant amount of time to provide us with a service. There is an obligation to exercise some kind of management in this chamber. The attitude that is being adopted, to just lay back and let officers be at our beck and call, cannot be sustained.

        There are three outstanding questions on which we are asked to divide in order to postpone this entire procedure. This would further back up the other officers waiting outside to be called.

This is not a sustainable reason, with respect, for this Committee to be further inconvenienced and, I might add, for a very large number of departmental officers also to be inconvenienced because of our mismanagement.

         â€”Senator Collins has indicated on a couple of occasions that these issues are specious ones. I do not know whether he is talking about the issue of the community's complaints about Discovery and 0055. If he is referring to that, they are certainly not specious or unimportant questions; they are very important questions.

        In so far as Discovery is concerned, if the Discovery management is allowed to get away with what it is doing now, the precedent is being set for porn pay television. Let us not make any mistake about that at all; that is what the situation is. With Discovery, Telecom, without the approval of its board of management, has established the publishing model for the provision of computer porn into Australian homes via their computer network screens. What is the difference between that and television porn? That and the inherent nature of the Discovery service are the reasons that I have been raising these questions.

         â€”I will do it briefly. They are important questions. I hope that Senator Collins waits to hear what I am going to say about the motion-shortly. As far as 0055 is concerned, here is a situation where Telecom is about to expand its sexploit business. How is it going to do that? It is going to do that by developing a system where there will be a particular code within 0055, and the material content of that service will be far more degrading to women than the material about which there are current complaints. I believe that the matters dealt with by way of questions that I have raised, that Senator Newman has raised, that Senator Walters has raised, and that Senator Knowles has raised-and other people as well-are very important issues indeed.
        </para>

       <para>
        Senator Collins correctly indicated that the most appropriate place for these questions to have been dealt with would have been during the Estimates Committee hearings. He seems to indicate that somehow I was at fault for not giving sufficient notice to enable officers of Telecom to be there. Mr Fish, the Telecom officer who had written the letters to those people who were complaining, was in fact there and he was not prepared to answer the questions. He is the Manager, External Relations, Corporate Secretariat. He was there. He is the one that has been answering the questions asked by the public. Was I to expect that somebody else should be responsible for answering the questions? He is the one that has been answering the questions about Discovery service. He is the one that has been answering the public's questions about 0055. He was present on that occasion. Why was he not able to answer the questions? Since Senator Collins has raised it-I did not raise it; I was prepared to let it go- why was Mr Fish not able to answer our questions, since he has been the one that has been answering questions asked by the public by way of letter?
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom is the only public authority that I know of that has not, prior to Estimates, met with its officers and said, `What are the things that we are likely to be asked about?'. What were the things that they were likely to be asked about? There had been complaints about these services. Surely, Telecom should have been aware that questions would be asked. So I do not accept that. I was not going to raise it; Senator Collins raised it. I do not complain about the length of time that it has taken for answers to come from Telecom officials. I must say that Senator Collins, Telecom and the Department of Transport and Communications have been meticulous in the way that they have gone about dealing with questions to the Estimates committees. I also acknowledge the work that has been done by the Estimates committees to get those questions in-so far as they have been answered.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason for all of this debate in the Committee of the Whole is that the answers raised a series of other questions, which Senator Collins now has taken on notice. Senator Newman's questions are not the only ones that have been taken on notice. There are far more questions that have been taken on notice-from me, for one. I am prepared to accept Senator Collins's undertaking to provide answers in the time frame that he has mentioned; that is, by this afternoon. Would Senator Collins give an indication of the time frame that it might take for the answers to come back from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and from the Board of Telecom in respect of the questions that have been raised by me and some others in this debate?
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the individual questions are concerned, it is not for me to say whether I should support Senator Newman. Every honourable senator is entitled to make his or her request for responses. If Senator Collins has indicated that by this afternoon he will be providing the direct answers to those questions, maybe we should take that on faith.

I notice that he is nodding assent to that and does appreciate it. I was responding directly to what I thought was a bit of off-the-top-of-the-head filibustering that Senator Tambling was probably asked to do when he criticised the length of time that had been taken to provide answers.

        I think the answer I gave provided pretty significant ammunition against supporting this motion. Of the 2,100 questions asked on notice, only 12 have not yet been answered: that is 0.05 per cent of the questions. I think that is a pretty fair effort from the Department. I gave an undertaking to Senator Newman last night. The questions are not exactly earth- shaking. I did not at any stage suggest who I treated them trivially. I have never treated questions put to the Committee trivially. As I said before, there are plenty of honourable senators in this chamber who can attest to the diligence that I apply in getting answers to questions that are asked. I have always provided them.

        I did have another obligation this morning, in company with Senator Kernot-who I was very pleased came in her capacity as the Australian Democrats spokesperson on aviation-to look at some rather important equipment to do with air management at Sydney Airport. I ensured that the questions were noted. I gave an undertaking to the Committee last night, and these questions again relate to the people and the organisations that Telecom consulted about 0055 and a particular matter raised by a constituent in Tasmania. I repeat that I have given an undertaking to provide the Committee with those answers before the end of today. I will discharge that obligation. That is no reason to keep the Committee waiting--

I have to give credit and say that I think the Senate has made considerable progress, since we have moved to the new Parliament House, by a bit of tighter management and a bit of courtesy being extended by those on both sides, with people letting other people know what they want to know about, in avoiding rafts of public servants having to waste their precious time-which we pay for-and ours on this exercise.

The Minister is responsible for the time that has been taken on this particular section of Estimates Committee E.

If his Department or his office had rung through for the information at nine o'clock this morning, I believe it would be nothing but gross incompetence if it could not have been made available within at least two hours. However, it is now three hours since the working time commenced for the Department. If the Minister had really tried-I am sick to death of hearing him say how good he is-I believe the officers could have responded in the period.

        The Minister is ignoring the fact that if the answers to Senator Newman's questions are given after this section of the Appropriation Bill has been finalised, Senator Newman will not have the ability to ask any additional questions on the answers given. As the Minister knows, this is the only time honourable senators have to ask a series of questions on answers given. The Minister understands that. I guess that is the reason why he will not give us the answers during this consideration of the appropriations.

         â€”I wish to raise briefly a matter I raised at the Estimates Committee and it is referred to in the report under subprogram 1.2, the Solicitor-General. I raised it on 13 September at the Estimates Committee hearing. I raised it again in the Senate when I spoke on the Appropriation Bills. The substance of the matter is the fact that the Attorney-General's Department or the Solicitor-General does not charge departments of state for legal work that is done for them. From one point of view we might say that it is money merely changing hands. What disturbs me is that there seems to be no accurate record of the taxpayers' money which is spent in the Government pursuing legal action of any kind. It puts any other person at an enormous disadvantage when the Commonwealth has unlimited resources to pursue legal action.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What I was speaking about in particular was the question of Mr Hans Milton's action in the Small Claims Court in Canberra, which he won with a judgment of $929.49, and which the Department of Finance or the Commissioner for Superannuation wished to appeal. Any other citizen in this country would have thought pretty deeply about whether or not to spend the legal costs to pursue the action further. But, with no responsibility required whatever for somebody pursuing such an action, the Department proceeded to instruct the Solicitor-General to lodge an appeal.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the same period, the Department of Finance issued a press release, reported in the Canberra Times, indicating that in future this would not be the case. But as far as I know to this moment, notwithstanding that decision, the claim against Mr Milton is still being appealed, despite the enormous costs to the taxpayers. I received some answers as a result of the questions I raised at the Estimates Committee. They indicated that, yes, Mr Milton did institute proceedings and, yes, he obtained a judgment in the Small Claims Court; that no costs are awarded in the small claims court apart from disbursements, and indicated the total number of disbursements. The interesting piece of information was that the work done by the Commonwealth in this small matter was by a principal legal officer, amounting to some 40 hours, and by a senior legal officer, amounting to some eight hours. The costs thus incurred amounted to about $1,480.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, I challenge that figure. There is not a legal firm in the country that would be charging out at that rate if it is paying solicitors the amount of money that one pays principal legal officers and senior legal officers for their work. A principal legal officer is in the salary range of just over $50,000 to $53,000. A senior legal officer is in the range of over $42,000 to $45,000. If one takes the 40 hours on a 38-hour-week basis, it is absurd to try to tell the chamber that the legal costs that the Commonwealth has incurred pursuing this are as little as $1,480. We all know that is nonsense because it does not, in addition to the salary, take into account all the other costs that a legal firm has to bear in order to operate and to function as the solicitor for a department of state in this matter. What I would like to know from the Minister is whether it is a fact that the Commonwealth is still, with scant regard for the taxpayers of this country, pursuing this matter on appeal, or has the appeal been withdrawn?

         â€”I am unable to find out from the officers whether the appeal is being furthered. I will try to find that answer as soon as I can. In relation to the real point that I think Senator Reid is making-and she makes the point by illustration using this case-I believe that there will be a submission going to the Government shortly in relation to user pays principles applying between the Australian Government Solicitor and departments of the Commonwealth. I believe that this will put a very real constraint on departments so that they have to consider very carefully whether in fact they should pursue a particular matter through the various stages, such as has occurred in the case of Mr Hans Milton. It will also require the Australian Government Solicitor to note more carefully the time spent, and therefore the cost involved, in providing a particular legal service to the client department or Commonwealth agency.

        I think Senator Reid's point is well made in general. As to her specific question, I will get that information as soon as I can. I believe that if the question of cost recovery and user pays is adopted, as is envisaged by the Australian Government Solicitor, then many of the concerns that Senator Reid expressed will be dealt with.

         â€”The report of Estimates Committee E specifically recommends that further matters in relation to the administration of the Family Court be discussed. There are a few matters that I know Senator Tate is aware of that I want to raise with him very briefly. I can do it in one speech, or not much more than that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As Senator Tate is no doubt aware, Family Court jurisdiction is a very emotive and sensitive jurisdiction for the litigants involved. Everything the Commonwealth can do to facilitate the proper administration of those family law courts I assume it would want to do. I know the situation is, as in all matters, that there can only be one winner and the loser is often dissatisfied. We all know that the unsuccessful litigant in a family matter appears to be frequently more dissatisfied than unsuccessful litigants in other areas. That is because of the sensitivity and the emotional nature of this jurisdiction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Generally, one is not arguing about some small claim or a piece of tin that is fashioned into a car that has been smashed up; one is arguing about the dissolution of one's family, the custody of children, dissolution of property and the ending of what presumably was at one stage a successful marriage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation is, as far as I am informed, that in South Australia the administration of the court is being hampered by its inadequate housing. I want to put to Senator Tate a number of matters that have been put to me and ask him to respond on behalf of the Government as to why it is that the Family Court in South Australia has to stay in its currently inadequate housing. As I understand it, there have been numerous incidents over the life of the court and this would not be, I am sure, particular to South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently, there have been a number of incidents. As I understand it, late last year Justice McGovern was proceeding towards a stairwell and was chased by a man with a bag of syringes. As I further understand it, the man previously identified himself as being a diabetic. That is why he had the syringes; let me say that from the very beginning. I do not want to create the impression that some more hazardous position eventuated than otherwise was the case. Nonetheless, it does highlight what could happen.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I understand it, Justice McGovern made it to the stairwell quite safely in the company of an officer who was accompanying him back to his chambers; so everybody can breathe a sigh of relief and say that nothing happened. But, of course, there is possibly a disaster waiting to happen and there is a situation in which members of the judiciary, the staff who are meant to look after them and, for that matter, the litigants and the members of the legal profession advising the litigants do not feel safe.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have tried to commence by highlighting that I understand that this jurisdiction by its very nature is a very sensitive and emotional one. But that is the very reason that it has to be adequately housed. It could have been someone with a syringe tainted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome contaminated blood who was chasing Justice McGovern. As I say, it was not, but it highlights the situation where it could be the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was another incident where a man entered from the back of one of the courts in Adelaide. His demeanour was such that the presiding judge had to adjourn the hearing and disappear into the anteroom. Of course, what the judge discovered when he or she got there was that there was nowhere to go. Had the man who had entered the courtroom yelling and screaming wanted to do more damage than he did, he could have. Had the man had a gun he could have done even more damage. In fact, I am informed that the person, on leaving the courtroom, muttered to somebody that he could have shot the judge if he wanted to.
       </para>
       <para>
        One is left wondering how the judge must have felt when, having adjourned proceedings and moved off into an anteroom at the side of the court, he discovered the anteroom had no exit. So a judge could be in a position where a lunatic came into a court-not necessarily an unsuccessful litigant, but just a lunatic-armed in some way and the judge had nowhere to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I understand it, in South Australia the members of the judiciary have to use a public stairwell off which public toilets run. This is not to say that the judiciary is composed of a level of people who need not mix with the public, but we are aware of the security that should be afforded to judges in this jurisdiction because of its sensitive and emotional character. It appears that that kind of security is not being offered to them in Adelaide.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, I understand that the profession is very concerned about the inadequacy of the waiting areas on level six. There are two courtrooms on that floor. The three waiting areas are not properly closed off; they are semi-open waiting areas. Litigants need to hang around here and discuss their matters, with the opposing parties not necessarily out of earshot. It is in this area that counsel need to take advice and there is only one small counsel room where they can go to prepare draft orders and matters of that sort. So frequently that sort of work is going on in this public area as well. It is through this public area that the people presiding in those two courts have to proceed to get back to their chambers and/or offices. As I understand it, it is in this area in July that one litigant chose to stab his wife not long after the judge had left that area. We all know what stabbing means. It means taking a sharp instrument and thrusting it into someone else's body.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can say we are thankful that the judge had left the area, but we should not be any less displeased that the litigant managed to stab his wife. When members of the judiciary, or perhaps members of the legal profession, have nowhere to go in this melting pot of a jurisdiction and are all put together on the sixth floor, we have to expect trouble. It is a disaster waiting to happen. The litigant could have come out and stabbed the judge.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a very worrying situation in Adelaide. I am informed that the staff of the Family Court in Adelaide is operating under considerable stress. People do not like to work unless there are glass shields between them and members of the public. It is sad that we have come to this, but if people are working in the administration of the Family Court and someone takes a swipe at them over the counter, as happened recently in Adelaide, then we can understand people saying that they do not want to work there unless there is some protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a very serious matter. It is not just a question of protecting the judiciary. It is not just a question of providing a suitable forum for litigants in this jurisdiction to have their matters heard. There are costs for the Commonwealth. Heaven knows what the costs for Comcare would be of stress related claims in this area or what the costs for the Commonwealth would be were someone-an unsuccessful litigant or a lunatic-to stab successfully a member of staff of the Commonwealth Public Service.
       </para>
       <para>
        If these sorts of things happened in a Supreme Court there would be an uproar, with headlines in the Australian: `Man stabbed in Supreme Court'. But because it is the Family Court-dare I suggest partly because it is the Family Court in Adelaide and therefore not so politically important as Family courts in the eastern States, where there are more seats to be won-nothing is done. If it happened in the Supreme Court the headlines would read, `Judge chased by man with bag of syringes in hand' and `Person stabbed in Supreme Court just after a judge has passed through the area'. It would be regarded as totally unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put to the Minister that this is totally unacceptable for the Family Court. It is just as unacceptable, if not more so, as it would be if it happened in another court. The profession in South Australia has been led to believe for some time that this matter would be attended to, that the Family Court would be rehoused in more suitable buildings where members of the profession could feel safe, where members of the Public Service could feel safe, where the judiciary could feel safe and where litigants could feel safe.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I put to the Minister that we have a situation in Adelaide where the Family Court is clearly inadequately housed. We have a situation where judges can be chased up stairwells by men with bags of syringes. We have a situation where judges and the profession and the litigants have to mix together in a melting pot of an area where not so recently a litigant stabbed his wife. We have had people taking swipes at counter staff. It is a disaster waiting to happen. I would like to know what the Commonwealth is going to do about it.

         â€”Senator Vanstone has raised some points about the physical security of those who are on the bench performing their functions as officers of the court in various guises and those who seek the assistance of the court. All those people deserve the greatest possible personal security in an environment which, as she quite rightly said, is charged with emotion. We know this only too well from the tragic and very unAustralian series of bombings of registries in New South Wales Family Court buildings and attacks on judges, leading to the fatal bombing of Mr Justice Watson's home in Sydney which tragically killed his wife.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We know that people can become violent and, having harboured their grievance, break out in a form which takes as a focus for that violence an officer of the court or perhaps the judge who was concerned in their particular case. For that reason, the Australian Federal Police, and in a narrower role the Australian Protective Service, have a particular function in relation to the security of Family Courts. I will certainly undertake to check with the Australian Federal Police on the incidents which have given rise to Senator Vanstone's concern to try to ensure that, even within the current environment, steps are taken to provide the necessary personal security which she quite rightly says must be a feature of any court, not only in consideration of the personal safety of those involved but also if the system of justice and people's access and confidence to it is to remain as it ought to be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Vanstone uses those incidents as part of an argument to try to get the housing of the Family Court in Adelaide somewhat higher up the list than it is now in regard to other Family Court projects around Australia. By the way, these projects are normally part of a larger Federal Court complex project, so there are other courts involved. Their requirements also have to be taken into account in the planning and priority of the provision of court buildings for judges exercising Federal jurisdiction of various kinds, the Family Court being only one.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Vanstone has brought to the attention of the Senate particular characteristics of the building which in my estimation, just listening to her, would need immediate modification anyway in order to secure the safety of exit of the judge in the particular instance she outlined. I think that ought to be looked at quite apart from the question of the impact of her description of the situation on the ranking of the Adelaide Federal Court project alongside other projects around Australia. We will look at the immediate situation and take it into account in any reassessment of the ranking.

         â€”I thank the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs for the manner in which he has responded. I used examples-they are just a few from the last 18 months-of what I think are very serious risks undertaken, as the Minister rightly pointed out, by all the people participating in this jurisdiction, not just the judiciary but the legal profession, the litigants and the staff of the courts as well. Their safety is important.

       <para>
        I appreciate what the Minister said about the Family Court being a part of the larger Federal system and therefore in terms of rehousing is considered along with other courts. But it is not like other courts in the sense of its sensitive and emotional nature and needs to be given some higher priority because of that. Since the Minister has undertaken to look at the existing housing in respect of the exit of judges particularly, is that an undertaking to look at the existing housing in terms of the safety of everybody involved? For example, as he probably well knows, the Family Court is currently housed in a public building. It is not separately partitioned off so it is probably difficult to maintain decent security over who comes in and out and whether they bring weapons with them or whatever. The safety of counter staff is important and, for that matter, the safety of the legal profession and the litigants. Is the adequacy of the waiting rooms off the counselling area and off level 6 something the Minister is prepared to look at as well?

I would say that the Minister's solicitors should ask for instructions as to why the appeal should proceed and perhaps give advice to the fact that it should not. The Department was ordered to pay interest to Mr Milton on his superannuation because it was late-I think by 13 days-in paying him his money. As I said before, I have no doubt that, if any private company did that and did not pay the penalty, all of us would feel it was a grave error of judgment not to do so.

        In other words, if the committee seeks to receive advice which is absolutely secure, confidential and exclusive to it, and it makes that clear to the Attorney when it seeks some assistance in a matter of statutory interpretation or legal advice, then the Attorney will take that into account because of all those sorts of factors as to the proper administration of his Department and its agencies and the statutes under which they conduct their business.

         â€”Thank you. I appreciate the Attorney-General's outline of the future practice in that respect but, as I see it, that puts the parliamentary committee in the position that it has to disclose its hand to the Minister first off. The Attorney has to consider what advice the committee wants and weigh that up against the potential conflicts of interest and other matters. The Attorney cannot do that unless the committee discloses its hand and says what advice it wants. Irrespective of whether the committee then proceeds to get advice from the Attorney or goes to some private counsel, having disclosed its hand to the Attorney, it may well have disclosed its hand to all and sundry in the Attorney-General's Department. Is the request to be kept confidential? Could the committee know that at least?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Just suppose the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority wanted some confidential advice on the conduct of a member of the Authority or a member of the staff of the Authority. The committee certainly would not distrust the advice that it would get from the Attorney but it may not want to disclose to the Authority, any member of the Authority, or to a staff member of the Authority that it was seeking such advice. According to this outline, the Committee obviously has to tell the Attorney what it wants advice on so that he can weigh up these matters. What if he weighs it up so that the balance is not in favour of giving the Committee advice? Does the Attorney then feel free to go back and relate the seeking of advice and the nature of the advice sought to the other parties involved because of his responsibility to them? I do not mean he would do that to try to dip the Committee into it but because of the responsibility he holds.

         â€”It is, I suppose, a little difficult to forecast every situation, but in the situation put by Senator Vanstone-the example she gave of seeking advice about the proper interpretation of the National Crime Authority Act, for example-then quite clearly the Attorney-General would need to seek some advice from his own Department as to the possible conflicts of interest and difficulties if he did not make that advice more generally available to affected agencies. He would take departmental advice. I am sure it would be at the very highest level and would not involve, for example, in that case, the National Crime Authority. It would be the Attorney-General taking the advice of his most senior departmental officers, no doubt in conjunction with his own political judgment. They would be the sorts of matters he would take into account. I cannot say that he would deal with it personally without taking some advice from his senior departmental officers.

Does not the unexpected haste with which the Pakistan Government has effected delivery suggest that the value of the aircraft, in terms of military capability, is much greater than the Government has been prepared to admit and is therefore a legitimate cause of concern to the Indian Government? Bearing in mind the recent suspension of United States arms sales to Pakistan because of concerns about its nuclear capacity, does the Minister continue to maintain that India's concerns about regional stability are unfounded?

       <para>
        What Senator Schacht has done is focus on yet another feature of the wage-tax trade-off. That feature is that low and middle income earners, by virtue of the mathematical calculation of the tax scales, will be better off under the trade-off than they would have been had they taken the increase as a wage increase and not as a tax reduction. The Government welcomes that more equitable dimension in the trade-off terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me give to the Senate three very quick examples of what I mean. Taking wages at the levels of $21,000, $25,000 and $30,000 a year, I can demonstrate why middle and low income earners are better off under the trade-off by using wage equivalent terms. At $21,000 a year, the wage value of the 0.7 per cent September quarter increase would be $2.80. Under the trade-off the wage equivalent would be $4.85; that is, $2 a week more. Then adding the wage equivalent of the tax cuts already foreshadowed in the Budget, plus these new tax cuts, the wage equivalent for that level of income would be $15.20 a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the $25,000 mark, the wage increase would be worth $3.40 under the 0.7 per cent adjustment. Under the tax cut it is worth $4.85, an extra $1.45 per week. The total wage value of both tax cuts is $16.45 at that wage level. Under the $30,000 mark, the wage increase at the 0.7 per cent indexation rate would be $4.20. The wage equivalent under the tax cut is $4.85; that is, an extra 65c a week. The joint tax cuts are worth $18.05 in equivalent wage terms at that level.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has to be said about this is that no employer under this trade-off will be paying the equivalent wage level. All employers under this trade-off will save those costs to their business and thus have effectively a wage holiday for 12 months.

        In answering the question in a general sense at this stage, I ask the Senate to note that what is going on in Comcar is a major review of the organisation, its functions and its direction. The redundancy packages that have been organised in respect of Comcar are very much part of that fundamental change of direction of the organisation. Having said that, I reiterate that I will provide full answers to the four specific questions that Senator Parer has asked, possibly by the end of Question Time but certainly later this week.

         â€”I have indeed seen reports indicating that the Western Australian Government will grant 150 hectares of crown land to the University of Notre Dame Australia. The first point I make is that we should appreciate that decisions about the establishment of private institutions are very much matters for State government. The Commonwealth does not have legislative power in this area. Nevertheless, we have been asked for an expression of attitude and the Federal Government is surprised at this extraordinarily generous public subvention to a private institution.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Our position, in line with Australian Labor Party policy, is that private institutions would not be granted direct or indirect financial assistance for development purposes. Any decision such as the one that Senator Beahan asked about by the Western Australian Government to support the University of Notre Dame Australia would no doubt reflect the priorities of that Government and the benefits that it perceives as flowing to Western Australia from the proposed development. However, the move is somewhat curious considering the often called for need by public institutions in Western Australia-such as the University of Western Australia , the Murdoch University, the Curtin University of Technology and the Western Australian College of Advanced Education-for more resources. Indeed, the decision to grant land to a private institution such as Notre Dame is even more odd when the public institutions in Western Australia are not granted the same privilege.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our main concern in this field is for public institutions and for the public system of higher education. If the Western Australian Government held similar concern for the public system it would have considered a more even-handed approach to this matter or, indeed, it would revisit this decision altogether.

         â€”I am aware of the latest Amnesty report and I share the concern of the Papua New Guinea Government about the contents of it. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and I have raised the issue with the PNG Government on a number of occasions and at the highest levels, emphasising the need for investigations and appropriate disciplinary action to be taken against those responsible. In September, for example, the Prime Minister during his visit discussed our concerns with Prime Minister Namaliu and senior Ministers.
        </para>

       <para>
        The PNG Government has acknow- ledged that abuses have occurred on Bougainville, committed by both the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) and some members of the security forces. The PNG Parliament, through the Berghuser Committee, also investigated allegations of human rights abuses on Bougainville. The PNG Government has itself undertaken a number of investigations but there are difficulties in pursuing a number of those allegations because of the continuation of the situation on Bougainville.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, 67 cases have been listed before the National Court in Rabaul and are being handled by the Public Solicitor's Office. The preliminary hearing in this respect was held on 12 October. The PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) at that hearing gave an undertaking that relevant documents would be released. A new date for hearing has been left open for the Public Prosecutor's Office to bring on cases as and when the various complainants come forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also the case that during the Endeavour talks, the PNG Government proposed the involvement of an International Committee of Jurists group to assist investigations into human rights abuses by both sides but the BRA did not agree to that. I understand that there were some reports this morning that a similar offer was repeated by the PNG Government yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        In cooperation with PNG's own efforts and in response to PNG's request for assistance, Australia has initiated a program to improve the effectiveness of Papua New Guinea's security forces. A $19m advisory and training assistance program to the PNG Police Force has already been in operation since 1988. As one of its objectives, Australian advisers are assisting PNG trainers with courses which include lectures on the role of police within the Constitution; the rights of citizens; and the use of minimum force to achieve objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        An important element in the training program carried out by the Australian defence forces for new recruits to the Papua New Guinea defence forces is to improve discipline and leadership and to create an environment in which respect for human rights is upheld. It is also the case that, in response to the PNG Government's concerns, the International Committee of the Red Cross recently conducted training or awareness courses on international human rights conventions for the PNGDF.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Amnesty report acknowledges, the PNG Constitution does contain strong guarantees for the protection and promotion of human rights. I think, Mr President, summing all that up, the best guarantee we do have is the commitment, which undoubtedly still exists so far as the Prime Minister and senior Ministers are concerned, to respond in an appropriate way to these problems of human rights abuse whenever and wherever they do occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are obviously going to be difficulties in tracking down and dealing with all of them, particularly in the circumstances that continue to exist on Bougainville. But we in the Australian Government believe the commitment is there and in a number of ways that I have already indicated we are doing our best to help the Papua New Guinea Government respond to the situation that has been spelt out.

As a consequence, an inquiry is being conducted into the industry by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Nothing in the preface to Senator Crane's question is at all surprising. Why he then equates the fact that a claim should be made with promoting industrial disputation is quite surprising because claims are made every day of the week. The purpose of making claims is to create a dispute at law so the matter can be dealt with by the arbitration Commission. If the Commission chooses, in whatever circumstances, to deal with it, that is the right of the Commission. Unlike Senator Crane's Party when it was in government, this Government will not stand over and interfere with the Commission, nor will we dictate to the Commission as to its rights. This Government believes the Commission is properly placed to make a judgment on each case that comes before it based on the merits of the case and the substantial arguments of the parties. Therefore, without trying to indicate to the Commission, I think it is appropriate that the Commission should deal with it. As I said yesterday, if there is a public interest dimension in this case, we will make an appearance and present the public interest in that case when it occurs.

        Let me come to the point of the question. I am not aware of what Mr Howe said at the conference to which the honourable senator referred, but it is not my recollection that the introduction of negative gearing was designed to deal with the problems of low cost housing. I thought that was essentially the function of public housing policy, and that the introduction of negative gearing was certainly because, as it has been put by the Treasurer since, as a matter of principle interest deductions should be permitted against income from any source as it is in the primary industry sector and in other sectors of the economy. Whether anything was said about the benefits which would flow to low cost rental accommodation from the introduction of negative gearing at the time, I do not recall. I will certainly try to obtain a more detailed answer from the Treasurer and provide it to the honourable senator as soon as possible.

Ltd shares from Bell Resources Ltd and that subsequently in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, on 18 November 1987, Premier Brian Burke denied that he had approved the borrowings and therefore grossly misled the Parliament and the people of Western Australia? Furthermore, is the Minister aware of conflicting evidence provided to the McCusker inquiry into Rothwells Ltd by the Ambassador to Ireland, Brian Burke, and former Rothwells director, John Hilton, about whether a meeting between Laurie Connell, Hilton and Burke to discuss the Rothwells rescue took place in May 1988, some six months after the announcement of Mr Burke's ambassadorial posting? Has the Minister investigated the propriety of the Ambassador in these matters; if not, will he? Finally, is it appropriate that Mr Burke remain in an ambassadorial position whilst these disturbing issues remain unresolved?

In answer to the last question, it is a sad fact that conservative political leaders in this country seem to think that they gain political points by attacking trade unions or by intervening in industrial relations in a disruptive way. The history of the Bjelke-Petersen, Ahern and Cooper governments is one recent example; in New South Wales the Greiner Government is embarking on that course; and it would seem that Mr Alan Brown in Victoria has chosen that course as well. They certainly ignore history. We were elected in 1983 on bringing Australia together and not setting Australians against Australians. We have brought Australia together significantly in terms of industrial relations.

        Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) industrial disputes series, catalogue No. 6321.0, I have compiled a table of industrial disputation in the States of Australia, which makes interesting reading. During the Fraser Government years, from 1976 to 1982, Victoria had the highest rate of industrial disputation of any Australian State-an annual average of 689 days lost per 1,000 employees. The Australian average annual rate was 589 per 1,000 during the Fraser years.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the Hawke Labor Government years, from 1983 to July 1990, the overall annual average rate of industrial disputation in Australia has dropped by 62 per cent to 224 working days lost per 1,000 employees. Industrial disputation in Victoria has fallen by the highest amount of any Australian State: it has dropped by 72 per cent to 193 working days lost per 1,000 employees, and is now below the Australian average. I point out for interest's sake that New South Wales has fallen by 55.4 per cent which is, in fact, a reduction that is trailing the field and is above the average annual reduction achieved throughout Australia.

        For the record of the Parliament, I table the ABS series and the computations made to arrive at the figures that I have, Quite clearly, this demonstrates what all Australians, as respondents to surveys of opinion, know and say: that Labor governments handle industrial relations better; that Labor governments have a more realistic understanding of how to bring harmony to the working place and how industrial relations work; and that by not embarking on confrontationist, interventionist-type proposals of the sort that the Opposition Leader in Victoria is proposing, Labor governments are able to succeed at reducing the level of industrial disputes to the benefit of the productivity per person employed in this country and to the benefit of a reduction in real unit labour costs-a reduction achieved during the period of this Government but not during the period of the former Government.

If this document were true, then nothing at all was spent on retooling. Yet there is no question that some retooling did occur. I therefore cannot explain the discrepancy between the fact that retooling occurred and this document claiming that no money at all was spent on it. As Senator O'Chee would recall, the agreement with the mill at Ravenshoe provided for it to do more than just retool. It provided for it to be able to make up operating losses and to maintain employment at a particular number. So it was never suggested that every penny would be spent on retooling.

        Our monitoring and meetings suggested that retooling had occurred.

I will have to try to get an explanation for it and hopefully provide it to the honourable senator tomorrow.

I must say, for the benefit of the residents of Queensland, if not for Senator Hill, that the facts are that the chief agent for this company in Australia has categorically denied this story. Mr Dunning, in fact, has been spoken to at some length by people in my office. They have advised that the company has in fact not washed its hands of the project for Townsville. They are still keen to go ahead with the aircraft maintenance facility in the city.

        The original story did give the reader the clear impression that Denbridge had chosen, that is, had made a decision, to site the facility in Mexico instead of Townsville. This is not and, according to Mr Dunning, has never been the case. In those terms, the story is totally inaccurate. Townsville is in fact one of four sites where aircraft maintenance facilities are being considered by this company. The other sites are Mexico, Dubai-which is looking rather doubtful at the moment-and Hungary. Townsville is still being considered as the Asian base for maintenance for this company.

        Mr Dunning has told my office that he is keen to get the project moving.

         â€” I thank Senator Crichton-Browne. Listening all these years, he will gradually learn. The fact of the matter is that MFP Adelaide could well enhance efforts to create a world leading management industry. Environmental management is one of the five key industries upon which the proposal is based. With environmental issues becoming of increasing concern both in Australia and globally, this area will be important to the MFP in terms of the opportunities offered by the Gillman site to research, develop, teach and demonstrate the skills and techniques of environmental renewal and responsible management. I make the point that these things have been done with sites like this in other countries and the technology is available.

        Secondly, it involves the possibility of capturing the opportunities offered by the large and growing world market for environmental management services, tech- nology and education. The MFP could indeed have the potential to influence environmental management on a world scale, and a world environmental management centre is envisaged as one of the key proposals for the MFP. Initiatives are already progressing in South Australia in environmental research and teaching activities, including the proposal by the Flinders University to establish a new centre for sustainable development.

I again make the point that the Commonwealth and South Australian governments have said that there will be no final decision on the MFP unless it can be clearly shown that it is in Australia's best economic interests and is environmentally sustainable.

The Minister will be aware that the Hawke Government, during its term of office, has granted nearly $9m to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to administer for foreign aid purposes. Does the ACTU receive a management fee, contribution towards staff costs, or other form of compensation to administer these grants?

        APHEDA has a reputation of being one of Australia's most effective and efficient non-government aid organisations. That is really all I need to say. I will see whether there is any more information that I can dig up about the specific consultancy fees and so on which the honourable senator mentioned. But the short answer is that they are entirely consistent with the normal principles that apply to NGOs of that kind.

        There is a donor coordination meeting being organised by the ANC for early 1990-91. The ANC organised a preliminary planning meeting, together with the Mass Democratic Movement and trade union representatives from within South Africa, to set priorities and to develop proposals for presentation at that donor coordination meeting. It sought APHEDA funding for the planning meeting and, in turn, APHEDA approached the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. The Government was pleased to meet the APHEDA request, given the important role of these bodies in bringing about change and in establishing and setting new development priorities.

         â€”I am happy to inform Senator Sherry that there is no undue invasion of privacy occasioned by this particular Act and its implementation from time to time. Indeed, the Attorney-General announced yesterday that the provisions of the Act requiring cash dealers to verify the identity of new signatories to accounts will come into force on 1 February 1991. This will apply to banks and other financial institutions such as building societies, credit unions, TABs and casinos.
        </para>

       <para>
        Parliament has already decided, in formulating the Act itself, on the balance to be struck between the legitimate privacy interests of individuals and the other legitimate interests of society, and particularly following the money trail, in order to secure the apprehension and conviction of those involved in organised crime, but particularly drug trafficking. That balance is a very delicate one but I believe it has been struck well in the legislation and in the various regulations now being put in place to implement it fully.

        I well remember that when Mr Frank Costigan QC made his great report on the painters and dockers he pointed to many instances where suburban bank managers were virtually acting as accomplices and collaborators with organised crime groups in that they were not checking on obviously fictitious names used for the opening of accounts.

         â€”Senator Alston says that we have done nothing in relation to that, which is completely and utterly ridiculous because the Cash Transaction Reports Act was passed-Senator Alston may have been asleep-and came into effect on 1 July 1988. To operate an account in a false name has been, as I say, an offence for some 2 1/2 years. But, no doubt, he would not have quite grasped that. These measures were a very important response by the Parliament to the Costigan report in relation to the opening of accounts in false names. I believe that, if we are to combat money laundering through financial institutions, this par- ticular Act and its implementation will become increasingly important.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As I say, the Act is being implemented in a piecemeal fashion. We have now reached the stage whereby on 1 February 1991 these various financial institutions will be required to verify the identity of those who open accounts with them or who are signatories to business transactions with them. There will be several methods of carrying out that verification of identity.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to note that the records of that verification process will be held by the bank, credit union, the TAB agency or the building society and will not be made available to law enforcement agencies as a matter of course. They will be available only under the normal methods of search warrants and so on. That is to be distinguished from the usual pattern of activity by the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, whereby suspect transactions, those involving cash dealings of $10,000 or more, are automatically reported to the Agency and, of course, form the basis for some very effective investigative work by law enforcement agencies around Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that Mr Costigan's hopes in this regard have been fulfilled in a way which provides a proper recognition of the privacy concerns of individuals who open accounts or do business with these financial institutions. I believe that it goes a very long way towards helping Australia combat organised crime.

It has provided me with the following information which, in fact, arrived just this morning. The answer to the first part of Senator Crichton-Browne's question is no. The interception of telephone calls is regulated in Australia by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The Act makes it unlawful for any person to intercept telephone calls without the knowledge of the person making the communication, except where it is done by an officer of Telecom in the execution of his or her duties in certain specific circumstances or under a warrant issued under the Act.

        With respect to the second part of the question, in early 1989 Telecom investigatory staff in Western Australia incorrectly arranged for call charge analysis equipment-that is, CCAS equipment-to be placed on the services of some employees whose compensation cases were under review. CCAS equipment does not record details of conversations, but records the number dialled, the date and the duration of the calls. The error was detected and the matter was referred to the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.

        In relation to that last piece of advice, and perhaps to avoid the necessity for Senator Crichton-Browne to ask a supplementary question, I have asked Telecom to provide me with further advice as to what the results of that referral to the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions were.

         â€”Of course the honourable senator may have a copy; he will just have to be mildly patient. On the third question, Senator McMullan was conveying the results of discussions between the practitioner representatives and the Commissioner of Taxation whose administration is the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility. As to the fourth question, sound administration obviously requires the application of commonsense. Unyielding inflexibility regardless of the circumstances of the case would be totally unacceptable to the Australian public, and would bring the wheels of government to a grinding halt. That is not to say that the Government is ignoring the debate over the proper balance of the substantiation provisions. Senator McMullan said during the debate in the Senate on the subject of this question and answer:

        There are other possibilities under consideration. The current view of the Government-and I think it is the absolutely correct one, on the balance of evidence-is that the Opposition's discretion measure is not the appropriate answer, certainly not as a one-off exercise like this . . . it does not go to all the questions that may arise as to the appropriate role of substantiation in the overall scheme of the legislation, the broader issues relating to substantiation rules, and it may be that when we look at those this discretion is entirely inappropriate.

        - the production techniques are analogous to those employed by the computer industry and the company argues that, to develop a commercially viable product, it was necessary to undertake on-going development of the technology in a region of the world with ready access to this infrastructure

       <para>
        There has been a clear misinterpretation of the message I delivered to the ACROD Convention in Sydney last week. There are no cuts proposed to the funding of sheltered workshops and there is no intention on the Government's part to arbitrarily close any service that is needed by people with disabilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated at the ACROD Convention the Government is committed to getting a better deal for people with disabilities, ensuring they have the same rights and opportunities as any other Australian-which is totally consistent with this Government's social justice strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is seeking co-operative and evolutionary change within sheltered workshops. This change is wanted by people with disabilities and their families because of the significant positive outcomes such change can provide. In fact, a key element of the Disability Services Act is the provision of necessary ongoing support to provide people with more severe levels of disability with the opportunity to participate in real work for real pay and also to make a meaningful contribution to society.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I did acknowledge that there are concerns about making change, particularly in the transition of sheltered workshops to employment approaches which are eligible under the Disability Services Act.

       <para>
        My approach to assisting sheltered workshops overcome these concerns includes:
       </para>

        - the Government's commitment of unprecedented funding levels to enable new options and better opportunities to be provided;

I have subsequently checked the terms of my correspondence with the Presiding Officers on this matter and they confirm the accuracy of my answer. Originally there was a letter of 5 October from Dr Blewett, as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, informing the Presiding Officers that at that stage the Australian Government had no objections to planning for the parliamentary delegation's visit to Pakistan proceeding. But the point was made that in the light of uncertainty about the election and the electoral process that advice may need to be revised.

        I wrote again on or about 1 November to the Presiding Officers saying that, on the basis of information available to us at that stage, I did not have any objections to the visiting proceeding as planned. So any changes that were made to the visit arrangements would have been as a result of further consideration by the Presiding Officers based on budgetary and other relevant considerations. They had nothing to do with any policy prescription being stated by the Government. So all those breathless oohs and aahs that accompanied my answer previously were entirely misplaced.

The seamail Christmas card concession rate, which applied previously, was withdrawn because of significant losses incurred in the service. In addition, it is much more difficult to manage sea carriage to meet specific delivery standards. To offset the abolition of this concession, Australia Post has introduced an economy air concession which, for cards weighing up to 20 grams, will enable Australia Post customers to send their greeting cards by air at a cheaper rate than by seamail. In addition, sending their cards by economy air will enable a more reliable standard of service.

      <para>
       I thank the Minister for Social Security most sincerely. I have moved this motion because information has come to hand which confirms my earlier fears that there has been a substantial misappropriation at the Ravenshoe sawmill in north Queensland. In October I tabled financial statements relating to Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd and other associated companies which suggested that in excess of $5m may have been misappropriated from the sawmill in Ravenshoe. I was concerned about the possible misappropriation because it appeared, and now transpires, that it occurred under the Government's very nose. In response to my original allegations Senator Richardson stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . up until the time the Company went into receivership it had met the conditions placed upon it by the Commonwealth. I am advised that there was, therefore, no need to take any action until then and no reason for us to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       I subsequently tabled in the Senate evidence to show that between $5.3m and $5.7m had been syphoned out of Ravenshoe, apparently for the purpose of building a sawmill in Kyogle. The money of course should have stayed in Ravenshoe. That was the intention and that was why the money was made available by the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have now tabled documents which, I understand, were prepared from accounts of the Ravenshoe mill and which confirm my earlier suspicions and in fact go much further. Almost $7.6m of Commonwealth funds was made available to the mill. At most, only $3.8m, as identified in the tabled documents, was spent either directly or indirectly on the retooling of the mill. A sum of $1.2m of this came out of the company's own working capital. This means that only $2.6m of the $7.6m made available by the Commonwealth was used in the retooling of the mill.
      </para>

       The documents in my possession also indicate that there was a substantial discrepancy in the funds transferred between the National Australia Bank Ltd in Ravenshoe and Westpac Banking Corporation in Sydney. The effect of this was that some $200,000 appears to have been syphoned out of the company's accounts in Ravenshoe.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also of concern to me is the transfer of $1.15m of veneer timber from Ravenshoe to associated companies which was never paid for. These transfers occurred mainly between October 1988 and August 1989. The failure of the Ravenshoe mill to receive payment for this timber was not a clerical oversight as it occurred over a protracted period. The accounts were unpaid for up to 18 months before the group went into receivership. As far as I can see, this is a case of asset stripping, pure and simple.
      </para>
      <para>
       According to the statement tabled by Senator Richardson on 16 October:
      </para>
      <para>
       Like any good business manager the Commonwealth did not let its loan go unwatched. Officers of the Department regularly telephoned the manager of the mill to seek information on progress with the retooling. The mill was visited by representatives on several occasions. The Department's financial advisers on this issue, Price Waterhouse, also monitored the operations of the mill.
      </para>
      <para>
       I cannot understand how $1.15m worth of timber could disappear from the mill and not be noticed. That it could occur is not surprising, however, given that the veneer mill was sold and that was not noted by the departmental officers. I am now able to show that the money for this veneer mill was received on 14 November 1989, a full five months before the company went into receivership. I can only assume that the machinery was sold about this time as the moneys were received but never noted by the departmental officers. As I said in October, this is clearly in breach of clause 2, subclause 1, paragraph 1 of the assistance agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       All this shows very clearly that the Ravenshoe sawmill was and remains a viable financial proposition. Its failure can be attributed to two things: the apparent rorts by the previous management and the Government's financial negligence. This also proves beyond doubt that the Government should and must do everything in its power to keep the mill going. On behalf of the people of Ravenshoe, I must say that I also believe that there is very good evidence that fraud may have occurred and that the Commonwealth's consultants, Price Waterhouse, may have been negligent in monitoring the operations of the mill.
      </para>

       I am continuing my investigations and look forward to frank and open cooperation by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, to right the wrongs that have occurred.

        The order which I am referring to of 28 September 1988 indicates that, if a question on notice has not been answered within 30 days, a senator may ask for an explanation if that has not been given, and that this may occur at the conclusion of Question Time on a day after that period. Then it indicates the other steps that a senator may take, either to take note of the answer or explanation or, if that is not satisfactory, to take such other steps as may be appropriate.

        Are there any Commonwealth or Commonwealth funded programs relating to interstate coach safety standards or monitoring? If so, what are the nature of these programs and the extent of Commonwealth funding?

        There may be a simple explanation as to why a question, which I thought was fairly straightforward, given on 8 May, has not been answered. Perhaps all I can do at this stage is give notice that, if it is not answered by this time tomorrow, I will raise it again. I will expect the Minister representing the Minister for Land Transport to remain for however long it takes to get to the point where it is appropriate to raise a matter of this nature, unless there is any other Minister present who is able to take the matter at this time.

But unfortunately, given the fact that the House of Representatives is not sitting, he has been unable in the short time since he was alerted to this matter at the end of Question Time to gather a response from the office of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). I am sure that as soon as he does so, he will be in a position to inform Senator Reid and the Senate. A request has been made by the Senate under a more formal Senate standing order that an answer be supplied. That will be done. But, as I said, there is an unfortunate hiatus in getting information from Mr Brown's office. As soon as that is done, I am sure Senator Collins will provide an answer.

       <para>
        I wish to congratulate the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on the presentation of another report and the expiration of another very fine year. It is very important to note a comment in the report in order to understand the significance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park-that is, that the Barrier Reef is a natural resource, the economic value of which is estimated to be $1,000m per annum and the ecological value of which is quite incalculable. It is a massive resource. It is one of the eight wonders of the world. It is something which attracts tourists to north Queensland from all over the world and it is something which, in general, north Queenslanders and Australians guard very jealously. It is a marvellous asset to this country and something of which we, as Australians, should be very proud.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Authority which manages the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is held in particularly high regard throughout the world. Its members are known for their competence, their expertise and their even-handedness in all their dealings. Among the projects the Authority looked at during the year in question was a matter which is very important to the Great Barrier Reef and to conservation and ecology generally-that is, the effect on the Great Barrier Reef of the run-off of nutrients from the land into the sea.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Authority notes with some satisfaction that a lot of work is being done, a lot of guidance is being given and advice is being sought through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Council. It also notes that the farming community of north Queensland is aware of the problem of nutrient run-off into the sea around the reef and is adding its weight to try to overcome it. The farming community is joining in projects and investigations to stop that soil erosion. It is doing so for two reasons: firstly, to save the Great Barrier Reef and, secondly, to lessen the rate of soil erosion and land degradation which occurs in some of the fragile lands of north Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also interesting to note from the report that over the past year the Authority has been charging for its investigations into development matters. I am particularly pleased to note that the Authority is undertaking a program to examine continually its procedures in order to maximise efficiency and to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy. This is indeed a worthwhile aim for a government agency. It is one which does not surprise me, because I know of the high standing in which the Authority is held. It is worth noting, and making an example of, the efforts to which the Authority has gone to make sure its methods are carried out in the most efficient way to reduce costs for the customers it serves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also want to mention briefly the enormous amount of work that the Authority does in trying to minimise the risk from oil spills on the reef and to minimise the dangers such a spill, should it ever tragically occur, would create. Hopefully, with all the work being put in by the Authority, such a thing will never happen. But if it does, the Authority is as well prepared as anyone ever could be to try to save the reef.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the Senate's attention to an appeal made by the Chairman of the Authority in his report regarding appeal procedures that the Authority is involved in. I ask the Government to look very seriously at that matter. A development was constructed at Magnetic Quay--

         â€”Unlike Senator Macdonald, I find that this is a cosy document in that problems are noted but not really addressed. For example, page 2 of the report states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Evidence continues to accumulate that the levels of nitrogen and phosphorous in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are causing damage to some coral communities . . .

       <para>
        . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The farming community itself is aware of the problem and changes are occurring already in farming practices which will have the effect of reducing the run-off of nutrients, as well as reducing the rate of soil erosion and land degradation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the view of the Australian Democrats that pollution from agricultural, industrial, mining and sewage effluents is being pumped into the reef system from many rivers and island resorts at dangerous levels. While I welcome the comments of the Queensland cane growers in particular, I think that there is a much more urgent need to modify land use practices now. We need to address the matter of the excessive use of fertilisers, soil erosion and run-off from the infamous Daintree road.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several times over the last few years the Democrats have attempted to introduce amendments to legislation in this place to protect the reef from mining. We have also attempted to introduce amendments to strengthen conservation procedures regarding the reef. The threats to the reef now really include intense pressure from commercial interests, such as tourism and fishing, which are not adequately screened off from the reef.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is presently an unsustainable level of fishing, both commercial and recreational. As there has been an upsurge in tourist numbers-an annual increase of 30 per cent, with about 1.5 million visitors in 1989-this means that such pressures will become greater. Therefore, we believe that zoning needs to be strengthened and tourist proposals need to be more carefully monitored.
       </para>
       <para>
        Page 15 of the report deals with zoning as perceived by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Whenever a zoning plan is about to be prepared, Reef users are invited to give their opinions on how zoning should be undertaken as well as providing information about their use of the Reef.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the problem as we see it: all of the emphasis is on the use of the reef. There seems to be little recognition of the fact that the reef, like our forests and our mountains, belongs to all Australians, not just the users and the exploiters. We should recognise the fact that the reef has a right simply to exist in its own right-it is an ecosystem which we have no right to destroy or degrade.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major threat to the reef comes from outside-from the Government's strategy of offshore oil exploration which would see drilling adjacent to the reef in the Townsville trough and the Maryborough basin, the Queensland trough and the Capricorn basin, where wind and currents would disastrously carry oil spill on to the reef, causing major ecological disaster.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the credit side is this week's announcement that the international maritime authorities have agreed to declare the reef a compulsory pilotage area. This was decided, obviously, after the printing of this document. However, I welcome this announcement, which will mean greater safety from oil spillage from marine accidents. I also note with pleasure the happy ending to the floating hotel saga whereby the monster has been removed without leaving any trace.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is doing a good job, probably the best it can under the circumstances, but I believe that policy needs to be hardened. We need to stop attempting to compromise with tourist and commercial pressures and, indeed, see the role of the Authority as custodian of this unique part of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it is unrealistic to ask any department to function to its optimum with inadequate funds. A constant refrain of this report can be found on page 23, where it is stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The year was characterised by pressure to deal with a heavy workload without sufficient resources.
       </para>

         â€”I would like to mention a few matters that have emerged out of this debate on the annual report of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I join with previous speakers in commending the Authority on not only the work it is doing but also the manner in which it is doing it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am concerned that the Australian Democrats have made the comment that there is a deficiency in the report in the sense that problems were noted but not really addressed. But I think one of the significant things about this report is that it is addressing the problems. On the question of nutrients, for example, I thought it would have been nice if the last speaker had acknowledged the fact that the Authority is now in a much better position to deal with this because, as the report says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Coordination of action in relation to nutrients, most of which are likely to originate from run-off from farm land on the mainland, will be made much easier through the new membership of the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council. Members now include the Ministers for the Environment and the Ministers responsible for Primary Industries in both the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments. It is these ministries which have the primary responsibilities relevant to research and management of land use on the mainland.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thought it would have been nice if the previous speaker had rounded off her quote and said that the report says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Such programs and changes will benefit not only the mainland, but the Great Barrier Reef as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that questions are being addressed. On the question of oil spills, for example, there is no doubt there is a significant addressing of that problem. While it is true that the Authority says that the various measures it is taking, and has taken, can reduce the risks of an oil spill and, in most circumstances, reduce the adverse environmental effects of a spill, it cannot eliminate them. That is quite true, but it is churlish not to acknowledge that the Authority is not only noting but is also addressing these problems. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A significant amount of oil is transported by ship in the shipping channels within the Great Barrier Reef.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Authority is developing a computer program which incorporates maps showing the location of environmentally sensitive areas and which predicts the movement of an oil spill relative to wind and tide conditions. This simple program, which runs on the popular Apple McIntosh microcomputer, has proven more effective than far more elaborate programs developed by other agencies around the world because its use requires almost no special training.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to state:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Authority has worked with a number of Commonwealth Government Departments towards the introduction of compulsory pilotage for all vessels . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I am glad to see it was acknowledged that, although the report says that about 90 per cent of the relevant vessels now using the Great Barrier Reef employ pilots on a voluntary basis, we are moving to 100 per cent despite the constraints under international law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point that Senator Macdonald was unable to complete about appeals procedures when developers wish to proceed with a development in the area is that the appeals system has been, I will not say abused, but has caused a great many problems in the past. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority strongly believes that the delays that are set up by people using the mechanisms almost ad absurdum are:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . unfair to the public, unfair to developers and to opponents of proposals and projects within the Great Barrier Marine Park. The matter has been taken up with the Commonwealth Government with the hope of achieving changes in the procedures relating to such appeals.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this indicates that this body, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, is acting in a sensible and coherent way to address the problems-and they are very real indeed-of threat to the reef from nutrients, oil spills or excessive development. I believe that this is one of those bodies that should be commended for its active and effective handling of the problems, and also its determination to do so in a sympathetic and sensitive way.

       The Australian film industry is facing a great deal of difficulty, not only because of repeated changes in government policy and international problems, but also because of the collapse of all of the major Australian television networks. I do not think that the Chairman of the Australian Film Commission necessarily does himself or his status much good by giving gratuitous insults to the people who en- gineered the collapse of the Australian commercial television industry. I think we can do without Mr Phillip Adams giving us the benefit of his advice, and I quote:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the once flourishing commercial networks which have fallen victim to corporate greed and stupidity.
      </para>
      <para>
       He says that the broadcasters have had to pay for the follies of new owners. The net result has been chaos, insolvency and an inability to play their traditional part as instigators of, or investors in, a proper level of local drama and documentary.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that the collapse of those entrepreneurs in the television industry has caused serious problems. I think it can be commented on without going over the top in the way Mr Phillip Adams, as Chairman of the Australian Film Commission, does in its annual report. Nonetheless, it is a serious problem, and it is particularly worrying when one recognises that there are some important Australian content targets that have been agreed to and that will in fact involve the Australian television industry in high levels of expenditure. Looking at the television industry at the moment, it is a matter of some concern where the money is going to come from. It is vital that there is sufficient funding for Australian productions. This industry was prospering at the time of the Fraser Government under the very enlightened ministry of Mr Bob Ellicott, but it is now facing a whole series of problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is unfortunate that Australians do not seem to be terribly keen to see Australian films. I notice that in the annual report it says that Australian features only had a 5 per cent share of capital city cinemas in Australia last year. It is also interesting to see that the number of Australian drama programs on Australian prime time television totalled 26 features last year, compared to 30 Australian drama programs on North American pay television last year. Apparently, American pay television channels are more interested in Australian features than Australian prime time television producers are.

       I believe the Australian Film Commission is doing a worthwhile job, although it is going through major changes in its activities and direction. It is now basically aimed less at involving itself in big Australian productions-which are now financed through the Australian Film Finance Corporation Pty Ltd-and more at providing opportunities for younger, less experienced people in the industry to get a performance opportunity. In this area the Australian Film Commission has apparently been having a reasonable level of success. I think that the challenges that the film industry face in the coming years will be facilitated if the Australian Film Commission can continue to provide the basic support that is required in this developing area of young Australian film-makers.

       I have glanced quickly through the Law Reform Commission report. As I did, it occurred to me that there are a lot of good people in the community who do a lot of good things. If one reads through report No. 54 of the Law Reform Commission, it becomes apparent what I mean. There is the Commission itself and there are the people on whom the Commission has been able to call over the years to help it do its work; and it is work which is vital.

       Doctors look after our life and health and are therefore to be given much kudos, but the people who make the law and see that it is enforced, and properly interpreted, also serve a noble purpose. They guard our rights; they look to see that our reputation is preserved as it should be; they facilitate the machinery of the law, which looks after those great aspirations of the human spirit-such as aspirations to liberty, to tolerance, to kindness, and to generosity-that we like to think are the marks of what is best in humankind. In doing those things, people connected with the law perform a very high duty in society.
      </para>
      <para>
       The law, like society itself, is an institution which is forever in flux. Society is forever changing and the law, which reflects that society, must change with it. In effect, that means that there will always be need for law reform. The way that reform is carried out is crucial to the sort of community we live in and to the sort of life we are able to pursue. In that context, the Law Reform Commission, to which governments of both colours have looked since it was set up in 1973, is a vital instrument through which good can be done to this society.

       It is always invidious, as has often been said, to mention names, but I do think it proper to mention the President of the Law Reform Commission, Justice Elizabeth Evatt, who has led a mighty team-mighty in the way it has suggested reform to the law; mighty in the way it has carried out its task; and mighty in the way it has expressed the things it has done with such clarity. She has been a great source of information to the Committee which I chair, that is, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and she has been an inspiration to that Committee. She is greatly assisted by the Secretary and Director of Research of the Commission, that is, Mr Stephen Mason. The Deputy President, Mr Greenwell, also deserves mention, as do the many people whose names appear in this report. If time were available I would certainly mention many of them, because they all deserve mention. As ever, time is on the wing and I am unable to do so. I simply sum up by saying that this is a great report.

        â€”The examination of laws against the background and framework of values that are held and necessary for a cohesive, happy society are very necessary within this country or any other country. The work of the Law Reform Commission over a number of years has been the subject of discussion in this chamber and elsewhere. Not infrequently, the discussion has focused on particular reports of the Law Reform Commission. This report, however, is the annual report of the Law Reform Commission and, as has been indicated, quite a range of people, not only on the Commission but also outside of it, have made contributions to the work of the Commission.

       I do, however, have one caveat-given the statements made by the previous speaker-in respect of Justice Elizabeth Evatt. It is important when Justice Elizabeth Evatt goes to particular locations and addresses organisations that the speeches she makes be made available to members of parliament and to any individual in the community who requests them. On 17 November, Justice Elizabeth Evatt, the President of the Law Reform Commission, addressed the conference dinner at the Abortion Providers Federation of Australia. A request has been made for a copy of her address, but that has not been forthcoming.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is very important that we know what is being said by people who are looking at law reform in Australia. The area of abortion is a matter of great tragedy in Australia. It is a matter of great human cost, and indeed financial cost, in Australia. It would be illuminating for members of parliament and members of the public to know what is being said by Justice Elizabeth Evatt, and particularly to know, from a perusal of that address, why she chose to accept an invitation from an organisation which has a vested interest in the abortion industry in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       With that caveat, I should like to concur with what has been said about the work that is being done by a large number of people to run the rule over the laws of this country and to respond to some of the difficult references that are frequently being made by governments of all colours.

         â€”I thank Senator Crichton-Browne for his indication that the Opposition parties-and from what has been said in informal conversations with Senator Spindler, I have no doubt the Australian Democrats also-support very strongly the appointment of Mr Justice Phillips as Chairman of the National Crime Authority and the new direction in which he is taking the investigative work of that Authority, which, of course, is charged with assembling admissible evidence, using extraordinary powers, over a whole range of serious organised criminal activity in this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Justice Phillips has indicated that there will be a shift in emphasis from drug trafficking questions-though not, of course, abandoning inquiries where appropriate-to the investigation of white collar crime as an important facet of its work. Of course, money laundering is the bridge between the two. We know that great volumes of money are generated from drug trafficking and find their way into apparently legitimate businesses. In that way, there is an attempt to shield from investigative agencies the true origin in criminal activity of substantial amounts of money which are to be found in our commercial and trading enterprises and life. I am very pleased to have received that assurance from Senator CrichtonBrowne, on behalf of the Opposition. I am sure that it will be of great comfort to Justice Phillips as he undertakes his task.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that context, it is not so much that the Government has a view as to the appropriateness of the parliamentary Joint Committee undertaking earlier than it originally envisaged its review of the overall operation of the National Crime Authority. As I understand it, the parliamentary Joint Committee is entitled to undertake such a review, given its statutory terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        The intergovernmental committee is composed not simply of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia but of Attorneys-General and Ministers for police from all jurisdictions. It receives very strong support from Mr Ted Pickering, representing the Government of New South Wales, Mr Marshall Perron, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and Mr Bernard Collaery, who was invited to attend as an observer at the recent meeting in Alice Springs. The committee is made up of people from all jurisdictions. I merely mention those people to show that it is a bipartisan matter. They have indicated that they believe it would be better and more conducive if this new direction envisaged and captained by Mr Justice Phillips be allowed to develop without the distraction of raking over dying embers of past difficulties which did exist and for which a remedy was needed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In so far as many of those difficulties had to do, for example, with the question of some jealousy, the protection of turf and a perceived lack of cooperation and collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, they have been addressed head on by Mr Justice Phillips. He has indicated a new collaborative and cooperative approach which has the support of all Ministers from all jurisdictions together with their commissioners of police and, I am sure, other Federal Government agencies, such as the Cash Transaction Reports Agency.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as matters of morale within the organisation are concerned, I believe very strongly that those working within the organisation, under the leadership of Mr Justice Phillips, ably aided by Mr Julian Leckie and Mr Greg Cusack, QC, and knowing that all governments are fully supportive of the new directions and of the new leadership, will have had a tremendous boost to their morale and will be anxious to get on with the job, newly defined as it is.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was in that context that the inter-governmental committee made a suggestion to the parliamentary Committee that it might hold its review at the original time that was intended rather than having it brought forward, as is apparently the case at the moment. So it is not so much a government directive, if one likes, as a matter for the Commonwealth Attorney-General, as chairman of the intergovernmental committee and on behalf of the Committee, writing to the parliamentary Joint Committee in those terms.

        Much of what the honourable senator says, of course, is indisputable. But, as has been observed by others greater than I, if we do not learn from the mistakes of the past, we can be certain about repeating those errors in the future. Of course, there would be nothing more debilitating than simply having an exercise which allowed old battles to be refought and to be relived. But, to the extent that that was demonstrated in the minority report to which I attested my signature, the problems in the Authority thus far have not been restricted to the areas to which the honourable senator referred; rather, they have extended to very real difficulties amongst present and past members of the Authority. There is clearly a morale problem, at least as perceived by some employees of the Authority. I would have thought that there was some virtue in ensuring that those matters are more properly behind us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no doubt that, with the approach that has been taken by Mr Justice Phillips, we will see a new attitude within the Authority and I think a new understanding amongst all the members of the Authority. I think its attitude, for instance, towards our Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is quite different from that which I have perceived in the past during the short time I have been a member of that Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer honourable senators to one of the inevitable problems that the Committee now has, and that is the clash between the secrecy provisions which I think are found in section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act and subsections (1) and (2) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, which is causing some difficulty to the extent that, when we have sought what I would have thought was fairly elementary information, such as whether an inquiry was undertaken into the circumstances of the past Chairman's resignation-with very legitimate reasons for requesting that information-the Authority has been un- able to provide us even with that. It suggested that to tell us that was to leave us with the revelation as to whether or not it was an operational matter. That is, to say the least, absurd. The Authority has properly said that it has to concern itself with the secrecy provisions and that, if it could receive certainty beyond that which is presently available to it that it would not be in breach of section 51, it would be happy to disclose further information.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Clerk of the Senate has proffered a view which is shared by a number of senators that it would not be in breach of that section because of section 49 of the Constitution and because of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It seems to me, if we are to embrace the view given to us by the Solicitor-General, that that opens up a whole new vista in respect of many Acts. I think that about 300 Acts contain secrecy provisions. I refer honourable senators to, for instance-without debating a Bill which I do not think has actually been introduced yet-to a Bill which will be dealt with by Senator Michael Baume relating to the Australian Sports Drug Agency. If one refers to clause 67 of that Bill, one will see secrecy provisions which, in my view, at a very cursory glance, seem to be not terribly different from those contained in the National Crime Authority Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I assume, if one were to pursue the proposition being put forward by Dr Griffith, that it would be an offence with a penalty of two years gaol, for instance, for the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Agency to come before the Committee, having been perhaps subpoenaed-the Committee using its coercive powers-and then being required to disclose the names of the athletes who have tested positive in recent testing. I would have thought that that is an intolerable proposition to be putting to us. Frankly, it would make impossible the functioning of committees in terms of executing their responsibilities. I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate to me whether I have got it right or whether I am on the wrong tram.

         â€”In relation to the particular difficulty facing the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have already indicated, in answer to a question in the Senate-I think it was last week or earlier this week-to Senator Spindler that I believe that getting the balance right between the proper supervisory role of the Parliamentary Joint Committee and the need for the National Crime Authority to operate in a secret fashion, without disclosure of the sorts of investigations which it is undertaking, is a very difficult one indeed. I do not believe that the balance is at the right point at the moment.

        I believe that, whilst it was quite proper for the Solicitor-General's opinion to be relied upon in relation to a particular dispute which arose, it may be that neither I nor Senator Crichton-Browne would have written the opinion in exactly the same way. But there it is and, as I say, I believe that it was quite proper for the National Crime Authority and others to have regard to that opinion as definitive. I do not think that one can seek a higher opinion from within the government system than that of the Solicitor-General, who is a most esteemed and eminent Queen's Counsel.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do believe that the whole question of the relationship between a parliamentary committee and its scope of inquiry when confronted by a secrecy provision shielding an organisation into which it is making an inquiry or over which it has a supervisory role, is one which can depend less on a supposed clash between the privileges of the Parliament and the secrecy provisions than on a simple inquiry into the proper scope of an inquiry which can be undertaken by the Committee.

        Whereas normally, standing committees and select committees are bound only by terms of reference given to them by the chamber or chambers, in the case of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority, of course, there is a set of statutory parameters as to the sorts of inquiries it may properly undertake. As I understand it, the Solicitor-General's opinion really depended on saying that the question of a clash between privileges and secrecy provisions did not get off the ground because the parliamentary committee was not proposing to investigate a matter within its terms of reference. In other words, it was acting ultra vires. So I do not think the matter has exactly been resolved even by the Solicitor-General's opinion, and that gives scope for an investigation of the balance--

         â€”I do not believe that the matter of the balance that I have been referring to is actually resolved by the Solicitor-General's opinion because, as I understand it, he really went on the ground that the Parliamentary Joint Committee was proposing to act in a way which was ultra vires its statutory terms of reference. I think that is a correct way in which to express it. What I am saying is that, not only in relation to this particular provision but in relation to all the secrecy provisions as they might clash with the asserted privilege of the Parliament to inquire without fear and to allow parliamentarians to be absolutely fully informed of a matter under their supervision or investigation, those matters can still be looked at. In fact, I said in an answer to Senator Spindler, which I referred to earlier, that the Government would look to his particular contribution as a constructive one as part of that process, and I believe that is still the case.

         â€”This is why I am confused, but I am easily confused so forgive me. There is a distinction between sections 51 and 55: 51 is the secrecy provisions, and 55 is the powers of the Authority. Clearly, if the Committee exceeds its powers-and I assume this is justici- able-an injunction or some such process could be sought which could be determined in the appropriate court. That is one matter. For instance, that might arise where a question is asked of a member of the Authority which might be, in his view, impinging upon the secrecy provisions, but is in his judgment outside section 55 because the terms of reference-the statutory powers and particularly the responsibilities-have been exceeded. Presumably he can seek relief from being required to answer that question on the grounds that the matters being inquired into are beyond the authority of the Committee.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That is quite different to, for instance, a reference that without question is inside section 55. But that question might be one which the Authority member judges to breach section 51 and not in any way bring into question section 55, and that was one of the matters which was raised. As I understand it, one of the questions asked was whether the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 provides immunity for any member or member of the staff of the Authority who provides information to the Committee notwithstanding the secrecy provisions of section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. That is the threshold question that we are seeking determination on, irrespective of whether any particular questions that impinged upon secrecy were, for instance, operational matters or anything else outside the scope of the authority of the Committee.

         â€”I am not sure that it is very conducive to investigating the legal niceties to have a continual exchange of opinions across the floor of the chamber in the Estimates Committee of the Whole. I have tried to indicate that the Government is aware of the difficulty of ensuring that an authority such as the National Crime Authority-vested as it is with powers which certainly at the time of its creation were not vested in any other law enforcement agency in Australia-ought to be subject nevertheless to some sort of democratic supervision to ensure that it does not act in a way which undermines the very democratic fabric of the society we are purporting to defend against organised crime.

        In so far as the privileges of Parliament are an important part of the armoury of the elected representatives of the people to ensure that information is properly made available to those parliamentarians so that they can discharge their duties, those privileges have to be taken very seriously into account and perhaps need to have a decisive democratic weighting. But, I do not believe that the issue was resolved absolutely fairly and squarely in the opinion to which I have referred. The matter of that balance is still open to discussion and I am sure in the ensuing months that discussion will continue and we will also have the benefit of being able to review not only the Hansard of this debate so far, but also other contributions that no doubt will be forwarded by the Parliamentary Joint Committee itself as a collective expression of its view as to the proper balance.

         â€”I agree with Senator Tate's opening comments. I did not want this to be an exchange of views, and in fact I do not have a view. I was just putting a position which I understood to be one that was tolerably acceptable. I continue to raise it because, as I understand it, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has made it clear that the Solicitor-General's opinion has been embraced and that is the official position. If that is the case, how does that impinge or impact upon other legislation such as the proposed Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill?

       <para>
        Although perhaps this is not the appropriate time to raise this matter now, to save me hopping up again I will do so: the Minister may be unaware of it but I have introduced a Bill to amend the Act; a declaratory amendment which provides beyond doubt that the Parliamentary Privileges Act will prevail in respect of section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act. That gives the Committee no greater powers or authority, because nothing in section 55 changes. It simply clears up that question. If the Committee trespasses outside its powers, that can be dealt with in a quite separate way.
       </para>
       <para>
        I raise those two points: the fact that what I have suggested I would have hoped might be an acceptable position to the Government; and also I ask what implications there are for other legislation as a result of the opinion that the Solicitor-General has given. As the Minister says, he is not God. Perhaps I should precisely reflect what he said- `others may have written the opinion differently'-which implies that there might be two points of view. But on the basis that it has been adopted by the Government, what implications does it have for other legislation?

Therefore, I believe that his opinion will have some impact on the question of the proper interpretation of other secrecy provisions, scattered as they are amongst hundreds of provisions to be found in many statutes of the Commonwealth. I believe that that general inquiry being undertaken by the Attorney-General's Department into the secrecy provisions right throughout the whole statute book will be assisted by the opinion of the Solicitor-General.

I believe that the opinion will be useful, but it may not have a wide ranging impact on the way in which the Government reviews the operation of all the privacy provisions which have been undertaken.

This chamber is more conscious than almost any other chamber in the Western world, I would think, of the need to ensure that there is proper secrecy of matters held by government agencies in relation to citizens, residents and even transient visitors to Australia. There are many concerns which have to be addressed, and these have been approached in somewhat of a piecemeal fashion. The Government thought it was appropriate that a more comprehensive look at the way in which the secrecy provisions had grown up would be useful, and that is being undertaken.

         â€”Mention is made at the end of the report of Estimates Committee E that the Committee thinks it appropriate that certain matters be at least open to further examination if people want to take this up. I have dealt with one this morning, which was the administration of the Family Court in Adelaide. The second was the funding and work of the National Crime Authority, due to public concerns about it. I think that the Committee did the right thing in making that recommendation.

        As the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) is no doubt aware, the operation of the National Crime Authority has been a matter of considerable public debate not only in the last couple of months but for a long time, particularly in my State of South Australia. It is appropriate for Parliament to provide opportunities to honourable senators who might be concerned about that to raise those concerns. If they choose not to do so, that is their business. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, in the interests of speeding through the appropriations, I might have passed by the opportunity that recommendation 14 provides.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Minister made some comments yesterday in Question Time that I want to link to that. I think this can be cleared up reasonably quickly. When responding to a question from Senator Faulkner about the National Crime Authority's published change in direction, the Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it would be useful if the Parliamentary Joint Committee considered, not so much raking over dying embers of past disputes, which I agree were matters of concern, but looking to the matters which will be canvassed by the National Crime Authority and investigated by it as it assembles admissible evidence in relation to major criminal activity in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two parts of the Minister's remarks concern me but I will deal with only one part today. The two parts I have identified are, first, the suggestion that any `dying embers', as the Minister put it, should be left and, secondly, his very positive view that the Committee will be able to work with the Authority as it assembles admissible evidence in relation to future matters. I am not sure just how much information the Minister thinks the Authority has ever given or will give to the Committee. I hope we can look to positive changes in that respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the first part of the Minister's remarks that cause me some concern, namely, the words `not so much raking over past embers of past disputes'. This Committee, as the Minister will be well aware, has tabled one report since I have been on it-that was in May-relating to the state of the Committee's knowledge of Operation Ark. As the Minister is probably no doubt aware, there was a bit of fuss over not so much that report but the dissenting report attached to it. That is the only matter of which I am aware that the Committee has had the opportunity-to paraphrase the Minister-to `rake over'. I could make a very good case that the Committee was not given adequate opportunity to rake that over. The full story on that is still not known. Can the Minister cast some light on what other past disputes exist that ought to be left alone?

         â€”I have no intention of providing a check list of past activities of the National Crime Authority that could be investigated by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority. I am sure that Senator Vanstone has many on her own little list somewhere that she is ticking off quietly. I was referring more generally to matters which had arisen, in particular, from relations with other law enforcement agencies and even within the National Crime Authority such as, for example, the way in which either lawyers or police officers were given greater prominence in particular investigative teams and were put in charge of particular inquiries.
        </para>

       <para>
        I think that those sorts of matters of concern which, it was alleged, led to a lowering of morale and to territorial disputes and jealousies with other law enforcement agencies were very well dealt with by Mr Justice Phillips in his statement, endorsed by the intergovernmental committee of Ministers in Alice Springs last Friday, when he made it clear that every effort was to be made to secure a more collaborative, cooperative approach with other law enforcement agencies. This would extend to the lawful sharing of intelligence. It would also mean that, internally, there would be proper regard and respect for the various skills offered by police officers together with lawyers and those skills would be acknowledged. In those ways, I believe that remedies were foreshadowed, many of which will be put into operation by Mr Justice Phillips, for many of the matters which led to those sorts of concerns. No doubt Senator Vanstone has heard about those-I have read about them only in the press-in the public hearings of the Joint Committee in its general review.

        I should have said in answer to Senator Crichton-Browne that it is the intention of the intergovernmental committee to put in a submission to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. We hope that that will be a useful contribution to the Committee's deliberations.

         â€”I thank the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) for that answer. I share his view that the reputation of Justice Phillips precedes him. I have nothing but a positive approach to what will happen with the National Crime Authority in the future. My concern has been very much allayed by the Minister indicating that what he referred to was not what I thought it was and that in fact he was referring to the administrative problems that do not now need to be raked over if we can see a solution.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I make it clear that my view, as a consequence of the new Chairman's appointment, is nothing but positive. But I add that that does not encourage me to do two things. First, it does not encourage me to shut my eyes and think, `Now that we have got Justice Phillips we do not have to worry; we do not even need a joint parliamentary committee to oversee them'. I have no doubt that Justice Phillips is a good bloke, but there is a possibility of his being deified to such an extent that nobody bothers to cast a critical eye in the future at the National Crime Authority. That is not a mistake I intend to make if I can avoid it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the parliamentary Committee is charged with the task of overseeing the Authority. It does not do that on a day by day, month by month basis. It has to review the past. Can the Minister state that he and the Government is not in any way seeking to block the Committee from making an evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Crime Authority, for example, up until the appointment of Justice Phillips? Otherwise, the Committee has nothing to do for six or twelve months. It is blocked by the Act from inquiring into current operational matters by the whole definition of its task to review-that is, look back-at what the National Crime Authority has done. That is one limitation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other limitation is the need to look at only past operational matters. I am very concerned that the Government is trying to block off an evaluation of the past efficiency and effectiveness of the National Crime Authority; that is, prior to the appointment of Justice Phillips. That would be a very bad thing. An enormous amount of taxpayers' money has been spent on this. If it has been wasted, the taxpayers are entitled to know. That is no reflection on what will happen in the future. If it has been wasted but the remedies have been found and we have a better chairman-or a man for the times, if one does not want to put it in terms of better or worse-and things look good for the future, well and good. But we do not say to the Department of Social Security, `Oh well, you have a new Minister, so we do not really care how you spent the money last year'. Parliament does not say that in a general sense to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Defence or to any of those bodies, notwithstanding that a Committee is charged with the task of looking at what has happened.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only blimp, if you like, that Parliament has heard from this Committee thus far is in relation to Operation Ark. There has been a lot more going on and a lot more money being spent, and what I am seeking to satisfy myself about so that I can allay concerns in the community as best as I am able is that the Government is not going to use every trick it can to block off looking at the past in this sense-and I quite like the Minister's wording-of `raking over dying embers of past disputes'. Albeit the Minister has clarified that he was not referring to what I am now referring to, I am still seeking an undertaking that the Government is not going to try to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Committee members were very surprised to receive a letter which is now public knowledge. I cannot quite remember which newspaper I read it in; it was either the Australian or the Sydney Morning Herald-I do not think it was the Age. In any event, I read in a national daily that the Attorney-General had written to the Committee and suggested that it might not be a proper time to have an evaluation because we have a new chairman.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one speaks to any person involved in the history of statutory authorities, that is what they all say- `Look, we have made a bit of a mess of this but we are cleaning it up now. We have a new chairman. We have a new board of directors, a new this, a new that, and a new name'. So why does the Minister not look at what has happened in the past? It is an appalling thing when so much of taxpayers' money has been spent. The past simply has to be looked at.
       </para>
       <para>
        That letter suggested that it might not be an appropriate time to have an inquiry as to the past, and I cannot think when would be more appropriate. Why it would be more appropriate to inquire into the early years of the NCA 10 years from now, I am at a loss to imagine. Surely now is the time to look back to find out what problems there have been and to make an assessment of what changes need to be made. To the extent that Mr Justice Phillips has made them, well and good; and to the extent that he has not, perhaps such an evaluation will acquaint him with further opportunities for improving the situation of the National Crime Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us not imagine for one minute that one announcement on 23 November is the panacea for all that might be wrong. I doubt that even Mr Justice Phillips would suggest that no more improvements could be made. I put it to the Minister that an evaluation of what has happened in the past may reveal other problems of an administrative nature, and that changes could be made within the NCA to make sure such problems did not arise again.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very embarrassing for a parliamentary committee to be told by the relevant State bodies that they are preparing a submission-even to be told, as I understand it, by some that the submission is ready-and then to receive a letter advising of an intergovernmental committee (IGC) decision that it is not really appropriate to have an inquiry now, that any of the bodies under the jurisdiction of this happy little band of men will not now be putting in a submission, but that the IGC will. So much for scrutiny by Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have been told effectively by the IGC, through the Attorney-General, is, `Look, Parliament, you can go and do something else with yourself other than the task you are charged with because we have sat together and we have decided it would be much better if it was done this other way'. That is most inappropriate, and I would be very pleased to hear from the Minister some explanation, such as there may be-I am at a loss to imagine what it will be-as to why, as I call them, a happy little bunch of men can get together and say to Parliament, `Go and do something else other than that with which you are charged'.

         â€”I can see that it is because the intergovernmental committee is composed of men that it has particularly roused the wrath of Senator Vanstone! Putting that sexist comment to one side, it is important to recall that this intergovernmental committee is not a committee of officials; it is a committee of Ministers, elected representatives of the people in their various jurisdictions, answerable to their parliaments, responsible to their parliaments, and with a very real political sense therefore of the necessity for the National Crime Authority to conduct itself in a way which is able to gather public confidence. As Mr Justice Phillips himself acknowledged recently, it is in the context of public confidence that it can best operate and we, as a committee of Ministers, intend to ensure that that democratic base for the operations of the National Crime Authority is maintained. Therefore, we are as interested as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in ensuring the efficient and honourable discharge by the National Crime Authority of its functions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is important to make the point that we are both different groups of elected representatives of the Australian people with different duties conferred on us by the various sections of the National Crime Authority Act. But I am sure that the Federal Attorney-General, in writing to the Committee as chairman of the intergovernmental committee, was not trying to say to the Committee that it should not undertake a particular review. He was simply questioning the timeliness of the review. Indeed, since that time, as I mentioned to the honourable senator, there will be prepared by the intergovernmental committee-which means by the Ministers responsible to their parliaments-a submission that will be forwarded to the Joint Parliamentary Committee for its consideration and, I hope, its edification.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also important to point out that the Government recognises the role of the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its review function. I believe it is important that it be able to monitor and review the performance by the Authority of its functions and report to the Parliament in accordance with that monitoring and review function. I recall very well in the prelude to the 1987 election, I think it was, when I was Special Minister of State, that Senator Brian Archer, on behalf of the Opposition, kept on calling for the repeal of the sunset clause and I kept on saying no, it was not appropriate until the Joint Parliamentary Committee, for example, had conducted a review. In fact, the Joint Parliamentary Committee did so and concluded that the National Crime Authority had performed not merely adequately but in a way which allowed the Parliament to confidently repeal that particular sunset clause. That is an important point to note in the whole unfolding history of this parliamentary supervision of the National Crime Authority. It has already been undertaken in relation to the question of the sunset clauses being lifted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The function of the Committee, or the duty of the Committee, to put it even higher perhaps and in accordance with the actual statutory provision in section 55, envisages not only this monitoring and review function but also, linked inextricably to it, reporting to the Parliament. The point I was making there was that that is in order to secure remedial action if it is required. What I was trying to say to Senator Crichton-Browne was that I believe in many ways a new directions paper endorsed by the intergovernmental committee in Alice Springs last Friday does not pre-empt the Joint Parliamentary Committee but indicates that many of the remedies which it would probably have suggested are already being put in place-and to that extent the type of review it might wish to undertake is probably not quite as necessary as if governments and the National Crime Authority itself had shown an unwillingness to remedy deficiencies as they were apparent to the Authority or to governments, quite apart from reports by the Joint Parliamentary Committee. So I think that section 55 is still an important section obviously in the National Crime Authority Act and the Government has no intention of trying to minimise the importance of that particular provision.

         â€”A number of remarks the Minister made occasion some concern. I appreciate what the Minister says about the intergovernmental committee (IGC) and its function, but nonetheless the course outlined is effectively to say to the parliamentary Committee, `Look, you could speak to a whole raft of people here, but we will act as a filter between you and them, and we will tell you what we have distilled as to what they would say'. To an extent, each State is entitled to do that with the bodies under its control, but I think it is regrettable.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not see why the IGC could not undertake its task and leave the Committee to undertake its task and speak to the people to whom it chooses to speak. I remind the Minister who primarily pays for the operation of the National Crime Authority (NCA). It is not the State Attorneys-General; I know it is in part, but not primarily. It is all very well for the State Attorneys-General to get together to have a bit of a chat about what ought happen in terms of a review, but they are not answerable to the taxpayers who are funding it. However, we in this place are, and it involves millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. I do not think it is appropriate for the State Attorneys-General to give hints to the Federal Parliament about whether it ought to bother inquiring into what has happened to money collected by the Commonwealth Government and primarily spent by it. In my view everything seems to be turned up the wrong way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second remark made by the Minister that caused me some concern is that the Committee has a reporting function that can alert Parliament to things of a remedial nature. By that I hope the Minister did not mean that that is the only occasion on which the Committee should report.

        I would be interested to hear the Minister's assessment of the performance indicators the public should use-and I assume the Committee can use the same ones-for the National Crime Authority. How should we judge whether it is doing a good job? I do not think we can judge that by whether the NCA has good or bad press. We all know what the media are like. The media are interested always in a bad story because it makes things more colourful. They do not necessarily want to write up the achievements. I understand that not all the achievements of the Authority can readily be made public at the time they are made because that might in some way prejudice following further criminal rabbits down holes, if one wants to use that analogy. What performance indicators does the Minister use to assess whether the Authority is achieving its set task?

         â€”This is a difficult problem which has exercised the minds of members of the Joint Committee. I recall that it was the subject of a report to Parliament by the Committee, perhaps at the time of the review of the sunset clause. The Committee in its report said-and I agree with it-that it would be simplistic simply to look at a scoreboard approach, at the number of arrests, charges, successful prosecutions, lengths of sentences and so on, because that cannot necessarily tell us the quality of the work being undertaken.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I will not mention names, but if a major figure, named and featured in various royal commission reports as a leader of organised criminal activity in Australia, who, through corruption of police commissioners and lesser officers, particularly in a certain jurisdiction, had evaded prosecution not just over decades but virtually over generations, were to be eventually successfully prosecuted by the National Crime Authority-even if not on a direct serious criminal charge but, for example, on a tax charge, which was the way in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually dealt with Al Capone-that would be a significant victory. It would be a signal that major crime figures in Australia could be targeted successfully by the Authority and that their position was not beyond reach of law enforcement. That is, they would be prosecuted and sentenced and would serve out a gaol sentence in accordance with the term set by a judge.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, it would point to a qualitative difference in the relationship between the community, as represented by its parliaments passing certain laws to create certain criminal offences and asking law enforcement agencies to enforce those laws on the one hand, and those engaged in organised criminal activity on the other. A very important signal was sent out by the National Crime Authority in relation to that by its successful prosecution of a particular crime figure. I know that Senator Vanstone knows to whom I am referring.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am saying that a simple scoreboard approach will not suffice. On the other hand, the relationship with the various directors of public prosecutions is also very important and is a proper criterion to use. It is one thing for the National Crime Authority to say its task is simply to assemble admissible evidence and hand that over to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), but it is quite clear that a close relationship needs to exist between the two, particularly in the final stages of the preparation of that admissible evidence. It is essential that cases do not fall for lack of credible evidence being brought before the magistrate at a committal proceeding or before a jury in a trial situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that it is when magistrates or juries in particular throw out a charge brought on the basis of evidence assembled by the National Crime Authority that its reputation in the community suffers terribly. For example, the use of accomplices in particular criminal activity as witnesses needs to be dealt with extremely carefully by both the Authority and by the DPPs concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that a mature and sensible approach to that relationship with the DPPs will be extremely important, not only to the successful operation of the National Crime Authority in securing convictions, but also thereby in the standing that it has in the community. There is nothing more damaging than remarks made by magistrates which are aimed, quite properly in some instances, at the deficiencies in the relationship between the DPPs and the National Crime Authority in that regard. It is even worse when a major trial has been conducted for weeks or even months and the jury finds that a particular witness is so lacking in credibility that it does not convict the accused.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are some of the criteria which might be used, but it is not an easy matter. I am sure that the Joint Committee in its current review will pay great attention to the proper criteria and how they are met, or not met, by the Authority.

I realise the contribution made by the State Government in the running of the NCA in South Australia; nonetheless it is a Federal body. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the situation in South Australia where there is almost despair in the community in terms of what the Authority is doing in Adelaide. I was amazed to find in some reports recently that the Authority had been leasing offices in the same street as my office and had been watching for months someone in the office opposite the one it had leased. I have been trying to work out for weeks which office the NCA was watching. But that was all called off. I have not yet had the opportunity to make inquiries about that matter, but it is just another example of the sorts of reports we see in the Adelaide newspapers all the time-National Crime Authority bungle here, bungle there and bungle almost everywhere. Frankly, there is nothing to show for it in South Australia. Heaven knows what the NCA has been doing for the past 12 months. What does the Commonwealth Government have to say to the people of South Australia about the effectiveness of the Authority as it operates in that State?

I believe that it is more properly the responsibility of that Government to answer to the South Australian public in relation to its operations within that jurisdiction. However, the Federal Government has indicated its intention that when the current inquiry so funded by the South Australian Government is concluded, it would want an office to be maintained by the National Crime Authority in Adelaide and a transition arrangement will need to be put in place to ensure that that is achieved successfully.

        The Minister indicates, rightly, that the Bannon Government is paying for this, and perhaps questions should go to the State Government in that respect. If the Commonwealth Government is unwilling to comment on the up-to-now view of the effectiveness of the Authority in South Australia on the basis that it is not paying for it, so it should not worry, let me put the question to the Minister another way. The Minister has indicated that when the Adelaide office closes under Labor Government funding, his Government would like to see a National Crime Authority (NCA) office in Adelaide. On the basis of what the Government now knows about the conduct of that office in Adelaide, would it be happy to take over that office? In other words, has the Government made an assessment that the running of the NCA in South Australia is such that the Commonwealth would be happy to just shift in and take over?

At present it is undertaking particular references given to it by the South Australian Government. Once those are concluded, the structure of the organisation will be required to carry out a more general role in accordance with such references that might be given either exclusively by the Commonwealth Government but touching on South Australia, by the South Australian Government exclusively, by both governments, or by a series of South Australian and other State or Territory governments. All that combination of possible references and activities will determine the way in which the South Australian permanent office-Federal office; national office, if you like; branch office of the National Crime Authority- will be set up. I have no doubt that Mr Justice Phillips has plans afoot as to the way in which that might be organised. But I am not privy to them and I am unable to elucidate further.

They are to be found at pages E15 to E18 of the Hansard. I also refer the Minister to answers to certain questions that were then taken on notice. Those questions refer to the possible use, ironically, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by an international committee established to monitor how countries are observing the convention and the possibility of a provision in the convention for the purposes of promoting abortion in various countries.

        At the Estimates Committee I referred to a provision in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women-the CEDAW convention. Article 10, paragraph (h) in the Convention on the Rights of the Child relates to family planning services. That provision is quite similar to a provision in the CEDAW convention. Article 10, paragraph (h), states:
       </para>
       <para>
        State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in order to ensure to them equal rights with men in the field of education and in particular to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women:

        Here is a relatively similar provision to that contained in CEDAW. As I mentioned at the Estimates Committee hearing, the provision relating to the CEDAW Convention is being used by the monitoring committee to question countries about the provision of abortion services-and I quote its words; they are not mine. The Chair of the international monitoring committee for CEDAW is none other than Justice Elizabeth Evatt. I gave evidence to Estimates Committee E that the CEDAW committee is being used in such a way as to promote abortion on the basis of a similar provision as is contained now in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
       </para>
       <para>
        At Estimates Committee B I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to explain why the United Nations (UN) committee established by the CEDAW Convention criticised countries with anti-abortion laws for their failure to comply with the articles of that Convention. I indicated then that no mention had been made of abortion in the CEDAW Convention, nor was any mention made of abortion in the travaux preparatoires relating to the articles in the CEDAW Convention, yet the evidence was that the committee is, in fact, questioning countries about their provision of abortion services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here is a danger that a similar committee, which is to be established under the Rights of the Child Convention, could use a similar provision in the Rights of the Child Convention to promote abortion. Is that not ironic? I asked the Minister about this and his response came back later. In Senate Estimates Committee E I raised this with Senator Tate and with a representative of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I asked whether the UN committee to monitor the Convention on the Rights of the Child would question countries on their provision of abortion facilities. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has responded by saying that the committee had not yet been established and its membership was not known. In his written reply he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Convention provides for the establishment of a Committee on the Rights of the Child, to consist of experts in the field covered by the Convention to be elected by secret ballot of State Parties to the Convention. These experts will sit on the Committee in their personal capacities, not as representatives of the States of which they are nationals. They will have the task of developing an approach to monitoring the implementation of the Convention and their work will contribute to the development of international jurisprudence in this area. The first Committee has not been elected as yet; elections will be held by March 1991. All of these factors make it inappropriate to attempt to forecast or pre-empt the work of the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want a guarantee from the Federal Attorney-General that there will be no way that a monitoring committee to be established under this Convention-that is, the Convention on the Rights of the Child-can promote abortions and thus destroy the lives of children in participating countries. I think it is fair for me to ask that because, again, I say that a similar provision in the CEDAW Convention is being used for that very purpose. Indeed, I referred the Estimates Committee to a statement made by Justice Elizabeth Evatt as reported by Associated Press in the international news database on 24 January 1990 as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most important issues that the committee takes up with states is their provision of family planning and abortion services for women, Evatt said.
       </para>
       <para>
        I asked the Minister what Justice Elizabeth Evatt was on about. The response that has been received from the Attorney-General is that Justice Elizabeth Evatt denies having made that statement. I cannot find the response that was given but, in effect, from memory, that is what was indicated. I have here the computer print-out of the report from the international news database. Either the reporters are wrong or Justice Elizabeth Evatt is not telling us what she said.
       </para>
       <para>
        One has to accept-having been given the response by the Attorney-General-the word of the Attorney-General and Justice Elizabeth Evatt, but that begs a question. Whether or not she actually said to the reporter what is contained in this document that is in my hand is really irrelevant. The question is: are Justice Elizabeth Evatt-as Chair of the inter- national monitoring committee for CEDAW-and the committee questioning countries about the provision of what they called abortion services in those particular countries? That is what I want to know. What, in fact, is she doing? What, in fact, is the committee doing? I refer the chamber to the information which I detailed to Estimates Committee E which showed that there is a record of this sort of inquisition about the abortion facilities of these countries taking place.

         â€”So many matters have been raised by Senator Harradine that it is difficult to know precisely what requires to be answered, except to say that, as far as the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is concerned, it should be emphasised that the committee of which Justice Evatt is a member has no power whatsoever to give authoritative interpretations of the Convention. I believe that if it attempted to do so in the area which Senator Harradine has mentioned it would be going beyond its proper role.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In saying that, of course, I am not admitting that, indeed, that particular line of inquiry was undertaken in the way that has been attributed to Justice Evatt. I am unable to resolve the particular discrepancy between the apparent publication of her views and the clear answer which she has given to be conveyed to the Committee, except to say that I believe that she would be a truthful and honest person, given her high status, in denying that she made the remarks that have been attributed to her.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it abundantly clear that article 24 (2) (f) is part of the implementation of the right mentioned in article 24 (1). That is, of course, concerned with recognising the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, et cetera. It is within that context that article 24 would fall to be interpreted, if it ever required interpretation, by the states party to the Convention. The proper interpretation of that matter would therefore fall to Australia as a state party. I believe that there is no indication whatsoever in the travaux preparatoires, which have been examined by the Attorney-General's Department or the Foreign Affairs and Trade Department-in those basic documents which lead up to and form the foundation for this particular article-that they were in any way designed to allow the promotion of abortion under the guise of providing guidance for parents in relation to family planning education.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply believe that the role of the committee in relation to the CEDAW Convention has been overstated. I might say that in relation to article 10 of the CEDAW Convention, Senator Harradine already received the answer that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has been unable to find any interpretation suggested by the Committee or relevant aspects of article 10 in the material referred to by Senator Harradine or generally. The fact that members of the committee asked questions relating to abortion does not imply that any particular view has been adopted by the committee. In particular, the questions asked of the representative of Ecuador, to which Senator Harradine referred, do not presuppose any view of the circumstances in which abortion should be permissible. To our knowledge, the committee has not published any general comments or suggestions on this question.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that the role of the committee in relation to CEDAW has perhaps been overstated and perhaps misstated, if what Justice Evatt has indicated is the case in relation to the publication of her supposed views is in fact the case. In relation to article 24, I have here a note which might be of interest. As far as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is concerned or is aware, there has been no suggestion in the travaux preparatoires for the Convention of the Rights of the Child of an interpretation of article 24, such as Senator Harradine has suggested. I think that is the important point. It is commented that the relevant portion of that article was proposed by the representative of Venezuela, a country with relatively restrictive abortion laws, and it is most unlikely that such an interpretation could have been envisaged. There is a reference to the United Nations documents which are relevant. I think that answer has been provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think all that can be said is that as far as one can judge in the putting together of article 24 (2) (f), there appears to have been no intention on the part of the states parties to indicate that abortion services ought to be promoted as part of the fulfilment of the implementation of the right mentioned in article 24 (1). Indeed, it would seem on the surface to be incompatible. I believe that the matter is left to the understanding of the states parties such as Australia, and we have already made very clear our understanding of the Convention in so far as it relates to the question of abortion.

         â€”Senator Tate has given information which I already know about and which I have already stated. I object to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regurgitating what I have already told it. The answer that Senator Tate gave me states blandly that the Commission has been unable to find any interpretation suggested by the committee of relevant aspects of article 10 in the material referred to by Senator Harradine or generally. I told him that, of course. There was no mention in the travaux preparatoires, in the CEDAW Convention as it relates to the three articles that I mentioned previously; no mention at all. Yet those articles are being relied upon by the monitoring committee to promote questions amongst states parties to the Convention as to the provision of abortion facilities in those States. That is the very point. They have been used by the CEDAW monitoring committee. What guarantee is there that a similar article in the Convention of the Rights of the Child will not be used in the same way? I agree with the Minister that these are separate but of course related questions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister mentioned the preamble to article 24 in the Convention of the Rights of the Child. If one has a look at the preamble to similar provisions in the CEDAW Convention, one would wonder how the CEDAW monitoring committee could possibly ask countries about the provision of abortion facilities in those countries. After all, the CEDAW Convention is all about the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. Discrimination on what grounds? It is really about equality of rights of men and women. How could it possibly be interpreted so as to enable a monitoring committee to press countries to provide information about abortion services in those countries?
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask the Minister: will he provide the committee with the minutes of discussions that have taken place by the CEDAW monitoring committee over the last 10 years so that we can test this matter and get it perfectly clear? Will he ask Justice Elizabeth Evatt whether she considers that one of the most important issues that the CEDAW monitoring committee takes up with states is their provision of abortion services? Will he ask whether she consider that it is appropriate for the monitoring committee to ask countries about the provision of abortion services for women? I would like to have that response so that we can get perfectly clear where we are at in respect of that committee and the provisions of the CEDAW Convention where they are similar to the provisions of the Rights of the Child Convention.

         â€”Senator Harradine has more accurately stated-if in fact it proves to be the case that any of these questions relating to abortion facilities were raised in the way that it has been put-that the committee was promoting questions concerning abortion facilities. That is quite different from my understanding of the earlier thrust of his assertions: that the committee relating to the CEDAW Convention was promoting the provision of abortion facilities. If it was asking or promoting questions about abortion facilities, it may still be that they are beyond the scope of the committee on a proper interpretation of article 10 of the Convention.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It has to be recognised that the committee asks questions in relation to reports submitted by states parties. I am unable to say at the moment whether the question of abortion facilities was mentioned in any of those reports, and that might give ground for the sorts of questions that have been put rather than the promotion of the provision of abortion facilities being the purport of any questioning undertaken by members of the committee. On that matter I think I might take a punt and say that the charter for the committee to be established in relation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child is in article 43.2, which says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee shall consist of ten experts of high moral standing and recognized competence in the field covered by this Convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the field covered by the Convention is, in a sense, of an important limiting character. As abortion was a matter not dealt with precisely by the states parties in drawing up the Convention, if I was appearing before the committee and asked a question about the provision of abortion facilities, I would say that it is not the field covered by this Convention. I would deal with the matter in that way.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to Senator Harradine's particular questions as to providing the minutes of the CEDAW Committee going back some 10 years, I will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) whether in fact he has a means by which the minutes can be made available to Senator Harradine. I think it would be his responsibility. I do not imagine that it would be impossible to provide.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regarding Senator Harradine's second question asking me to relay certain questions to Justice Evatt, of course I can relay them, but I should say that, in her capacity, status or function as a member of the committee of the CEDAW Convention relating to the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, she is there in a personal capacity and not as a member of any agency of the Federal Government. In that respect, I take it that her appointment to that committee comes from the United Nations and that the secretariat of that committee would fund her participation in that committee's work. As I say, she is a member of the committee in a personal capacity and, therefore, it may well be that she declines to give an answer. Of course, she would not be responsible to any Australian Minister for the way in which she conducts herself on that particular Committee, but I will forward the questions.

         â€”In answer to a question put by me on 7 November, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I anticipate that when the Australian Government ratifies the convention, should it do so, one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. It would be surprising were that not the case, given the fact that Australia inserted article 5, meaning that for the first time in the international community a document was open to ratification which recognised that pre-eminent role of the family, parents or legal guardians in giving guidance and direction to children in accordance with their evolving capacities.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was an answer to a question that I raised with the Minister. I referred to a previous question by Senator Childs. The answer Senator Tate gave to that question was that the Holy See and a number of others had backed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I asked whether it was really fair for the Government to continue saying that the Holy See had actually backed the Convention when the Holy See, in acceding to the Convention, made several reservations.
       </para>
       <para>
        One reservation was in respect of the interpretation of the issue of the rights of the child before as well as after birth and the rights of the child to protection before as well as after birth. Another reservation related to the rights of the primary and unalienable rights of parents, in particular in so far as these rights concern education, religion, association with others and privacy. It was to the latter-that is, to the rights of the parents-that the Minister was referring when he indicated that he anticipated that, when the Australian Government ratifies the Convention, one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. Is this currently the case?
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the Minister mentions that Australia inserted article 5. I must have a different copy of the travaux preparatoires to the Minister, but I have had a look at the part of the travaux which is the report of the working group on the draft Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I would be grateful if he could indicate whether there is some other document which establishes that Australia in fact inserted article 5.

         â€”In relation to article 5, my clear understanding is that it was indeed the Australian delegation which kept pressing for some such recognition as finds its expression in article 5, and was indeed the leading catalyst in the various discussions and deliberations which took place as the Convention reached its concluding stages. I do not know what is exactly in the travaux preparatoires in relation to article 5, but I am advised very firmly that Australia played an instigating role in the insertion of that particular article. It is because it is such an important and innovative article that Australia takes such pride in it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to whether it ought to form the text of an accompanying declaration upon the ratification of the Convention, the Government, on reflection, having considered that possibility, is now of the view that that might detract from the single, clear statement of article 5 in that, not by way of reservation but by way of declaration, one would merely be trying to repeat, perhaps in some sort of paraphrase, the effect of article 5. It is thought that it would be better to leave article 5 unadorned, but highlighted in any accompanying statement made by the Government on the ratification. But as to a formal declaration of article 5, it would be purely affirming language. In so far as it was even modestly or minutely different from the actual wording of article 5, it might be taken in some way to query whether article 5 was as strong as we certainly affirm that it is. It is important to perhaps read article 5 in full:

       </para>
       <para>
        That is an extremely important recognition- I believe the first in an international convention-of the way in which parents have a role, rights and duties recognised and respected by state parties to these international conventions. That will certainly be highlighted in any statement from the Australian Government which accompanies its ratification of this particular Convention but which will not form an accompanying declaration in the very formal sense of the law of treaties.

         â€”Mr Temporary Chairman, I know that you would not permit a debate on the Convention, but I would like to debate the latter statement of Senator Tate by giving him reference to certain other articles which do appear, by their constant repetition, to diminish those rights in certain ways. One wonders why the Holy See decided that there should be reservations. Presumably it considered it important to have an international focus to overcome the very disconcerting treatment that is meted out to children in a number of countries. I have said on a number of occasions as well that an international convention is an important area. It ought to be on the record that the Convention on the Rights of the Child was born out of the desire to eradicate the exploitation of children in those countries where children are treated as chattels. There does need to be an international focus for these efforts and the Convention may well provide this.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As part of my reservations, however, I indicated that there is a danger that articles of the Convention could be misinterpreted by some social engineers, both at home and abroad, and particularly in the United Nations Monitoring Committee, unless the Federal Government does take appropriate action and makes reservations on the articles of the Convention about which valid concerns have been raised. I was interested to note that Senator Tate, in answer to the question, indicated that `one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged'-and that at the time of ratification. Now it appears that the Attorney-General does not believe that and Senator Tate has indicated that he feels it might be a watering down.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is a strengthening of the situation and we need to have some clear indication by the Government as to the protection of parental rights and the need for protection of the unborn child as well. Mr Temporary Chairman, I am sorry: I am probably debating the issue now, and I will not do that. But in respect of parental rights and article 5, the parts of the traveaux preparatoires which I have in my hand do not indicate that it was Australia that initiated article 5. I do not discount what the Minister is saying. For the completeness of my file on this subject, which goes back to 1980, I would like to have there an indication that Australia did take the leading role in this area. It is important for the completeness of my file and for the record.

         â€”There is one other question I want to ask within the Attorney-General's portfolio. I raise this matter because it is important to get on the record some of the comments that have been made in responses to questions that I asked at the Estimates Committee. I refer to questions that I asked of the Institute of Criminology. It will be recalled that in the Estimates Committee hearing on 13 September I raised a number of questions with the Institute of Criminology officials. I referred to the report of the Committee on Violence. Without going over it-and I know I would not be permitted to go over the questions I asked in Estimates Committee E-I do want to refer now to a response that was given to one of those questions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        My questions were related to the report of the National Committee on Violence Violence: Directions for Australia. I had raised quite a series of questions as to what time was used by the Committee on Violence to discuss the question of the likely effect that hard-core pornography would have on its viewers and on the development of callous or violent attitudes amongst its viewers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The responses that I was given indicated that the Committee spent very little time indeed-in fact, hardly any time-on this issue. I asked how long the National Committee on Violence had spent examining the harmful effects of videos in reinforcing or framing various attitudes. That is a precis of a question that I asked. The answer that has now been given to me on notice is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Although it is not possible to respond to this question in terms of hours spent on the topic, it can be said that the issue was raised at several of the Committee's seven meetings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The issue was raised at several of the Committee's seven meetings! It continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it was the view of all but one Committee member that because of the breadth of the Terms of Reference, this was not an issue which the Committee was able to debate at length.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet I point out to the Committee that the vote at the House of Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory to ban this type of video material-that is, hard-core porn-was lost by one vote. That was the vote of Mr Collaery, the Attorney-General. Mr Collaery placed a great deal of emphasis on the report of the National Committee on Violence. He quoted the National Committee on Violence in support of his vote.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here we have an admission by the National Committee on Violence and by the Australian Institute of Criminology, which provided the secretarial backup for that National Committee, that it was the view of all but one member of the Committee that, because of the breadth of terms of reference, this was not an issue which the Committee was able to debate at length. Anybody who knows the situation knows that there was a very brief time devoted to this matter-an extraordinarily brief time. The response went on:
       </para>
       <para>
        The one member not of that opinion-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is to say, the member who believed that proper consideration should be given to the possible development of a violent mentality as a result of the viewing of this material-
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Peter Quinn, resolved his position by submitting a minority report on the subject, which is found at pages 252 to 259 of the Committee's Report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also raise the question as to why the Committee said in its report that I had referred to research which purported to demonstrate the adverse effects of non-violent erotica. I did not use that term at all. The Committee on Violence is supposed to have its facts correct. I did not use the term `non-violent erotica `.

         â€”No, because it is a term that cannot be used for the material which is officially described in the explanatory memorandum to the previous ordinance, which is now the legislation, as hard-core pornography. The Institute of Criminology, which was giving the backup to the Committee on Violence, chose to put words in my mouth which I did not use. When I asked why it did that, the answer was this:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The term was used in reference to research discussed in the Report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. It was used to distinguish between violent and non-violent sexual material in the context of their differential effect on the viewer's response in terms of violent behaviour.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is a disgrace. I think it shows a lack of awareness of the issues that are involved. It also shows a degree of ignorance about the work of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. The fact is that we were discussing material which is described officially, as I indicated, in the Federal Government's explanatory memorandum as hard-core pornography, not non-violent erotica.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the words of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, it treats women `as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience and reduces persons to objects or occasions of sexual pleasure'. This material is exploitative and degrading. Although physically non-violent, it cannot be labelled or described in the manner that the Institute of Criminology and, through it, the Committee on Violence have done without violating the true meaning of the words that they used.
       </para>
       <para>
        Evidence cited by the Joint Select Committee majority shows that such material engenders a sexually calloused and manipulative orientation towards women. It was interesting to note that at least four of the behavioural scientists whose research was submitted to the Committee saw this non-violent hard-core pornography as being more harmful in this regard than even the violent, explicit pornography which is already banned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I invite honourable senators to look at what is contained in the transcript of the meeting of Estimates Committee E on 13 September and the admissions that are recorded there, and then to judge whether one can take any notice at all of the statement or the assertions made in the report of the Committee on Violence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not have taken the time of the Committee, except that that report was used quite innocently by the AttorneyGeneral in the Australian Capital Territory. He thought the report was well researched-in this instance it was not and has proven not to be-and it was referred to by him in support of his decision to oppose the banning of this material.

         â€”Mr Chairman, I refer to a reservation that I made to the report of Estimates Committee E. That reservation relates to aspects of investigations and prosecutions under the War Crimes Act. No-one in our society can do anything but recoil in horror at the thought of the genocide that occurred during the Second World War. The horror of what we have been told about human beings engaging in the mass slaughter of other human beings just seems to be too much for us to accept and comprehend in this day and age. It is fortunately an era which was before my generation but it is one which, particularly in recent years, has more and more come to light. We should never forget the horror and the bestiality of mankind during those times.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I suppose the Second World War has had its counterparts during my generation but these conflicts have not been on quite the same scale. In more recent times we have heard of genocide in Ethiopia and on the Horn of Africa. In South Africa at the moment there are allegations of one black tribe slaughtering another black tribe. We have heard stories of mass killings in Iran and Iraq for no reason apart from ethnic origin and background. A lot of these things are as horrific, I suppose, but they are not on the same scale as what took place in World War II. So nothing should ever be done which in any way lessens the horror with which we treat war crimes which were committed during the Second World War.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply want to raise again whether this nation should be spending the sort of money it is using to pursue alleged war criminals so long after the event. My understanding from the figures given to Estimates Committee is that something like $16m has been spent to date on war crimes proceedings, references and investigations under the War Crimes Act. That seems to me to be an extraordinary amount of money in view of the results that have been achieved from those investigations.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are in a time of economic crisis. The world and this nation currently face an enormous number of problems. Many people in this country are currently living in desperate poverty and absolute distress and yet we have spent what seems to me to be an inordinate amount of money in pursuing war crimes prosecutions with no real result.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I understand it-and maybe the Minister will be able to elaborate if things have progressed since the Estimates Committee hearings-one person has been charged and there is a possibility of two or three others being charged. That seems to be the end of it. I repeat that if there are guilty people in Australia now, we should spend the money to prosecute them. But it has always seemed to me that the investigation of war crimes, under the Act, was doomed to failure from the start. The problems of prosecuting an offence so long after it was committed are horrendous and should have been seen as such. It does seem to me that the money has not been wisely spent in the programs under this War Crimes Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wonder whether the Minister might indicate just how much longer action is going to be taken under the War Crimes Act; how much longer the special investigations unit is likely to continue; what the costs are likely to be in the future; and what possibility there is of any convictions or further charges being laid as a result of the expenditure of this enormous amount of money.

         â€”Mr Chairman, it will be apparent to the Committee that the question of the war crimes prosecutions very much depends on a decision to be taken by the High Court of Australia. The High Court has reserved its decision and the whole question of the constitutional validity of that legislation is now being determined by the justices. I guess that will be quite a long deliberative process by them, and I would not imagine that we would get an answer before the end of this calendar year. So I would say that we are some way away from knowing whether in fact there is a firm constitutional basis for this whole edifice constructed on the basis of legislation passed through this Parliament to deal with war crimes of the horrific nature which Senator Macdonald has acknowledged.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to the actual expenditure, I believe the honourable senator said something about $16m having been spent. I have figures before me which indicate-and these are only brief notes from the officers available to me-that the total expenditure on the special investigations unit (SIU) has been $3,798,539 as at the end of August; on legal aid, some $332,722; and on the Department of Public Prosecutions, some $404,938. So, to that extent, it falls somewhat short of the $16m that the honourable senator mentioned-in fact, about $12m short. As to the question of the length of time that the SIU might take to complete its investigations, I am advised that that might be towards the end of the next financial year- 1991-92.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the honourable senator asked what were the prospects of success for the prosecutions. That cannot be answered, except to say this: this Parliament and this Senate in particular were very adamant that the same rules which apply to the trial of any accused person in the Australian criminal justice system be applied in this particular instance. In particular, that casts an obligation not only on the court process but I believe on the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply stringently the published rules relating to his prosecution policy-I believe in this instance with a particular stringency because, naturally, one would not wish to subject a person to the situation of being an accused and, therefore, being submitted to a committal proceeding and/or trial without having a strong case.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I believe that the honourable senator can rest assured that the usual rules relating to prosecution policies will be stringently applied and that there will be the fairness and impartiality of our courts, supervised by the judges to ensure that there is no abuse of process-of course, this clause was written into the Bill and modified at various times as it progressed through the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ultimately, the foundation of our criminal justice system, namely, the capacity of a jury to make decisions as to questions of fact involved in the alleged criminal offence, will be the safeguards which will ensure that such prosecutions as are undertaken will be successful only if 12 members of the Australian public selected in the normal way are convinced that the crime alleged actually did occur. I believe that is the fundamental safeguard in ensuring that these prosecutions, if they succeed, will succeed because they deserve to succeed.

         â€”I do not suppose it achieves much by being pedantic on the figures, but in the Estimates Committee hearings I did add them up and come to a total figure on all costs associated with these things, including legal aid and the Special Investigations Unit, of $16m. I suggest to the Minister that that was acknowledged by Mr Greenwood when I put to him that it cost $16m to get one person to court. He said, `No; to get this one person to court plus four others'. Whilst he objected to my counting of the numbers that might get to court he seemed to accept that, all in, something like $16m had been spent. If the Minister would like to look at page E76 of the Estimates Committee transcript, he will see the figures $9.5m plus $4.4m plus $3.9m, and in round figures that is $16m. I wonder whether the Minister might elaborate for me, some two months later, whether there has been any progress in getting the other four to court. I accept that there are sensitivities, that he cannot identify them or cannot be specific, but I would like to know how we are going in getting those four others to court and whether there is now any likelihood of anyone else being charged. Are those four cases the end of the matter? Will the whole process wind up after that?

         â€”I have had a quick look at page E76 of the transcript. All I can say is that I think there may be slight confusion as to the money appropriated as opposed to the money spent. I think it was even explained during the Estimates Committee hearing that the appropriation was in anticipation of certain trials getting under way, and legal aid of a very large amount being required in relation to those trials. Of course, the prosecutions of four or five cases have not been undertaken and cannot conceivably be undertaken in this financial year. I think that is the difference: I was talking about money spent; Senator Macdonald was really speaking about money appropriated.

        With regard to the question of the other three or four cases and how they are progressing, I have no further information that I can usefully convey to the Committee. Quite clearly, there is something of a hiatus in the consideration of whether these matters can be brought forward, as we await the High Court's reserved decision. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that Mr Greenwood and Mr Weinberg are carrying on conversations about the readiness of particular matters to be handed to Mr Weinberg, but I have no further information for the Committee on the actual state of those three or four other cases.

It is very difficult to say, except that quite clearly the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) personnel will be available to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for other duties. As far as the Special Investigations Unit is concerned, clearly that has been formed for a specific task. It comprises persons seconded from other organisations and I think they would probably go back to those organisations. Other persons with individual personal expertise, for example, in relation to historical research, language expertise and so on, would go on to other employment in their careers. In other words, a lot of them were not transferred from other Commonwealth departmental duties. It is a bit hard to say exactly what will happen to all the personnel, except that the DPP's people will certainly go back to other duties within the DPP's office.

         â€”My questions relate to my reservation which was with regard to the start-up date and various matters relating to the resourcing of the Australian Securities Commission in Western Australia. As the Minister knows, I have pursued this matter more than any other since I have been in the Parliament in the past six months, and I have raised with him a number of concerns I have had about the start-up date and how achievable it is, particularly in Western Australia. I have also raised matters of concern about the company number. A lot of the agitation that I caused led to the Government announcing some 10 days ago that there would be a moratorium on prosecuting people who did not comply with that particular part of the new legislation.

       <para>
        This evening I want to run through matters that were discussed at the Estimates Committee hearings where the answers were incorrect, inadequate or just downright wrong and in some cases misleading. The position now in Western Australia is that the Attorney-General, Joe Berinson, in introducing the legislation in the Legislative Council in Western Australia-I think it was last Thursday-has now agreed with my proposition that it is impossible to have the Australian Securities Commission up and running in Western Australia prior to about March.
       </para>
       <para>
        The assertions that I have made in the Senate during Question Time and at other times is that the office in Perth has no staff at this stage; that no offers have been made to Corporate Affairs Commission staff at the State level; and that the computer system is far from being at a stage where it could be expected to be operating by 1 January. The training of staff to use the new computer system actually commenced when one person was sent to Sydney to start training. When that person got to Sydney the computer system was in a state which did not allow that training to continue. That particular person, I believe, was going to be used to train some of the staff who have yet to be recruited in Western Australia. He has not been trained, so I doubt whether he is in a position to train the staff in Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are issues that I raised during Estimates Committee hearings in September. Broadly speaking, I was given assurances that the staff were being recruited and that they would all be recruited by 1 January; that the computer system would be set up in plenty of time for 1 January; and that the very existence of the company number-or the corporate ID card, as I like to call it-had been advised to professional groups in Western Australia and around Australia. That was the way in which the Australian Securities Commission intended informing the business community of the need to print this company number on all of its public documents, cheques, et cetera.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of months after that, by making inquiries of a range of accounting practices around Perth, from the very large organisations and the medium sized accounting firms to even one-and two-man accounting practices, I found out that not one of them had any idea of this simple requirement to have a company number. I was told only 10 or 11 days ago that inquiries made to a hot line set up to solve this problem-I believe it is called the Australian Securities Commission hot line-could not even help people by telling them where this company number would appear.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have asked the Minister in the Senate about the cost-that is, the cost of printing these eight-or nine-digit numbers on people's public documents, cheques and company seals-of complying with just this small part of the legislative package. I was told in Question Time that the cost of compliance would be negligible. I think I have said on other occasions that if we estimate the cost at only $100 for each company and multiply that by 800,000 companies, we start getting into some pretty big numbers. This is a cost with which small business people do not really need to be burdened during these harsh economic times.
       </para>
       <para>
        With that preamble, I will now move through some of the specific matters which have not been resolved since the Estimates. One of those is the question of whether there was any contingency plan if the Australian Securities Commission were not able to be set up by 1 January. The Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Berinson, has now publicly said that he does not think it at all possible that the Australian Securities Commission will be up and running in Western Australia by that date.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the Estimates hearings I was told that there were no contingency plans because this 1 January start-up date was absolutely imperative. Obviously it was decided not to have a contingency plan because it was thought that 1 January was totally achievable. I remind the Minister that the Australian Securities Commission in Western Australia has committed itself to leasing about 4,500 square metres of space at 66 St Georges Terrace. At this stage the plan is to fit out only one of the floors, possibly prior to 1 January, and to fit out the remainder of the floors possibly, if we are lucky, by March or April 1991. Clearly, one of the questions I would like answered today is how will the Government reassure the business community of Western Australia that continuity of service will be provided to it-continuity in prosecution and investigation and continuity in the general watchdog role of the new corporations scheme-when it has a dying Corporate Affairs Commission and an Australian Securities Commission which it seems logistically cannot be set up by 1 January.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only announcement I have seen of the moratorium on the prosecutions for not using the new company number indicated a period of six months. I am not aware of any other announcement; there may have been. I believe that Ron Edwards discussed the matter during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives. I ask the Minister: in view of the assurances I was given by Australian Securities Commission people about their publicity campaign to make the business community aware of the company number-a publicity campaign that either was not happening or was extremely ineffective-what will be done to inform the business community of this moratorium? Can the Minister also tell me whether the moratorium applies to the implementation of the company number on all of the places and documents it is required by the legislation to be put onto, or does it exclude the company seal?
       </para>
       <para>
        While the Minister is talking on that issue, can he also inform the Committee what has been done in the light of clear public perception to inform companies that they have to have this company number on their company seals prior to 1 January, if that moratorium does not apply to that company seal? If 800,000 companies have to run down to the rubber stamp shop between now and Christmas to get their stamps made, during my holidays I might go and set up a rubber stamp shop.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other issue that was not answered in the Estimates Committee, and I do not believe I have been informed of subsequently, concerns the result of the Remuneration Tribunal's determinations about the salaries and remuneration of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some other issues I would like to raise relate to an answer I was given by Mr Robinson at the Estimates Committee, which said that a consultative committee was being set up to look at all the issues relating to service levels in Western Australia. He said that the Corporate Affairs Commission in Western Australia was looking at some of the measures of service level that could be provided and some form of guaranteeing or putting those guarantees into an agreement that I believe will be annexed to the legislation after it has passed through this place, I guess.
       </para>
       <para>
        My understanding is that the major group concerned with this matter in Western Australia, WAOG, or the Western Australia Opposition Group, which represents the Law Society of Western Australia, the Confederation of Western Australian Industry, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia (Inc), the Stock Exchange, the Western Australian branch of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, the Western Australian branch of the Institute of Directors in Australia, the Western Australian Council of Trustee Companies Association and the Western Australian branch of the International Association for Financial Planning, has not been consulted one iota on this matter since September or even before that. Indeed, it put a very detailed letter to the Chairman, Mr Hartnell , on 8 June, which until about 6 o'clock eastern standard summer time last night had not been replied to. This letter was from the Chairman of that group, Mr Laurie Shervington, setting out a long list of concerns the group had, mostly recognising the inevitability of the new national scheme and hopefully providing some input to the Australian Securities Commission and to Mr Hartnell in particular as to how some guarantees about the service levels to the business community in Western Australia may be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the assurances I was given at the Estimates committee hearings about encouraging the compliance of the business community with this new scheme are to be believed, I would have thought that some form of consultation with a group such as the Western Australia Opposition Group would have been desirable. That consultation has simply not taken place. I believe that the only discussion was at a cocktail party that Mr Hartnell attended in Perth some months ago, but there has been no formal consultation. Indeed, the entire process of consultation or public discussion about the formation of the Australian Securities Commission since the agreement was reached in Alice Springs five or six months ago has been non-existent. It seems that some boffins have been sitting around some rooms negotiating this legislative package, trying to figure out how they can get this new scheme up and running by 1 January and trying to keep it as quiet as possible because as each day goes by, we see a disaster looming. This disaster has been approaching for some three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also raised the issue of the staffing levels and the recruitment program in Western Australia. I would like that addressed. If it is the case that recruiting of staff for Perth is on track and under way and will be completed on time-that was the assurance given at Estimates committees-why is there still no staff in Perth, except for I think one gentleman? Why has a director not been appointed in Perth? How the hell does the Government hope to get this up and running when it has no director, no staff, no computers and no office?
       </para>
       <para>
        Could the Minister also explain to me the point I raised about the Senior Executive Service (SES) profile for the office in Perth? There are significant concerns in the Perth business community that the general level of professional competence within the regional offices will be much lower than exists in the Corporate Affairs Commission in Western Australia at the moment. This SES profile matter is a matter of some concern to my constituents. I will raise other matters once the Minister has had a chance to deal with that, if that is appropriate.

         â€”I thank Senator Campbell for his questions. It is true that Senator Campbell, since entering the Senate, has taken a particular interest in this matter, and to some extent his concerns have been justified. I say that because I have certainly answered him on several occasions in regard to the Australian company number (ACN) in a way which was more confident than the facts have allowed to transpire. As a result, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has announced that there will be a moratorium on the requirements that companies display their Australian company number on their business documents and eligible negotiable instruments. As has been noted, the moratorium will be for a period of six months from the commencement of the new national companies scheme, which is due to come into effect on 1 January, 1991. I will comment on that date later.

        But to elaborate on some further questions Senator Campbell asked about that Australian company number moratorium, the six month period of grace will not apply to a company's requirement to display its ACN on its common seal, nor on any document it will by law be required to lodge with the ASC. Companies will be required to display their ACN on their common seal and on all documents required to be lodged with the ASC under the corporations law from the commencement of the new national companies scheme. But during the period of the moratorium companies need not display their common seal on other documents.

        The question about the 1 January start up, particularly given West Australian concerns both of a logistic kind and in relation to the level of service that might be provided, is one that I think will be happily resolved. My confidence in saying that, although it is somewhat undermined by the experience of the Australian company number matter, lies in the fact that the Attorney-General of Western Australia has been perhaps the strongest advocate of the need for a proper level of service to be available to businesses trading and carrying on their legitimate activities in the regions of Australia away from the south east of the mainland. For him to introduce the legislation into the West Australian upper House, I think last week, indicates, I believe, that his concerns have been met and that he can confidently advocate the passage of that particular legislation. So I think that that is very reassuring.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1 January deadline is not an easy one to meet, but if I may go to some of the particular logistics which Senator Campbell raised, it is true that the ASC's new accommodation in Perth will not be ready, on latest advice, until the end of January. However, the ASC has made arrangements with the West Australian Government so that the ASC will use the existing West Australian Corporate Affairs Commission office accommodation until the staff move over to the new ASC office. In this way, neither the West Australian business community nor the staff will be unnecessarily inconvenienced and an appropriate level of service to the West Australian community will be maintained. I understand that the recruitment of new staff and the transfer of existing staff is in train for a 1 January commencement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe Senator Campbell regards the appointment of a regional commissioner as being particularly important. The ASC expects to be in a position to announce the appointment of all new regional commissioners by the first week in December. Honourable senators may know that a committee of interview has been established and that interviews have recently been undertaken. I think that committee has concluded its task, but in any case it is intended that regional commissioners be appointed by the first week in December.
       </para>
       <para>
        Offers of employment to all relevant West Australian Corporate Affairs Commission staff to transfer to the ASC are scheduled to be dispatched by the end of the first week in December, with a view to all those accepting the offers being transferred into their new ASC positions before the end of the month. So whilst it is very close to the deadline, I am advised that those logistical problems which Senator Campbell mentioned can be overcome to the extent that I have outlined.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree with Senator Campbell that consultative committees-I think they are formally called regional liaison committees-are going to play an extremely important role in gathering the support of the business communities, particularly in the regions of Australia. I am disappointed, if indeed it is the case, that a letter forwarded by the West Australian Opposition group concerned with service levels was not responded to in a timely way by the ASC. I believe that if that occurred that is an oversight which will not be the first swallow of the spring, as it were, or harbinger in the way in which the ASC will consult with the West Australian business community. I believe it is very important that the confidence of that business community in the provision of adequate levels of service is crucial and can only be secured by the sort of consultation which Senator Campbell and I and, I am confident, Mr Hartnell would regard as important.

        If the Australian Securities Commission is not able to more appropriately or effectively inform the business community of the requirement to have this number on their company seals within the next few days, before the silly season is really upon us, then the business community, bearing in mind there are 800,000 companies out there which have to get their common seals altered, will just not be able to comply. So I urge, as I have been for the last four or five months, that some sort of publicity campaign be waged. What will the Australian Securities Commission undertake to do? I do not think that sending out a press release-I am sure that my press releases do not get the same sort of coverage as the Australian Securities Commission press releases-will get a lot of coverage in the national media on the front page of the business pages.

        In the dying moments before the dinner adjournment, I thank the Minister for his answer to my question about the making of offers to Corporate Affairs Commission staff in the States and recognise that those offers will be made at the end of the first week in December.

        The other matter, which the Minister has answered, is this matter of consultation at the business community level in the regions. I believe that as part of the Act there will be an advisory committee set up. It has eluded me why, in this fairly contentious stage of getting the legislation and the application of laws legislation through-indeed, those sections of the Act were not proclaimed earlier-an advisory committee was not set up. Perhaps the Minister could address this point, and also whether there will be people on that committee from each State.

I was expressing some sympathy with the fact-I think I prefaced my remarks by saying `if it were true'-that the Western Australia Opposition Group (WAOG) had apparently written to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) and not had a response. That seemed to indicate that there would not be the sort of consultation which would be so necessary to engender confidence in the business community in Western Australia as the services were provided by the ASC regional office.

        During dinner, my officers spoke to Mr Hartnell concerning Mr Shervington's letter to him of 8 June concerning levels of service. Mr Hartnell has advised that the letter led to a continuous dialogue on the matters raised by it, both with Mr  Shervington and other members of WAOG and, indeed, with the Western Australian Government. Mr Robinson, a member of the Commission, replied in writing to Mr Shervington on Mr Hartnell's behalf, though I do not have a copy of that letter. The levels of service agreed with Western Australia reflect, in large measure, matters raised in those Western Australia Opposition Group representations. If indeed that is the case-and I have no reason to suppose that it is not-it indicates not only that dialogue has taken place, but also that, as a result of that consultation, some of the concerns regarding levels of service have been dealt with.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was then asked why an advisory committee is only now being established. I have already mentioned that regional  liaison committees are to be established in all regions and will involve local business. One of the agreed functions of the liaison committees will be to consider reports by the ASC of its performance against performance indicators. Such indicators are to be formulated in consultation with the business community. I do not believe that any delay has been caused in the establishment of those committees. Their major role will commence after 1 January.

        If Senator Campbell was referring to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee established under the ASC Act, that Committee has been operating for some time. What the legislation now before the Parliament will do in relation to that Committee is recognise that there should be at least one person from each State and the Northern Territory on the Committee. I understand that there is already one member on the Committee from Western Australia-a Mr Richard Lester. I cannot quite recall the other matters that Senator Campbell may have raised before the dinner suspension, but no doubt I could deal with them if he were to refresh my memory.

        Another matter I raised which could not have been responded to was the fact that the moratorium for compliance with the putting of the new Australian company number on the common seal would need to be more effectively publicised between now and 1 January. As I have  reiterated on a number of occasions now, very few of those people know about this requirement. Indeed, I have had representations from constituents, even in the past few days, wondering whether or not the moratorium did apply to company seals and so forth.

        While I am on my feet in relation to those matters, I might say that companies have been receiving their annual returns recently. A lot of the company annual returns have had far outmoded and outdated information on them, particularly in relation to directors. I was informed last night by a senior business person in Perth that the companies which had more than six directors had not received their new returns from the Australian Securities Commission, or wherever they are coming from. The understanding was that the computer system had been unable to deal with companies which had more than six directors on their boards. I do have many other matters, but I think those issues naturally flow into one group.

         â€”As to the training of staff who will be, one hopes, receiving offers of employment during the first week in December, I believe that most of them, having already been employed in Corporate Affairs Commission work, would have many of the skills and the experience required to enable them to make a reasonably easy transition into the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) regional office in Perth. I think that in light of such training as they will require over several months-or, one imagines, over several years-in a continuous training process, the lack of that initial week or two of their employment by the ASC will not greatly frustrate, hinder or impede what they will be required to do. They will take so much experience and skill already acquired with them.

       <para>
        As to the question of publicity, I agree with Senator Campbell entirely that the ASC has a major responsibility to publicise the requirement which remains as to the use of the Australian company number. I understand, although I have not seen them myself, that in some pages of the financial press or the financial pages of the major reputable dailies one can find advertisements indicating the company seal and Australian company number requirements. However, I agree that unless that publication and advertising is undertaken very vigorously and extensively the propriety of any prosecution might be called into question. I say that as a bit of a spur to the advertising campaign. This is one area where it is thought that the providing of the Australian company number is an essential part of the clean beginning of this particular operation by the ASC. I hope that over the next few weeks that is advertised in a way which gets to each company.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the information that is coming back on the company returns, I understand that that was compiled from existing State commission holdings of information-I cannot imagine where else it would be compiled from-and that if there is any deficiency it must be because of the holdings in the State corporate affairs commissions. The possibility that the computer system is unable to cope with a company which has more than six directors on the board is a completely new one to my advisers. That would seem to be an extraordinary lack of capacity. It seems implausible at first blush, but nothing is impossible, I guess. I cannot say anything more than that on the basis of information available to me.

         â€”That is right. It would be a good idea perhaps to investigate the matter. I am sure that the Minister and his officers will do that because most of my information seems to have been reliable, even though I may have gone off the rails a fraction in relation to the matter of the responses to the letter of 8 June. But I will bring myself back on.

        The other point I would raise-and it is not a particularly important one-is that when the annual returns were being sent out the opportunity was taken to distribute a brochure on the various workings of the Australian Securities Commission. That material contained some information in relation to the establishment. I guess it is a case of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted but it would have been a good idea to use that opportunity to have information about the company's number incorporated in that brochure. If there are still more annual returns to go out, it would be a good idea to enclose a copy of the media release or something else.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the other matters I raised during the Estimates Committee hearings was the matter of the transfer of information, which would seem, in relation to the compilation of the annual returns themselves, to have run amuck. I take on board the Minister's comments about the information provided to the ASC from the State corporate affairs commissions being inaccurate. That is possibly one concern. However, the business people who spoke to me said that they had lodged annual returns on time every year for many years and that all the information that the Corporate Affairs Commission had was up to date. Yet, when they got the annual returns the information was, in some circumstances, up to a decade old. Again, that does not need an answer; it just needs some investigation. I would say that this is just one example of the many teething problems we will have in trying to set up a massive database to deal with a conglomeration of 800,000 companies that used to be handled in each of the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has tried to assure me that the training that I referred to back in September would now take place not over a period of four or five months but effectively over three weeks at the end of December when most people in Western Australia are usually over at Rottnest Island or somewhere similar. I remain unconvinced that we can have this whole system up and running by 1 January. Therefore, I am unconvinced that we will be able to take people away from the Corporate Affairs Commission, where they are using totally different technology, and train them within such a short period in the use of what I have been assured on many occasions is new technology. I place on the record my prediction that the level of service to the Western Australian business community will be affected in some way-I hope it is only a small way-during particularly the first weeks of January.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I ask the Minister whether there has been communication with the Attorney-General in Western Australia, Joe Berinson, since his article in the West Australian of Friday's date where he says publicly that he does not expect the Commission to be set up in Western Australia until March. I would say that, if that article is not corrected by the sort of information the Minister is providing to the Committee tonight, the result will be even more confusion, particularly in Western Australia, about just what is happening with corporate affairs regulation. One of the assertations that the Attorney-General in Western Australia makes-and I certainly would not say that that particular Attorney-General is always right-is:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the ASC's national computer and imaging system was also not likely to be operational in Perth until March 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        That assertation flies in the face of commitments I was given in September in Estimates. I do not think I have been given any guarantees tonight that the imaging system and the computer system will indeed be operational.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has indicated that the ASC will be using the State Government's offices for that interim period. He also said earlier that he expects the offices in Perth to be fully fitted out by the end of January. I would like the Minister to inform me how someone can fit out an acre of office space-4,500 square metres or thereabouts-when that fit-out, to the best of my knowledge, has yet to commence. If it has commenced, it has only done so in the last few hours. The building trade closes down in a few days time and does not come back on deck until mid-January. I would like to know how people can possibly be in that office by January. Even though these are logistic matters, unless they are confronted and solved, unless the sorts of contingency plans that I started talking about in September are confronted in a practical way and not just with fingers crossed, with a hope and a prayer, they will just lead to a shoddy start-up for what we all now hope will be the dawning of a new era for corporate regulation in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Minister knows, I was opposed to the national scheme but I have now come to terms with the fact that it is going to come to fruition. If we all kid ourselves, as I think the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has done for months now, that it is all going to start up on 1 January and it is going to be a success from day one, reality will dawn upon us at some stage and the only effect that that can have is that corporate regulation in Australia will continue to be the disaster it has been for the past three years. I ask for the Minister's response to those various matters.

         â€”In relation to the comments attributed to the Western Australian Attorney-General, Joe Berinson, I am quite sure that that interview must have taken place a little before it was eventually published because, as I understand it, legislation has been introduced into the Western Australian upper House and is scheduled for a second reading debate on Thursday, 29 November. That would indicate some preparedness on the part of the Western Australian Attorney-General to advocate its passage and to seek to have this legislation in place in order to provide a legislative foundation for the operations of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). From his point of view all that is immediately under his control is being attended to as expeditiously as possible.

        The matters of logistics have already been dealt with from time to time in the course of the last hour or so of the Committee of the Whole debate. As I pointed out-and I think I admitted it-office space would not be available on 1 January. Indeed, the Western Australian Government will make available accommodation in the existing Corporate Affairs office in order to provide for that staffing requirement until the move can be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the question of the general computer and the imaging computer-I know nothing about computers, but apparently these are the terms-I am told that they will be operational on 1 January, though perhaps not with the full capacity and full range of operational activity which they will undertake when they are in full flight. I understand that Mr Hartnell will shortly be raising with State commissioners the need for cooperative action to enable business centre staff around Australia to be made available for ASCOT training in the second half of December. As the honourable senator would know, ASCOT is an acronym for something-but for what, I do not know. Apparently the rather hopeful and prophetic acronym stands for `ASC on time'. If the honourable senator can believe that, he has had a very pleasant evening meal.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the honourable senator has raised, quite rightly, the sorts of matters which have been brought to his attention by the business community of Western Australia. The Federal Government and all participating jurisdictions are desperately trying to meet the 1 January deadline. I understand that Mr Hartnell cancelled an overseas trip in order to be on hand to ensure that the 1 January date is met from his point of view. So all efforts are being made and I hope that the 1 January deadline will be met, given the tremendous support that is now coming from all around Australia. I was pleased that the honourable senator indicated that, having taken a stand on behalf of the Western Australian business community in relation to its concerns, he is now anxious to see that the ASC operates as efficiently and as well as possible. I am sure that we all share that wish and I hope that it can be realised from 1 January onwards.

I would say my knowledge of computers is probably similar to the Minister's-quite negligible-but I am aware that there is an imaging system and a computer system, and there are obviously networking systems to allow people to search company records in Perth and get the information very quickly, we are assured, from the national database.

        From the Minister's answer in relation to office space, I would not envisage the Australian Securities Commission installing a lot of hardware at the existing premises of the Corporate Affairs Commission in Perth and then in March, April or May-whenever the Australian Construction Service completes the fit-out-wheeling all that hardware down William Street, along St Georges Terrace and up the lifts to the new offices. I am now reading between the lines but does the Minister envisage that the old systems will be used until the new office space is fitted out or will the new hardware be established in the old premises of the Corporate Affairs Commission and, at some added expense, later be transferred down the road to 66 St Georges Terrace?

In so far as the honourable senator is speaking of computer terminals and that type of thing, they can be readily moved in and out again. The actual working environment of the staff of the Australian Securities Commission will be such that this computer terminal equipment will be available to them pretty readily and it will also be easily transferable from one location to another. I cannot say much more than that. I do not think my officers here are well enough versed in the acquisition of computer equipment to go much further than that.

         â€” It remains an issue of concern to me. Although I do not know much about computers, I do know that if the Commission were to set up a new system which allowed people to get hard copies and facsimile copies of corporate records-and I imagine one would call terminals hardware-it will need some new terminals in Perth. The Commission will need quite a few of them if it is going to set up a staff of 190-odd people there. From the Minister's answer, it is clear he envisages having these new terminals put onto the national database system and then having them shifted physically in March, April or May when the new office space is fitted out. I do not think we can get much further on that. I reiterate my concern that I cannot see service levels being maintained for the Western Australian business community between 1 January and whatever date the office is completed.

        My next concern is that under the new national scheme the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Australian Federal Police will take over total responsibility for prosecutions and investigations in regional areas. Would the Minister be so kind as to inform the Committee what additional appropriations will be required to upgrade the staffing levels of both Federal Police and DPP offices in regional areas? What role would the Minister envisage for the experienced State police-I think there are five or six of them in Perth-who have concentrated specifically on corporate affairs matters? Will there be any transfer of any of those State police? If not, what mechanism will be set up to ensure that the experience gained by those people over many years of investigating and prosecuting corporate affairs offences in the region will be made use of, or will that experience be lost when prosecutions and investigations move from a cooperative system between the State and Federal enforcement agencies to the exclusive use of Federal enforcement agencies?

         â€”I understand that extra resources were appropriated for the various downstream agencies, if one would like to call them that, accompanying agencies or collaborating Federal agencies working with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) to regulate this area. For example, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) had an extra $1m allocated to it; the Director of Public Prosecutions, an extra $2m; the Federal Court, an extra $1.570m; the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, an extra $200,000; and the Australian Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, an extra $470,000. That gives some indication of the extra funding.

       <para>
        In relation to Senator Campbell's very interesting question about the skills available in State fraud squads and the like and the sorts of investigations that might be undertaken by those concerned to regulate this area, as I recall, under the legislation where there is a matter, for example, which is mainly to do with fraud under the State criminal code and there are associated, what might be called, corporate law matters, then the State police force can undertake the investigation as a whole, and vice versa. There will be occasions where most matters are under the corporate law but impinge on State criminal code conditions now and again, in which case the Federal investigative agencies can take the whole lot. So there is a sort of knock-for-knock basis which keeps some of the skills applicable in the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am further advised that there is an arrangement whereby State police officers can be made available on a paid for basis by both the ASC and the AFP to enable them to supplement their resources and to use the skills that the honourable senator mentioned. In that way, the particular expertise built up by some members of the State squads will be utilised and, as I say, a suitable payment will be made, I suppose, to the Commissioner of the police force concerned as these people are virtually seconded by him to the Federal agency for a period. I do not know the exact administrative arrangements, but I can get the honourable senator a more formal answer at some later point.

         â€”The other questions I have relate to the progression of the legislation from the date of the agreement made in Alice Springs back in June of this year to its final arrival into the Federal Parliament and into the Senate only in the last few days. I guess the parallel track of the legislation arrived in the Western Australian State Parliament only last Thursday. During the Estimates Committee hearing I asked what progress the legislation had made back in September. We were told that regular meetings were being held.

        My concern about this is that we, as senators, and our upper House colleagues in the various States-except for Queensland, which does not have the benefit of an upper House-all find ourselves in the position of having what is a very complex piece of legislation before us. As the Minister knows, all of us now, with a great amount of goodwill, do want to see a national scheme up and running as long as there are significant guarantees about service levels in the States, but we are in the invidious position, because of the inordinate delays in getting this legislation here, that we cannot, as a House of review here in the Senate and, similarly, in each of the States, seriously contemplate giving this legislation the sort of scrutiny that it really requires.

        Honourable senators will be aware that this massive package of legislation, which also relates to the 1989 package of Bills that has already passed through this place, was given less than an hour's debate in the House of Representatives the week before last. As my colleague the shadow Minister for justice, Peter Costello, said in the other place during the debate, roughly 12 seconds of debate was allowed on each page.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am already personally aware of a number of mistakes and drafting errors in that legislation, having gone through it; and I think it would have been far more desirable had one of our committees been able to look through this legislation and, in a positive light, tried to ensure that when it was implemented, whatever the start-up date was, it indeed got off to a good start.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that the Government has provided itself in the legislation with a mechanism whereby it can amend it by regulation without any reference back to this Parliament, which I see as a very unsavoury part of that legislation. It clearly recognises the problem caused by putting together such a complicated package in this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I guess that I am not harsh enough to suggest that the public servants involved with the drafting of this legislation would have delayed it to the last minute so that the Senate and the Legislative Councils and upper Houses in the States did not have time to consider it. That would be a harsh judgment. But I do think that the Senate deserves to have information provided to it as to why it took five months to put together this package, bearing in mind that really the only alteration was in terms of overcoming the problem caused by the High Court case whereby the Federal Government was proved not to have the power over incorporations, and coming up with this application of laws mechanism which has been bandied around for the last three or five years-possibly even going back further to the Whitlam Government days.
       </para>
       <para>
        Basically, it has now taken us five months to get this legislation. The House of Representatives was given one hour to debate it; the Senate really only has a few days to consider it and certainly does not have time to send it off to a committee for the thorough examination it deserves. It will affect the lives of millions of Australians and it will affect the way in which corporate life in Australia is conducted by 8,000 companies, yet this Senate will be denied the opportunity, either because of this delay or because of the Ascot principle of trying to get the Securities Commission set up by 1 January, which, I have already reached the conclusion, is not logistically sensible.
       </para>
       <para>
        I guess that it would be seen as a backdown or a public failure by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and by the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Hartnell, if they failed to achieve this date. Clearly they have made the decision that it is better to get it up at all costs, get the signs up on the door, bash on through, try to solve the problems and put out the bushfires as they occur, rather than do the sensible and democratic thing, that is, to allow the parliaments of Australia to make sure that this legislation will work when it comes in. Perhaps that is asking too much, but I think the question that needs to be asked here in the appropriations debate is why it could not be brought before the Parliament in a more timely way so that at least the parliaments could have assisted in the process of making sure that the national scheme laws were going to work.

I might just mention that from the Commonwealth side, we had Mr David Edwards as convenor, principal adviser in business law; Dennis Rose, the Chief General Counsel; Ms Hilary Penfold, the second parliamentary counsel; and Mr Brian O'Callaghan, senior adviser in corporations law. From the States we had Mr John Doyle, QC, Solicitor-General, South Australia; Ms Rowena Armstrong, Chief Parliamentary Counsel of Victoria; Mr Dennis Murphy, Chief Parliamentary Counsel of New South Wales; and Ms Robyn Chapman, director of policy, Queensland Corporate Affairs Commission. I mention those people because I do not think one could put together a more high-powered committee, yet it took as many months as it did to get this legislation together.

        In effect, as I recall, if we get on top of the first 81 or 82 clauses of the Bill, we are almost there. The rest is taking up the more substantive provisions of the law. The really difficult task is to understand and to grasp those first 82 provisions. It took that very high-powered group that long to put it together. Now that it is in the various parliaments, I believe that there is a very good will towards its early passage, not only from the various governments and the parliaments in all houses now, but also from the business community itself which wants to get this ASC operation and the national companies and securities law up and running.

       <para>
        As to the regulation-making power, I think there has been something of a misunderstanding. It is a narrowly confined regulation power to deal with difficulties that might arise in the transition period. Its purpose is only to ensure, of course, that there is complete competence in the investigating, regulating, administrative and prosecution spheres. It ensures that nothing which was done wrongly prior to 1 January cannot be taken up and dealt with properly from 1 January onwards. If any difficulties arise in those transitional arrangements, they can be dealt with by way of regulation.

        I would seek to have a conference with Senator Robert Hill, Senator Campbell and any other interested senator regarding the incorporated or foreshadowed amendments that Mr Peter Costello brought forward relating to those matters. I think it can be explained in a way which might relieve some of the misgivings which apparently were generated by the form of those provisions. In fact, they cover a very narrow compass to do with the necessity to ensure that the transition does not leave any gaps in the enforcement of the law. Of course, as they are regulations, it must be emphasised that they will be tabled before the Parliament. They can be dealt with by the Senate by way of its normal powers of disallowance in relation to the tabling of any regulations. Therefore, that will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I would not want the thought to be there that this was something the Executive could do without parliamentary scrutiny of the most intense kind, and of a kind which has the ultimate sanction of being able to disallow that regulation.

         â€”The second last matter I wish to raise is the formal agreement which is referred to in the Bill. I would like to know from the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) what stage that formal agreement is at and when we are likely to see it. This is an agreement that is going to be annexed to the Act when it is passed through both Houses of Parliament. The other issue is something I forgot to raise in relation to the companies number on the moratorium. Even though there is a moratorium on enforcement of companies complying with the requirements in relation to all of the public documents, except for annual returns and other lodged documents, and the company seal, the fact of the matter is that the company number part of the legislation will indeed be law, as we all know, even though the fact that Joe's Deli Proprietary Ltd does not have a number stuck on his invoices will not make him liable to a fine.

        One of the matters which is of concern to me is that if, for example, a company suffered some loss because another company had not complied with that section of the Act, civil action could ensue from the fact that Company B, for example, had not complied with the Act and Company A was going to take civil action against it. Can the Minister inform me, as a non-lawyer, whether the matter has been looked into? Is there anything that the Government can do about it? Does the Minister see that as a potential problem with this company number matter and the fact that a moratorium has had to be called?

Whilst there are some provisions in the proposed legislation which require the presence of certain information on various documents, and their absence will give rise to the possibility of the civil liability, that does not apply in the case of the actual Australian company number.

         â€”I thank the Minister for the answer in relation to the civil action regarding the absence of a company number. I take it from what he said that he does not think that some civil liability could flow from a company not having a company number. It is hard to envisage exactly what sort of action could be taken, and I am sure it will be a matter which will become clear once 1 January has passed, but one of the problems with the centralisation of the company names register is that there will be many companies in Australia which do share the same name and because the legislation and the logistics of the legislation do not allow for any great differentiation between companies, except for the fact that you will not allow any two companies with identical names to be registered, I would envisage that there is likely to be a great upsurge in passing-off actions around this country as larger companies try to move in and take over the markets of smaller companies with names that may not be identical but could be very similar to existing registered business names in the States.

         â€”I wish now to give a brief answer to a question raised by Senator Harradine concerning Estimates Committee E. Senator Harradine asked me what role Australia had played in regard to the insertion of article 5 concerning parental direction and guidance in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I have a document entitled, `Question of the Convention on the Rights of the Child: Report of the Working Group on a Draft Convention on the Rights of the Child'. The Chairman-Rapporteur was Mr Adam Lopatka of Poland. This document comes from the Commission on Human Rights in its forty-fourth session, dealing with agenda item 13. In paragraph 27 it says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Australia, Austria, the Netherlands and the United States of America submitted the following proposals --
       </para>
       <para>
        then some numbers follow. Article 5 follows in these terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        The States Parties to the present Convention shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, where applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her rights enumerated in the present Convention in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, having due regard for the importance of promoting the development of the skills and knowledge required for an independent adulthood.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was obviously an original proposal which was modified in later discussion. Paragraph 28 goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        In introducing this proposal, the observer for Australia stated that the proposed article would incorporate into the convention two important general concepts: (a) the evolving capacities of the child, and his or her rights as enumerated in the draft convention, and (b) the rights and duties of the parents who raised the child, who provided guidance to and took primary responsibility for the child.

         â€”In the report to the Senate of Estimates Committee D, the Committee showed concern about the increased use of trust accounts and the removal from Estimates committees and the Parliament of the ability to scrutinise as closely as before the activities of various subprograms. That is fairly clearly spelt out in the report of the Committee. I shall address my remarks briefly to that because the Department of Administrative Services could almost be called the flag bearer when it comes to the use of trust accounts.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would like to make it quite clear that I totally support efforts to genuinely commercialise those areas which lend themselves to commercialisation. I think the descriptive material about what has happened in the Department of Administrative Services has used the term `quasi-commercial operations' when referring to these various programs. I think it is the belief of everyone that the benefits and the changed attitudes, which should inevitably follow the commercialisation of these various areas, should introduce a completely new attitude and spirit within the public sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principle is that instead of relying on direct appropriations, revenue must be earned from clients to cover expenditure. In the main, I think there are nine trust accounts within the Department of Administrative Services. Most of the revenue earned-by far the great majority-will, in fact, come from other government departments. Of course, this means that even though the revenue we are talking about is off budget as regards the Department of Administrative Services, it is on budget as regards other departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to make the point that the system will only work, firstly, providing that there is genuine competition; secondly, providing that there is accountability to the Parliament; thirdly, providing that there is no political interference to frustrate genuine commercialisation; and, fourthly, providing that, with captive clients and thus monopoly charging, inefficiencies are not hidden.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I mentioned at the beginning, trust accounts are probably the way to go and the introduction of proper accrual accounting plus the financial management improvement program will enable departmental heads to act, as closely as they possibly can within the restraints of the Public Service, as business managers and to make appropriate changes to ensure that they are responsible for a viable, efficient organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        With genuine commercialisation and genuine competition, it may well be that some of these quasi-commercial operations may not survive. All I can say is that if that is the case and if we do have this genuine approach, welcome to the real world. Thus my comment earlier that there must be no political interference to frustrate the general commercialisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the decision-makers are prevented from carrying out rationalisation programs, the experiment will fail. Either there is to be management autonomy and responsibility, or there is not. In some cases, it will mean hard decisions. It is something no-one enjoys but, if allowed to proceed unhindered, I believe that it will be in the best interests of this nation, and that is something well overdue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some concerns have been expressed about trust accounts, and these concerns needs to be aired and clarified. Firstly, in respect of the creation of trust accounts, Estimates committees can only scrutinise those amounts of money appropriated from the Budget. It is probable that in the future there may well be no direct Budget appropriations to particular trust accounts within the Department of Administrative Services.
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one would disagree with the proposition that departments should be accountable to the Parliament. If that is agreed-and I seek the Minister's assurance on that-to whom should they be accountable and when? They are the two questions I think we must address. I think it is very important that the questions I am raising here tonight are addressed and determined before next year when we address the Estimates again.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a recent hearing of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, it was the general view of senators that trust accounts should be accountable to the relevant Estimates committee and at the same time as estimates are scrutinised. For instance, it would be totally inappropriate for trust accounts not to be scrutinised before the appropriations are passed in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might also say that it would add to the workload of both this chamber and of people within the departments if we had one Estimates committee which did not scrutinise trust accounts and, subsequently, some other committee that scrutinised them. It can be argued, I suppose, that as the majority of revenue generated for trust accounts comes from other departments, the appropriations can be tracked through those departments. I would submit that this would be a major task and beyond the time and resources of senators on those other committees.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the scrutiny of trust accounts, in the explanatory notes of the 1990-91 estimates of the Department of Administrative Services, there was no detailed information on trust accounts. A simple three-line table gave details of revenue, expenditure and surplus or deficit. The Department, in response to questions, said that with accrual accounting, standard profit and loss balance sheets and explanatory notes, the same as are available in company reports, would be produced. The samples provided as a result of that question were of no value to any senators either at that Committee or any subsequent committee hearing. The examples given indicated revenue sales less cost of sales, gross operating profit less general administrative expenses, an operating profit or a loss and, after subsidies received from the Commonwealth, a final figure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsequently, however, at the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration hearing on 1 November, a proper statement of accounts was provided for the Transport and Storage Group. This was accompanied by a letter from the Australian National Audit Office to Mr McAlister, the executive general manager, Transport and Storage Group, Department of Administrative Services. This was an excellent, first class document. I notice a few congratulatory notes on the covering letter, and I would like to add my congratulations to those responsible for it. But I would appreciate the Minister providing the chamber with a timetable for the provision of similar financial reports for all other trust accounts within the Department of Administrative Services. I think it is vital that such reports are provided. I repeat that what was provided for the Transport and Storage Group was a first class document that should be used as a role model for all other trust accounts within the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to audits, one of the principles for the operation of the Department of Administrative Services on a quasi-commercial basis was that:
       </para>
       <para>
        Service Agencies operating in competition with the private sector should not be subjected to audit or disclosure requirements entailing disclosure of information of potential benefit to competitors.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand-and this was discussed at the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration hearing-that this principle is to be looked at and amended. It is clearly intolerable and would, I imagine, be used as a convenient excuse for non-disclosure. It is hard to envisage a situation where disclosure would be of benefit to a competitor. One of the things one learns in the private sector is that, no matter how hard one tries, there are few secrets when it comes to pricing or, in fact, any other information within a public company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another concern is that of marginal costing. There is concern in the community that fixed costs can be fully paid for by captive clients, thus enabling business to be picked up in the private sector on a marginal cost basis. Examples were given in Estimates committee hearings of this occurring within both the Australian Construction Services and the Australian Government Publishing Service. I seek the Minister's assurance that this will not continue. If it does, it means that other departments, and hence the taxpayers, are funding a corrupted price structure. This is the very principle that we as a nation are fighting to stop in overseas countries where subsidies or high domestic prices are used to dump surplus products on markets where we compete with our rural and mineral products. To make the Australian taxpayer do the same thing for goods or services on our domestic market is even more reprehensible.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, I ask the Minister to assure the Committee that the trust accounts will be subject to scrutiny at normal Estimates committee hearings; to provide a timetable for the provision of financial statements in the same form as that produced by the Transport and Storage Group; to ensure that full disclosure will be provided to the Auditor-General and the Parliament; to ensure that cross-subsidisation will not continue; and to ensure that those responsible for commercialisation through trust accounts will be given the autonomy and responsibility to do so without the political interference which would absolutely frustrate their efforts.

         â€”Senator Parer at the start of his contribution managed to portray the issue that we are facing with this particular part of the Estimates when he mentioned the need to have management autonomy and responsibility to the fullest extent. In respect of this current Estimates process Senator Parer is right. We did, in response to questions by him, produce profit and loss statements on the trust accounts for the Estimates Committee. He also mentioned thereafter the Transport and Storage Group (TSG) section 41 D statement.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In response to Senator Parer's second last question, on full disclosure, disclosure will be made to the Auditor-General. The point, though, that Senator Parer would recognise in the context of commercialisation is that one has to be very sensitive about publicly disclosing information through the audit which would help competitors of the particular organisations involved. That is obviously a matter to keep in mind. There is no intention to keep from the Auditor-General anything but full disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of a time frame for statements similar to the Transport and Storage Group one, that is the only one that has been available in this particular year. The other organisations will be producing similar statements about this time next year, once they have had a full 12 months operation on a commercialised basis. Although the audited statements produced by TSG may not be available in the early stages of Estimates committees, they should be available by this time every financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was another question in respect of cross-subsidisation. As the organisations move on to trust accounts on a commercialised basis, it will be quite patent from the financial records disclosed where organisations are making profits and where they are making losses, and the transparency principle will be applied in that respect.

         â€”I think that I should clarify the matter of cross-subsidisation. What I meant was that with a particular trust account, and I do not mean within the whole of the Department of Administrative Services, I guess the major clients will always be other government departments. To some extent we have captive clients, even though I appreciate the fact that to some degree this is being freed up. But where there are captive clients there is an ability to charge on a monopoly pricing basis. That can pick up, even through an accrual accounting system, all the fixed costs and that then enables branches such as Australian Construction Services and the Australian Property Group to operate on a marginal cost basis to compete in the private sector. A number of examples were given to the Estimates committee where it was claimed that that had been done. So it was not cross-subsidisation across the various sectors within the Department, but within a particular trust account.

         â€”I have just a couple of points in response to that. First of all, as Senator Parer would know but I probably need to restate the point, there are fewer and fewer areas where there are tied client arrangements. Secondly, in respect of commercialisation, which has been proceeding quite substantially over recent years and which will continue to proceed, the transparency of the records and the accounts is the greatest safeguard in terms of protecting competitors of these organisations against subsidisation. When this process is implemented, I think that Senator Parer will find that his fear is not well-founded.

         â€”The other question I would like again to raise relates to the provision of the financial statements produced in much the same form as those of the Transport and Storage Group. As the Minister will be aware, with most commercial organisations under an accrual system figures are produced so that management can see where the company is going on a monthly basis. I am not suggesting that we in the Parliament want to see figures produced on a monthly basis. I was a little disturbed to hear the Minister state that he did not expect the other eight trust accounts to be able to produce their figures in the same form as those produced for Transport and Storage until about this time next year. I hope that we will have those in place by the time we come to the mini-Estimates in March or April next year, if not for the benefit of this Parliament then certainly for the benefit of people who are trying to operate the trust accounts within the Department.

         â€”I accept that Senator Parer is not suggesting that. The Transport and Storage Group (TSG) has already moved much further down the road than the other trust account operations that Senator Parer talked about. As Senator Parer would know, there is also an arrangement whereby the aid organisations have a year's grace to get their systems in place and their accounting systems on a financial basis. That year's grace basically meant that up to the end of the last financial year we worked in a mongrel situation. But at the end of this current financial year the other account organisations will be in the same position as TSG and will be producing the same level of information for auditors as TSG.

I think the Minister quite properly commented-I think the point was also made by the Auditor-General at the meeting on 1 November-that one of the problems might well be that when the normal Estimates committees meet we will not have a complete audit from the Auditor-General. I think that the matter needs support. Perhaps the other Committee needs to report first. In asking this question, I make this plea: notwithstanding the final audit report, is it the Minister's view-it is certainly the view that I am promoting-that when we look at the estimates at the normal time we can also look at the trust accounts rather than have two bites at the cherry?

         â€”I raise a number of issues that have been alluded to by Senator Parer in his reservation about the operation of Australian Construction Services (ACS). I am sure that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) will recall that on 13 September, when these matters were being considered by the Estimates Committee, I pursued a number of questions about the supervision of construction projects during the construction of the Royal Australian Air Force base at Tindal in the Northern Territory. I raised a series of questions relating to the supervision by Australian Construction Services and to possible charges of fraud being brought in these matters. In looking again at the Hansard of 13 September, I accept responsibility for not having been vigilant enough on that occasion to pursue some of my questions, because when I read the answers I find that in a number of places they were only part answered.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        For example, I asked a number of questions which linked the questions of liquidations and bankruptcies of contractors with any suggestion of impropriety in the supervision of the Department. I find that the answers given related to the matters of bankruptcy and liquidation but did not address whether the Department accepted responsibility for the impropriety in the supervision of those very important Tindal contracts. I have ascertained through answers given by the Defence Housing Authority to another Estimates committee that there is an acceptance by the Defence Housing Authority that there were considerable defects inherent in the construction contracts at this particular time, responsibility for which must be sheeted home to Australian Construction Services and its supervision.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, the Defence Housing Authority in its answers indicated that, of course, further action will need to be taken. Considerable expenditure will now be incurred in the future by the Defence Housing Authority, and it alluded to a figure of $2m to repair defects in this financial year. In subsequent questioning in those Estimates, I ascertained that probably considerably more than $2m would be required. The Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, in the committee stage of the appropriations debate also acknowledged that additional funds would have to be found this year to make good many of those defects to the nearly 400 homes which require remedial action to be taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find this particular matter of great concern in that the answers that were given to me on 13 September would almost imply that Australian Construction Services could wipe its hands of any responsibility. Obviously there was a great deal of professional incompetence and contractual mismanagement through this situation, which has now been brought out in the fact that, I understand, a number of fraud cases against officers or former officers of the Department and other employees are currently proceeding.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would therefore ask the Minister to acknowledge the role of Australian Construction Services in having to make good to the Defence Housing Authority and the budget implications for the long term the issues relating to these professional inadequacies. What action is being taken by the Department? In particular, I should like to be acquainted with the work that is taking place within the Department of Administrative Services own fraud control unit. To what extent has that unit been engaged in investigating all of these contracts that are under review? What cooperation is there between the Department's fraud control unit and the Northern Territory police fraud squad? To what extent will disciplinary action be taken against existing officers, or what police prosecutions are intended to be lodged against former officers or contractors, who have been engaged in this very major problem?

         â€”In responding generally to Senator Tambling, the advice from my Department is that the major defect in the project was the failure of tiling, and this does appear to have been an industry-wide problem. As a consequence, the tile manufacturer, I am informed, has provided free replacement products, while the Defence Housing Authority has provided funds to Australian Construction Services (ACS) for other costs of remedial works. ACS has provided and supports some of the component estimates of the $2m claim that Senator Tambling talks about, but we are not in a position to adequately comment upon the actual figure as being accurate.

        One inference that has been drawn is that additional expenditure has run into millions of dollars to rectify the air-conditioning problem.

        I think Senator Tambling referred to impropriety. I am informed that one former member of the Department is currently charged with fraud. That has involved work by the Department's fraud control unit. Officers of the unit have visited Darwin, as Senator Tambling would probably know, and investigated the scene with members of the Defence Housing Authority. I am advised that at this stage only one person is being prosecuted and there are no others under suspicion.

         â€”Very obviously, the brief that was written for the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) was written by Sir Humphrey Appleby. The advice that was given to me here by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, recently acknowledged a much greater extent of problems in that regard. I understand that a number of engineering consultancies have been given to the Defence Housing Authority which do in fact implicate the Australian Construction Services in much more than the $2m defect. Minister Ray acknowledged in this chamber only a week or so ago that where funds would need to be sought they would be provided.

       <para>
        The Minister now acknowledges that there is a minor problem with regard to air-conditioning. Let me inform the Committee that the minor problem that is supposedly put about relates to air-conditioning control units. The fact is that the control unit was designed by Australian Construction Services to operate at a temperature reading in the order of 27 degrees. Anyone knows that for the comfort of an evening in a tropical environment people will want to operate their air-conditioning units at 20 to 22 degrees. Sure, the control units on 300 homes can be changed for $60,000, but that will not stop people turning the units to as low as they can possibly get them and, in effect, then not being able to operate satisfactorily any of the air-conditioning units. The basic problem is a design one that goes much further than that. It means that the homes themselves cannot satisfactorily serve their purpose. This, of course, is sheeted home to the inherent design problem that was put into the buildings by Australian Construction Services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister also acknowledges that there is one fraud case currently continuing, but he does not address the question that I put to him as to how many departmental officers have been disciplined, counselled or transferred within the Department; how many of them have been operating at different branches; and what sort of staff redundancies, changes and redeployments are currently happening within the Department that chase their problem areas back to the Tindal contracts?
       </para>
       <para>
        There are problems not only with the design but also with the contracting areas. The Minister does not acknowledge how many contractors are currently being prosecuted by the fraud squad and for which court cases will start in the very near future that also compromise officers of the Department in this regard. How many contractors are currently under prosecution? I asked the question as to what liaison there had been between the Department's fraud control unit and the fraud squad of the Northern Territory police. How many more cases are pending? How many officers of the Department have been interviewed internally by their own fraud squad or by police officers and have been either subpoenaed or may well be subpoenaed in the near future with regard to these fraud cases? It will obviously be a very messy situation, one that will compromise the Department.

        I am concerned about some other issues that I will raise in a minute with regard to the operation of the regional offices in Darwin and Adelaide and the head office in Canberra. A number of officers seem to be playing with checkerboards with regard to trying to hide and camouflage the problem under many other structural changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like the Minister to address the problems that I have raised with regard to fraud in particular, the number of departmental officers who have been and will be counselled, disciplined and charged in this regard, and what the Department anticipates in the longer term will be its financial obligation to make good comments in the Defence Housing Authority reports that acknowledge obvious major design criteria problems.

       <para>
        With regard to the issue of design of air-conditioners, particularly the 27 to 19 degrees, I think it is most important to point out that the client, the Royal Australian Air Force, is a defence department. Australian Construction Services is the professional arm that provides the professional engineering, architectural and design services. It should have been competent enough to know that one does not design something for 27 degrees even if the client's original design brief specifies such a requirement. It should surely have returned to that client department and advised it professionally and properly that that was inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        This should have been particularly the case if that body had any long term design sympathy or experience in the Northern Territory, as it was supposed to have had. These units were probably designed in Adelaide. The Department continues to follow this practice rather than properly using the professional services that are available to it in the Northern Territory. If it has to it could use the private sector. However, this seems to be anathema to the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        That brings me to the other point that I wanted to address. I refer to the regional office reorganisation and restructuring between the Department in Darwin and Adelaide that has taken place recently. I ask the Minister to acknowledge that the Department and the Australian Construction Services have recently distributed a document headed Principles for Co-operation between Northern Territory and South Australia. This document sets out the relationships between the South Australian and Northern Territory regions and the way in which they will operate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why in such a document would it be acknowledged that the South Australian region will be the preferred agent for the Northern Territory region? Why is there no acknowledgment in an internal departmental document of any contribution that could be made by the private sector-professional engineers, architects, quantity surveyors, survey draftsmen-any of the people who are obviously well established, well entrenched, within the commercial environment of the Northern Territory, and why instead would there be a client preference given to South Australia to undertake this work? I can only presume it is because the Department has more of its own officers sitting on their backsides in the Adelaide office with nothing to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would be very interested if the Minister could provide a list of the amount of work, however he measures it-whether it is by money value or works program-that is undertaken by the South Australian region within the South Australian office for the South Australian constituency, as opposed to what those officers in South Australia do for the Northern Territory constituency. I would bet-I would take a bet very gladly with the Minister on this-that the amount of work that is done for the Northern Territory by Adelaide is out of all kilter compared with anything that can be done in South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have only to look at the major civil works programs of recent years-whether it is Tindal, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment or the naval base at HMAS Coonawarra. All those major projects which should have been carried out in the Northern Territory, utilising the resources of engineering, architectural and other professional services in the Northern Territory, have in effect been transferred to prop up an inefficient and costly exercise of the Department in South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The document headed Principles for co-operation between Northern Territory and South Australia mentions several things that have to be covered. Among them, it says :
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that the Regional Managers in the NT are adequately informed so that they can deal with political and media queries.
       </para>
       <para>
        That sort of acknowledgment was put in. Maybe the journalists or politicians of the Northern Territory will be asking questions and therefore the regional managers must be adequately informed, but there is no relationship whatsoever with the professional organisations, with the people who are qualified and competent in the community to carry out the particular works. I would like the Minister to tell us why, in this regional reorganisation of the Department, it has to be acknowledged that there has to be a works transfer to his own State of South Australia. I would hope that there are no implications that since he assumed this important portfolio more work has been transferred than was necessary.

         â€”I have just a couple of points in response to Senator Tambling. Senator Parer probably understands, as do others, that we are going through a transition period with the Australian Construction Services (ACS). There is-and it has been signalled-a fair degree of downsizing of the organisation. In those circumstances one has to share out the work, particularly in the transition period. Honourable senators will understand that downsizing cannot be done quickly. I ask Senator Tambling to note that, for example, the contracting work for HMAS Coonawarra has been let out to Northern Territory contractors and we are further advised that Northern Territory consultants are used where they are cost effective.

       <para>
        With respect to the statement of principles, I think once again it is best for us to look at those overnight and see whether there is anything further I can add. The principle that it is important that regional managers be well informed in order to handle political and media queries, of course, does not have to imply what Senator Tambling indicates it implies. I think that is a long bow to draw. Politicians throughout the country often go to ACS with a wide range of inquiries. I, for one, do not want a continuation of the situation where I put down the telephone and am frustrated at the lack of information that I might obtain. Likewise, I think the media also has a right to know as much as is possible. To that extent, well informed regional managers can satisfy inquiries immediately.

         â€”The last issue that I wish to raise with regard to Australian Construction Services is also related to the reorganisation of office structures. I wish to inquire as to what extent there is a redeployment of staff going on between various offices and the extent to which this redeployment is in effect discriminating against any officers of long standing at particular regional offices. Has the redeployment of any officers in fact impinged on personnel who have been involved with the Tindal contracts, of which I was so critical earlier? Various officers involved with the Tindal contracts have moved in and out of the Department and in and out of branches of the Department interstate, and there are those who have perhaps left the Department to avoid prosecution for fraud and other matters. Has there been any relationship between these people and officers who are currently under threat of redeployment or redundancy?

        I am certainly seeking information and assurances that officers of the Department, who are located in the Northern Territory, who wish to remain there and who have the professional competency to do so, are not being transferred at a time when very obviously the South Australian office is not giving the same sort of extension of abilities to other employees at that particular office. I want to be assured that all officers are being dealt with properly and that there are no suggestions of any impropriety concerning any officers of the Department who are currently facing redeployment or redundancy packages.

         â€”I think there is a basic principle that would suffice to answer Senator Tambling's question. Officers are being encouraged to relocate and to be redeployed. I think Senator Tambling would understand that in some areas that is easy but in technical and professional skilled areas, for instance, it becomes a bit more difficult.

        In respect of the Tindal aspect of the matter, I do not think that necessarily impinges on this particular issue. But I reiterate that the fraud control unit of the Department has been involved in investigating this particular issue. I think it is fair to say that if there is any evidence against any current or former employee-as has been instanced by the case that I mentioned earlier-we will not be tardy in pursuing those allegations and investigating them fully.

         â€”I would like to refer to the reservations that I put into the Committee report. The item to which I wish to refer concerns the tender for the uninterrupted power supply for the Department of Social Security (DSS) office park at Tuggeranong. This was raised in Estimates committee hearings and put into the report as a reservation because the replies to the questions took a long time to come. But even so, the responses themselves left a lot to be desired. The background to this matter was that the DSS office park at Tuggeranong was being constructed by Civil and Civic Pty Ltd and, as part of that construction, tenders were requested for an uninterrupted power supply.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When the ordinary power supply fails this uninterrupted power supply (UPS) will come into play and stop a whole lot of awful things happening such as, I suppose, the computer programs being lost. The problem was that Civil and Civic went to tender for the components for this contract and the successful tenderer was supposedly a company called Liebert Corporation Australia Pty Ltd. After it was advised by Civil and Civic that it had been successful, it was subsequently advised that another company-a company called Thycon Systems Pty Ltd-had received the tender. When I raised the matter in the Estimates Committee the response I got was amazing. Firstly, the officers of the Department of Administrative Services said they believed that it was not an Australian Construction Service (ACS) project. In response to a question I asked, Mr Setchell said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not our project at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pursued the matter and Mr Woonton said:
       </para>
       <para>
        That surprises me. We may have been advising the Australian Property Group, which has an arrangement with Civil and Civic.
       </para>
       <para>
        On three occasions officers answered that the ACS really had no role in the construction of the building and had nothing to do with it. The Managing Director of Liebert wrote a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and I told the Estimates Committee where it could get the letter-indicating that he suspected there had been some interference in the tendering process. These are fairly serious allegations. Subsequently, the Department responded that ACS was not aware of any personal involvement by the Prime Minister in the process relating to the awarding of the UPS tender-although Thycon Systems Pty Ltd is located in the Prime Minister's electorate of Wills-and that Civil and Civic initially recommended the Liebert unit. The basis of the recommendation was that it offered increased load capacity and a five degree higher operating temperature.
       </para>
       <para>
        Civil and Civic also advised the Department of Social Security (DSS) of its recommendation of 13 July that the cost difference was negligible between the two offers. Civil and Civic verbally advised the Australian Property Group on 18 September that the tender prices received were-and these are the prices given to me-Liebert, $365,250, and Thycon, $366,808. The prices were very close. The information given by Civil and Civic to DSS on 13 July was simply that both were suitable tenders, that the price difference was negligible and that neither company offered 100 per cent Australian manufacture, the difference being approximately 15 to 20 per cent in favour of Thycon.
       </para>
       <para>
        This smells of interference. The job was given; the company responsible was Civil and Civic; and, as I mentioned earlier, on the three occasions I first raised this in the Estimates Committee the officials denied any knowledge of it. On subsequent pursuit they indicated they were acting in an advisory role. I ask some additional questions on this matter. Why was the Australian content raised as an issue when the Liebert equipment was considered technically superior by Civil and Civic, the main contractor? Who instructed or suggested to Thycon that it should manufacture a unit with an 800 KVA capacity at 45 degree centigrade ambient? Why was it given the opportunity to do so after the tenders had closed? Was any response ever forthcoming from the Prime Minister or his Department about the concerns raised by the Managing Director of Liebert in his letter to the Prime Minister?

In the response given to me to the questions on notice it was stated that Civil and Civic, which was responsible, initially recommended the Liebert unit and the basis of that was that it offered increased load capacity. Following my question, Civil and Civic verbally advised the Australian Property Group (APG) of the prices that had been received. Somewhere in the middle of all this-Civil and Civic being the main contractor responsible for this, with APG and Australian Construction Services overseeing the purchase of equipment-someone instructed Civil and Civic not to go along with its own recommendation but to switch to another tenderer. What was the basis of that? Who initiated it, and for what reason?

Australian Construction Services (ACS) did not make known to Thycon any information relating to the Liebert tender. ACS has not seen tenders from either company and did not discuss the tenders with Civil and Civic. ACS is not aware of any information on the Liebert tender being made known to Thycon or of any tender process having been interfered with. That is worth repeating. I think it is also worth repeating that we are talking about a contract to Civil and Civic whereby it would make its own decision. It has already been indicated that the question of Australian content was put to Civil and Civic by ACS and was obviously in the contract.

         â€”The problem is that some illogical comments are made in the response given to the question on notice. One was that Civil and Civic initially recommended the Liebert tender. Liebert had offered an increased capacity unit with the price differential being within a few dollars; there was very little in it. It offered a piece of equipment that had an increased capacity.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Subsequently, with Civil and Civic itself being responsible-and this is the one it recommended-someone intervened. The opposition tenderer suddenly found that, if he could match the technical speci- fication that was offered by the successful tenderer, he had a chance of winning. It is not just a matter of Australian manufacture-that was not the point-there is another reason why that occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I am trying to do is flesh out the real background to this. As the Minister responded-and I know that he is acting on the advice of some of the departmental officials and did not make the decision himself in this instance-someone intervened to ensure that the original requirement by the main contractor was changed. To do that, information had to be given to the initially unsuccessful tenderer to enable him to lift his specification to that of the initially successful tenderer.

The point is, as has been indicated already, that Senator Parer is talking about Civil and Civic making a decision and, as already advised, the Australian Construction Services (ACS) has indicated that it was not involved in any redirection of the tender.

         â€”I will go on to a couple more reservations. I will touch very briefly on my reservation on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The cost to the taxpayer of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody highlights the need for a clear and sensible policy on the appointment of royal commissions. Since the Estimates hearings, the Premier of Queensland has agreed to the extension of the Royal Commission for another three months, thereby adding to the further costs and time overrun. The original budget of $2.2m is now projected to be of $30m.

        When the Commission was set up in October 1987, its final report was due in December 1988. Its original staff numbered twelve, but by September this year, it had grown to 151. The second date for finalisation was 30 December 1990, with the final report by 31 December 1990. As one will appreciate from reading the press, Aboriginal leaders have described the Commission-to use the terms of Mr Bob Weatherall-as a picnic for white lawyers. They said that the $10m which had been spent in Queensland so far had been a waste. Mr Charles Perkins, who would be well known to honourable senators, has the view that examining the underlying causes was a lot of rubbish. `They know exactly what the underlying causes are', he said. I ask: why is not possible for commissioners to be engaged on an annual contract, rather than paid on daily rates? Why is it necessary to increase the staff of the Commission so dramatically? Will there need to be a further extension of time before the Commission is able to finalise its business?

Of course, that has consequent flow-on effects.

         â€”I want to raise another matter and to make some comments about parliamentarians' entitlements and facilities, which were the subject of a reservation by Senator Parer in Estimates Committee D. Senator Parer and Senator Kemp in particular asked questions during the Estimates Committee hearings. I refer to the issue of the postage allowances for members of parliament which were announced by the Government in August 1989.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To refresh the Committee's memory of those events, it was in August 1989 that the then Minister for Administrative Services suddenly and without any prior notice announced that postal entitlements for members of the House of Representatives would become $30,525 annually. That was a 3 1/2 fold increase from the previous level of $9,000. That decision did not come as a result of any Remuneration Tribunal recommendation-indeed, the Remuneration Tribunal had, shortly before then, recommended the $9,000 figure; instead, it came from an arbitrary political decision taken by the Executive Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition, as the Committee will recall, through the then shadow Attorney-General, Neil Brown, QC, took the Government's decision to the High Court, which subsequently found that the moneys were illegally paid by the Government, contrary to the Constitution. The Government has never attempted to recover those moneys illegally paid, despite offers by at least two members of parliament to repay the amounts they spent over and above their $9,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one exception to that: on 3 May the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) directed members of parliament to cease spending from the additional allowance. Despite the fact that members and senators may have been asked to repay expenditure after 3 May, no information is available as to whether they did. In any event, that related to payments after the High Court decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very briefly, that is the history of the subject. The matter is still in the courts, with the then shadow Attorney-General, now shadow Minister for transport and communications, Mr Brown, and Senator Parer having taken further action. The legal aspects of this matter will be dealt with in the Committee debate by Senator Durack in particular.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was very surprised that the Government took so long to release the Solicitor-General's report on which the decision not to recover-not even to attempt to recover-the amounts that had been illegally paid out was apparently based. The Opposition has always opposed the Government's extraordinary, quite bizarre, blatantly extravagant political and high-handed action in making the increases in the first place. We unhesitatingly decided to test the legality of the Government's action. That resulted in the final decision by the High Court to declare the payments illegal and invalid according to the Constitution. At the time, the then Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Peacock, wrote to coalition members asking them not to spend the increase until the legal position had been resolved. It was the coalition's action that led to the High Court decision which found the payments unlawful.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were various aspects about that High Court decision which were very important. I think it is essentially important to note the statement in the High Court decision concerning the basic constitutional issue and the basic constitutional principle that was involved in all of this. That decision stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . no money can be taken out of the Consolidated Fund into which the revenues of the state have been paid, excepting under a distinct authorisation from Parliament itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's action in fact contravened section 83 of the Constitution. That section states:
       </para>
       <para>
        No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's decision was obviously-and found by the High Court to be so-contrary to that basic principle and, indeed, that section of the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The significance of the Government's action is quite profound. It is not the quantity of money involved that is the problem-I will come back to that later in my remarks-but rather the way that the Government is now attempting to get away with what was deemed by the High Court to be an illegal action by virtue of a deliberate non-decision not to recover the funds that were paid out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let it be quite clear; everyone knows it: the 3 1/2-fold increase in the postage allowance, from $9,000 to $30,500 a year for members of the House of Representatives, not for senators, came about for one reason only-to allow the many Labor members of parliament in the House of Representatives, particularly those in highly marginal seats, to rort the public purse in a desperate bid to retain their seats at the recent Federal election. The Australian taxpayer is now being asked to meet the cost of that political rort.

        An editorial appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald shortly after the coalition announced that it was going to take the action that we are now proposing to take tonight, and which I foreshadowed in my speech in the second reading debate on the appropriation Bills. Let me quote some parts of that editorial:

        The Federal Government and the Democrats-
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        have not emerged with any credit from the row about the illegal expenditure on postal allowances by MPs during the last election campaign...The Federal Government, which benefited significantly from the increased allowances, has consistently refused to accept any responsibility for what was done. The Democrats, by dismissing the Opposition's continuing concern over the matter as a case of ``flogging a dead horse'', have made a mockery of Don Chipp's instruction that their task in Canberra is ``to keep the bastards honest''.

         â€”If Senator McLean listened-and if he and members of his Party, including his present leader, Senator Powell, had a bit of consistency in the way they voted in May this year-he might regret having said those words. The editorial continues:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        According to the Democrat Leader, Senator Powell, the issue is not of great economic or social importance. But this can only be true if it is a matter of no importance to politicians or the public when MPs act in defiance of the law. Senator Powell, it seems, is confusing the amount of money involved with the gravity of the principle involved. It must always be a matter of concern, surely, when MPs are allowed by the Government to rort the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        If time permits, later in my remarks I will come back to some of those points. The editorial concludes by making the following remarks:
       </para>
       <para>
        It's about time, too, that the Federal Government acknowledged it has mishandled the issue. Instead of ensuring that repayments are never made-
       </para>
       <para>
        and that is what this is about-
       </para>
       <para>
        it should be encouraging those of its MPs who spent their allowances to pay the money back. There is an issue of political integrity involved here. How can the Federal Government expect people to respond to its calls for restraint in spending when it allows MPs to spend money to which they had no legal right?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is basically for that reason that I, on behalf of the Opposition, circulated in the chamber yesterday an amendment to be moved to the motion that the report of Estimates Committee D be adopted. The coalition moves the following amendment:
       </para>
       <para>
        At end of motion, add:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``, subject to the following request for amendment to the House of Representatives: That the House of Representatives be requested to amend the Bill by reducing the vote for the Department of Administrative Services by $1,028,596, because of the decision to write off as irrecoverable money which the High Court has ruled was unlawfully paid out as postage entitlement for certain members of the Parliament.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        No wonder the electorate has become despairingly cynical of the hopeless, politically and morally corrupt Government which is in power in this country when it has engaged in this sort of totally unprincipled behaviour. The coalition's actions may be seen by some as purely symbolic because $1m is a small amount of money when taken in the context of annual government expenditure of more than $90,000m, but a million dollars to most people is a lot of money, particularly in the recessed Australian economy of today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's economy is recessed as a result of the policies of this Government-a government which says that average Australians must pull in their belts and accept lower living standards while still paying exorbitant levels of taxation to a government which spends without inhibition, even if this spending is illegal and unconstitutional, as is the case in this instance.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is much more than symbolism. What is at stake here is a basic issue of principle. The Government has shown its true colours in this matter. It ignores principle. It regards itself as outside the law and the Constitution. That is what the Government is doing. It pays no regard to the basic rights of taxpayers who expect their government only to spend their taxpayers' dollars legally. The Government quite obviously is beyond redemption on this matter, but the Australian Democrats may not be-although, given Senator McLean's comments, that appears not to be the case. Several Democrats, including the now leader, Senator Powell, supported the coalition in May by throwing out a disgraceful Bill designed to circumvent the decision of the High Court of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would urge the Democrats to support the coalition again, as they did in May, in this matter of principle concerning legal and political morality. But if the Democrats in fact support the Government by opposing the amendment, then they will have to bear the consequences-and the consequences will be very far reaching, because it will mean that the Democrats' much vaunted cry of `We'll keep the bastards honest' means nothing whatsoever. They will stand condemned by their own actions before the electorate because this matter is about honesty. The Government has acted dishonestly, and it has acted illegally.

The honourable senator cannot associate himself with this sort of chicanery, even though he did in 1975-and we all remember that. But as I say, it was a joke from the announcement-a joke because, having made that grand decision, they went out and someone said, `Well, you've got to stop the Supply Bills, but have you got the numbers?' And what did they say? `We haven't thought of that; we haven't asked the Democrats yet.' It was a cheap trick from the first moment it was raised in their party room a few weeks ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, having made that decision, they went out and announced to the world that they would stop a Supply Bill but not stop Supply. Of course Dr Hewson, not able to understand the implications of what he was doing, had his staff running around to members of the press gallery explaining to them legal technicalities that they, his staffers, had no idea about, let alone himself. They were sprung when Senator Powell said, `Well, we see this as flogging a dead horse'-and that is precisely what they are doing tonight.

        We have continuation again; the Opposition knows that it has not got the numbers. It knows, because of intervening effects, that it is not looking all that good on this particular issue. But having committed itself to going down this track, to going over the hill, with this particular issue, the Opposition does not know when to stop. If anyone out in the community wants any proof about how marginalised the Opposition in this place is and how irrelevant it is to the critical debate of this country--

Another example is when the Opposition came up with this decision. The Opposition knows full well that we have had advice from the Solicitor-General that payments made in excess of the $9,000 entitlement are irrecoverable either from Australia Post or from individual senators or members. The Opposition also knows full well that Senator Parer and the relentless Mr Neil Brown-who seems to be moonlighting as a politician and working full time as a lawyer these days-have exercised their rights fairly under section 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act to review the decision with the Secretary to my Department to write off the overpayments.

        On the political level I return to the big issues facing this country. Let us remember that the Opposition allowed this country to stagnate for years by not being able to face up to a decision. The Opposition goes into its party room now wanting to slash billions off government spending but not being able to cut back $37m. The Opposition had no guts at all to face the big issues in the 1960s, the 1970s or the 1980s, or even now. We have the politics of recycling in this place with Dr Hewson's economic policies. We have now the ghosts of 1975. Senator Durack thought it was a great idea in 1975, which worked for the Opposition, but it was not being led by a mug then. Whatever is said about Malcolm Fraser, he had the brains and the plans, and he put them into effect. But Opposition senators are amateurs compared to even Malcolm Fraser. Senator Hill can sit back there and laugh-he does that pretty well, and we all enjoy it-but the reality is that we are talking about serious issues facing this country.

         â€”We have in Australia something like 90 years of Commonwealth Law Reports. If one were to look at those law reports, one would find time and time again cases where individuals, corporations and States have challenged governments and challenged each other. The basis of those challenges has been the question of whether governments have had the power or authority, or have acted properly in exercising whatever power or authority they have had, in implementing legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not need to recite other cases but it is a fair point to make that the court system is in place to adjudicate on the power of the States and of the Commonwealth and to protect the rights of individuals, particularly as we have in Australia a Constitution which provides for a separation of powers. The High Court of Australia has often been called upon to decide whether governments have acted within their constitutional or legal authority or otherwise. Courts have also made decisions, and have been asked to make decisions, on whether governments, in pursuance of validly passed legislation, have acted properly or ultra vires. They have also been asked to make decisions about whether regulations are in accordance with either the legislation in question or the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this situation the High Court was asked to give a ruling on whether the Government's decision in 1989 was within the authority of the Government to make. It is a question that has been asked of the High Court consistently over its years of existence-asked of any court, State or Federal-about the exercise of power of any government. The point I make is that what the High Court did here was something that it has done quite often in other cases. As a consequence, we have a situation where the postage entitlement was reduced quite substantially.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another thing that Senator Short appears to forget to mention is that I sought advice from the relevant legal officers and got advice from the Australian Solicitor-General. The advice I sought was whether we could recoup the excess payments. As I have already indicated a number of times, both by press statement and in this place, the Solicitor-General has advised that payments made in excess of the $9,000 entitlement for the provision of postal items of service are recoverable either from Australia Post or from individual senators or members.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, as late as tonight I went on to recognise that that decision, or a write-off consequent upon that advice, has been challenged under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of 1977. It has been challenged by Senator Parer and Mr N.A. Brown. As a legal issue, therefore, it still has currency. As it is a legal issue with currency, I obviously have a responsibility not to comment further upon it, and I have made that clear already. In the context of its being a political issue, I offered my advice a little earlier, and I do it again, that, given the fact that we have had that advice; given that the Australian Democrats have indicated that they see Senator Short's pursuing this particular matter as flogging a dead horse and that he does not have the numbers; given the embarrassment I would have anticipated in the honourable senator bringing this matter up at this particular time, in light of the allegations--

         â€”I briefly want to add a few remarks to those I made last night about the lack of funding for the Canberra City Opera. I have received a note under the heading, `Opera ACT', which claims that I had uttered a disgraceful lie and said something unbecoming of an experienced public figure like myself. I am reported in Hansard as saying that Opera ACT did get a grant of $50,000 to produce one production, Tosca, for three nights while the Canberra City Opera, which produces a whole range of productions over many days, got nothing. I said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . its productions-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the Opera ACT productions-
       </para>
       <para>
        usually are largely made up of people who come from outside the ACT area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, that word `people' should have been `principals'. The chorus, the orchestra and all those other groups come from local people. In fact, many of them are the people who are being trained by the Canberra City Opera in its regular chorus work, which is kept going throughout the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        If Opera ACT is upset by the fact by the word `people' was accidentally used instead of `principals', I apologise to it. Frankly, if that is all it has to whinge about, it is doing pretty well. The facts are that Opera ACT has relied heavily on principals and people like the musical director and producer who come from outside Canberra. Those who are used from inside Canberra for principal roles are generally the same people year after year. The Canberra City Opera has new talent all the time, as is natural from a company which is providing opportunities for young graduates from the Canberra School of Music. These young people are coming through the Canberra City Opera and are then going to the leading opera houses of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, my `correction' of a wrong word, where the import was clearly evident anyway, gives me the opportunity to note that in effect there are not really two opera companies in Canberra. When the appropriate Minister, Mr Gary Humphries, says that it would be impossible for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Administration to fund two opera companies, he is clearly missing the point. Apart from the fact that if it is good enough to fund two choirs, two theatrical companies and two of quite a few different artistic areas in the ACT, his logic is not too good.
       </para>
       <para>
        But his facts are even worse. Opera ACT, to which he has given $50,000, is not in fact a continuing company in the ACT. It is not an opera company in the generally accepted use of the word. It is an organisation which springs into life, at this stage once a year, to provide one operatic production by drawing on people from within Canberra-as I said, if they are local principals, they are basically the same people every year-and people from outside. That is not a continuing company. It is even funded on a project basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the ACT Administration list of successful project grant recipients Opera ACT is listed as having received $50,000. The Canberra City Opera is a continuing company. It is in constant rehearsal. It provides opportunities all the time for people coming through. It is certainly not a once-off situation. It is ready to provide at instant notice a chorus, for example, like the one that was provided as a very dramatic backing to the Tiananmen Square massacre service that was held in the Great Hall of Parliament House. Because it is a continuing company it can provide that kind of chorus and singing work all the year round, and is providing a continuing service to the people of Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that if it is Mr Humphries's view that he can fund only one company there is only one company to fund, and that is the Canberra City Opera. I have been very disappointed with the nature of the response that I have had today from Opera ACT and the nature of Mr Humphries's response. His view is that Federal politicians have a hide to complain about the Canberra City Opera not getting any money; after all, it is the Federal Government which has cut funds to the ACT. I remind Mr Humphries that even when funds were not cut the ACT Administration has never given a grant to the Canberra City Opera.
       </para>
       <para>
        Talking about the word `grant', I should mention that, appropriately enough, two of the people who have complained to me from Opera ACT are named Grant. What appropriate names!

       Five members of the ADF, either on loan or exchange with the PNGDF have made visits to Bougainville Island in the course of their duties. These personnel provided specialist technical assistance to the PNG security forces but did not participate in any security force operations. The Australian High Commission in Port Moresby maintained a consular presence on Bougainville during the period of the security forces' operations against the militants. Members of the Australian Defence Staff attached to the High Commission were involved in this activity in their capacity as diplomatically accredited representatives of the Australian Government.
