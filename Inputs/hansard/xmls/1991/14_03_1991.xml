       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned shows that there is widespread community concern over the introduction of competition into Australia's telecommunications industry, and that ordinary consumers may be faced with higher prices and reduced services as a result. In particular, we are concerned about the impact on the affordability of telephone services for low income earners and rural consumers.

        —by leave-I am giving notice today because such notices must be given within 15 sitting days. The Committee is concerned that one of these instruments relates to defective drafting, possible invalid subdelegation, absence of review rights and a misleading explanatory statement. Other apparent defects are a possibly harsh penalty, a strict liability offence, mandatory provisions with unclear effect and possible lack of protection for Commonwealth revenue. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the usual short statement of the matters raised by the Committee in respect of these instruments.

       STATUTORY RULES 1990 N0.422
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) licenses exporters of fruit under provisions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and regulations made under the Act. The Explanatory Statement for the Regulations advises that they will increase the simplicity, flexibility and objectivity of the export licensing procedures of the AHC.
      </para>
      <para>
       Perhaps the most important provision of the Regulations contained a typographical error. The Committee does not usually draw attention to such errors, unless they affect the sense of a provision or unless there are other matters which the Committee wishes to raise. However, in this case the substance of the regulation could have been affected. The Regulations also misspell the name of a friendly Pacific region country.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another regulation provided for the AHC to charge such fees as it considers necessary to enable it to recover costs. It is possible that this is an invalid subdelegation of the power in the parent Act to make regulations with respect to fees. The Committee always carefully scrutinies any apparent unauthorised subdelegation. The Committee on 29 November 1990 presented a Report to the Senate on Subdelegation of Powers.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, the fees did not appear to be subject to gazettal, tabling, disallowance or any other form of parliamentary scrutiny. Here again the Committee is also particularly vigilant. In the present case the fees relate to charges by a statutory authority on individuals earning a livelihood in the export of horticultural products and the Committee would normally expect that such fees be subject to scrutiny.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Regulations provide a right of review to the AAT for a number of discretions. However, there are several important discretions with commercial and livelihood implications which do not appear to have such a right. These include the determination of financial rating for a licensee, decisions on reasons for failure to comply with certain conditions of a licence and a failure by the AHC to approve credit assessors.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Explanatory Statement is defective in that it does not provide an explanation of the various clauses in the Regulations. More importantly, the Explanatory Statement advises that the Regulations may be extended to cover horticultural products listed in a Schedule. However, this does not appear to be possible under present provisions. Again, the Explanatory Statement advises that licences are not required for some destinations listed in a Schedule, although such a Schedule neither exists nor apparently is provided for in the Regulations.
      </para>

      <para>
       STATUTORY RULES 1991 NO.10
      </para>
      <para>
       These Regulations, made under the parent Australian National Maritime Museum Act 1990, provide for security, control of access and commercial activities in relation to the Museum.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are 10 offence provisions in the Regulations, each of which provides for a penalty of $500. This penalty in most cases appears appropriate, relating to offences such as unauthorised exploitation of Museum material, sale of liquor to persons under 18 years, interfering with exhibits and similar type activities. However, one provision appears to impose a $500 penalty for a parking offence. The Committee is concerned that penalties for offences should be set at an appropriate level. A penalty which is out of proportion to the offence committed may be a breach of personal liberties. In the present case it appears as if the wilful destruction of a valuable relic of Australia's maritime heritage may attract the same penalty as failing to park a motor vehicle in accordance with the directions of a security officer. Such a level of penalty may well be appropriate but the Committee has sought the advice of the Minister.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Regulations further provide that a person must not, without consent, make, print, publish or sell any replica, photograph, or copy of any maritime historical material in the ownership or possession of the Museum. As it stands this is a strict liability offence. As this material is by definition historical, it is possible and even probable that copies of photographs and other documents are in existence outside the Museum. It would therefore seem possible for a person quite innocently to reproduce or publish such material without knowing that he or she was breaching the Regulations. There is no defence provided for such a situation. The Committee always looks closely at strict liability offences and raises the matter with the Minister. The Committee only accepts strict liability provisions after full explanation. In this case it would seem appropriate to amend the Regulations to provide a defence of knowingly breaching the regulation.

      <para>
       These Regulations effect new arrangements for the collection of levies and charges imposed under a number of Acts. These arrangements are intended to provide a more equitable division of payments between industry sectors by clarifying the relative contributions of each sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Regulations provide a penalty of $3,000 for a person who fails to make certain records and prepare accounts. However, there are other mandatory provisions which do not appear to attract a penalty. These provisions require the payment of levies and charges, require a person to provide information to the Secretary and require a statement to be given to a processor. The Committee has written to the Minister asking whether it was intended that there should be penalties for a breach of these provisions. In particular the Committee wishes to know whether there are penalties for failure to comply with the mandatory requirements prescribed in the Regulations for the payment of revenue owing to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee appreciates that penalties may be provided elsewhere for these apparent offences, such as in the parent Act or in other Acts. If this is the position then the Committee believes that penalties should preferably be explained in a note in the instrument itself, as has been done in a number of recent instruments. At the least, such penalties should be set out in the Explanatory Statement. It may be a breach of personal liberties for delegated legislation to include offence provisions with no clear indication either on the face of the instrument or in the Explanatory Statement that a penalty exists.

      <para>
       These regulations give effect to a resolution of the Australian Police Ministers Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Regulations prohibit absolutely the importation of all firearms, including copies of military style firearms, apart from certain exemptions. Some of these exemptions are expressly provided, such as recreational rifles and shotguns, which are defined in detail, and stapling guns, flare guns, tranquilliser guns and similar devices. However, with respect to handguns there are no defined exemptions. Instead, the only exemption provided is a statement in an approved form by or on behalf of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or of the police force of a State or Territory that there is no objection to the importation by that importer of the handgun.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are no criteria to guide and control a Commissioner in the exercise of this discretion to refuse the importation of handguns. More importantly, neither the instrument itself nor the accompanying Explanatory Statement advises whether there is a right of AAT review of an adverse decision.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee appreciates that this is an important and sensitive area. Nevertheless, in any case such as the present where there is an open-ended discretion with a public official which may affect a person's livelihood, or even affect the leisure or recreation of individuals, then it is usually appropriate that external independent review is available.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the present case there is the additional consideration that the instrument confers discretions not only on the Commissioner of the AFP, but also on State and Territory Commissioners, who are not Commonwealth officials.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its letter to the Minister the Committee foreshadowed that it might write again on the effect of operation of the instrument. Although the formal date of effect of the regulations is the date of gazettal, there is the question of the effect on prohibited guns which may have been in transit to Australia or waiting to be unloaded at an Australian port at the date of gazettal.

       <para in-line="1">
        —by leave-I wish briefly to present to the Parliament the reasons for this action and why the Australian Democrats are sincerely hopeful that the coalition will join with us in this action. I will move to disallow regulations 5, 61, 63, 68, 71, 82, 85, 88 and 95 of the Austudy regulations.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Regulation 5 is concerned with the age limit on eligibility for Austudy. We will seek to disallow that because we believe it should be changed from 16 years to 15 years of age or starting in year 11, the relevant year of study, to remove discrepancies between the States.
      </para>
      <para>
       Regulation 61 concerns Austudy living allowance, which is still less than the unemployment benefit for students over 21. From January 1991, regulation 63, which concerns the special rate of benefit for people who have been unemployed for six out of the last nine months and who transfer over to Austudy, will no longer apply to a married person with no children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Regulation 68, which relates to the qualification for the independent living allowance on the basis of age, we believe should be reduced from 25 years of age to the normal legal age of adulthood, which is 18 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Regulation 71 concerns the qualification for the independent living allowance on the basis of periods in the work force. Presently this must be full time employment for three out of the last four years. We believe this should be decreased to two years out of the last three years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Regulation 82 concerns the personal income test, which is currently $4,000 and includes income earned during the long vacation. We believe this should be increased and, depending on the new threshold, should exclude pay over the long vacation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to regulation 85, under the Budget changes this year a step-parent who is normally in the same house has his or her income and assets taken into account in assessing a stepchild for Austudy. It might seem logical to assume that a step-parent contributes directly or indirectly to a stepchild's study and living expenses. However, it is inappropriate to infer an imposition of that sort and, therefore, impose an obligation as a result when a step-parent does not normally have any legal or financial obligation toward the stepchild.
      </para>
      <para>
       Regulation 88 is a parental income test of $19,300, which is far too severe compared with average earnings in Australia in August 1990 of $29,260. Regulation 95 concerns a spouse income test where the threshold has been reduced to $12,150 from the previous $18,150, which is less than the poverty line for a couple with no children.

        The speech read as follows-

       <para>
        This Bill gives effect to the Government's pledge to work towards prohibiting mining in Antarctica. On 17 August 1990 the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade announced the Government's decision to introduce legislation to ban all mining in Antarctica to the extent of Australia's legal capacity to apply such a ban. This Bill achieves that objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will prohibit minerals activity in the Australian Antarctic Territory, and will prohibit Australian nationals and corporations from undertaking minerals activities elsewhere in the Antarctic region. The Bill is a first key step towards achieving our objective of comprehensive and legally binding protection of the Antarctic environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Antarctic environment is unique. It represents the world's greatest pristine wilderness. The processes of nature are still taking their course largely unaffected by mankind. The Antarctic is not isolated, however. It is fundamentally linked to the global environment through, for example, complex interactions in the global atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Pollutants generated elsewhere in the world are now detectable in Antarctica. The rapid growth in recent years in countries wishing to be present in Antarctica has also brought additional stresses on the environment. But these impacts are negligible compared to the potential damage that could be caused by minerals exploration and development.
       </para>
       <para>
        Antarctica is portrayed as a harsh place. But the delicate balance of life forms show that despite Antarctica's harsh image the environment is exquisitely beautiful and fragile. The scientific work that has been done in Antarctica over many years, in which Australians have taken a lead role, show that Antarctica still has much to teach us. The Government firmly believes that Antarctica's extraordinary environmental and scientific values must not be put at risk. Thus Australia, together with France, Belgium and Italy, is asking the Antarctic Treaty parties to agree on a means for permanently protecting Antarctica by declaring it a Nature Reserve, and a Land of Science.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to report that Australia is making progress towards its objective of securing the agreement of its Antarctic Treaty partners to a new legal instrument that will achieve effective protection of Antarctica. The recent Antarctic Treaty Special Consultative Meeting in Chile saw encouraging movement towards our objectives. A significant number of countries are now supporting the thrust of our proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will assist in achieving a prohibition on all mining and related activities in Antarctica by banning mining, by Australians and nonAustralians alike, in the Australian Antarctic Territory. This is some 42% of the Antarctic continent. In addition, the legislation will prohibit Australian nationals and corporations from engaging in mining activity elsewhere in Antarctica.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill recognises the need to allow for activities in support of scientific work. The legislation is targeted at commercial minerals activity and has been drafted so as not apply to scientific research and building and maintenance activities in support of scientific stations. The Government recognises the importance of Antarctica for scientific research and, for example, will not stand in the way of legitimate geological and geophysical research.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nor does the legislation apply to foreign nationals or corporations of countries which have enacted similar legislation. The reason for this is simple: the Government is seeking to encourage other countries to put in place similar legislation binding on their nationals. It is pleasing to see that a number of other countries have already moved in this direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The penalties for contravention of the legislation are, in the case of an individual, a maximum of one hundred thousand dollars; and for a body corporate, five hundred thousand dollars. Offences are indictable, although provision has been made for proceedings to be heard summarily if it is proper to do so and both the defendant and prosecutor agree. In that case the maximum penalties are correspondingly reduced.
       </para>

        In conclusion, the Government's stand on protection of the Antarctic environment has been strongly supported by the Australian community, and I believe this legislation will be widely welcomed. I urge the Opposition to be equally firm in their support of it.

       <para>
        I have pleasure in tabling the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Active Citizenship Revisited. The report reviews the extent to which the recommendations of our 1989 report, Education for Active Citizenship, have been implemented, as well as raising several other issues which I will touch on shortly.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the evidence of nearly 150 submissions received during the inquiry, it is clear that much more attention is now paid to citizenship education than was the case at the time of our previous inquiry. Some of the more formal indicators of this are the various policy and curriculum statements that have been developed by the State education departments and other school systems which identify citizenship as a particular goal. At the national level, Goal 7 of the Hobart Declaration of National Goals for Schools in Australia addresses itself to citizenship education and gives school systems the encouragement and the imprimatur to do likewise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although these are important developments-as I said, the Committee was impressed with a lot of the initiatives that have been taken-it is fair to say that there is still a significant gap between curriculum theory and classroom practice in this area. Good practices in the schools are dependent upon support for teachers through innovative learning materials, carefully devised teaching strategies and good in-servicing arrangements. In all these areas, there is still a lot of work to be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the matter of curriculum materials, the Committee is pleased to report that the work of our Parliamentary Education Office (PEO) in the national Parliament is very highly regarded by students and teachers. We recommend, in fact, that the PEO be given even greater support by the Parliament in future to enable it to extend its important role.
       </para>
       <para>
        Citizenship education is more than knowing how parliamentary democracy operates, and that is where a lot of the cracks start to appear. By and large, teacher education institutions are still not developing in teachers the participatory skills, the knowledge and the confidence that will enable them to go into schools and develop those same skills and attitudes in students. In the report we have tried to bring good ideas and practices to the attention of teachers so that they can translate those ideas into their own work. These are ideas about orienting young people towards their communities and getting them involved in real life public activity. They are ideas which belong across the curriculum and not just in some special subject called `active citizenship'.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have raised the issue of learning about values and argued that this has a legitimate place in the school curriculum. It is an area that some teachers and parents have traditionally felt rather uncomfortable about. But the ability to reflect on and critically examine our values is fundamental to the way we make choices and the way in which we create our futures. Let me say again: a lot of valuable guidance about these matters in many of the school education curricula has been developed by the States. It is now a matter of applying the necessary resources and training to convert those curriculum documents into living practices in schools.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, schools are not the only agencies of active citizenship education. We have highlighted quite a few initiatives which we think are worthy of replication by local governments, community organisations and professional associations. The various State parliaments are paying more attention to their educative role, though I must say that some States seem to be putting more into it than others. We have made various recommendations about the way legislatures might proceed in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear from the evidence that there is still a fairly strong sense of alienation in young people from the formal, institutionalised aspects of citizenship. Their knowledge of politics and parliament remains poor and there is a fair degree of cynicism about the democratic process as they see it paraded before them. It is worth noting that most of their information comes to them via the media, especially television, so if they are not getting the opportunity to participate in public and political activity in their own schools or communities, they are certainly constructing their own meanings and images of politics from what they see and hear in the media. Some of the meanings they construct, particularly about parliamentary politics and the processes of government, should be of particular concern to us as politicians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has also commented on the role of the media in political eduction, and has expressed its concern about the focus on conflict and a limited range of key political figures at the expense of issues-based political debate, and often without giving a context and grounding for the conflict being reported. We could find very little by way of hard research evidence on how young people learn from the media and the extent to which their political understandings are affected by it. We hope that will change in the future. There is also a strong case for some kind of ongoing survey-based research on the political knowledge and attitudes of young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, there are many excellent initiatives being taken in citizenship education and many of these have their roots in the recommendations of our 1989 report Education for Active Citizenship. There are a lot more policy pegs in place on which to hang citizenship education than there were back in 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        By the same token, there are still some major obstacles to overcome before we can be confident that our young people are being equipped with the skills and the attitudes to enable them to be effective, critical and creative participants in their communities. We have made 23 recommendations which have arisen out of the issues examined in this inquiry. Many of these recommendations are quite specifically targeted. We hope that the agencies to which they are directed will give them the consideration which we believe they deserve. I commend the report Active Citizenship Revisited to the Senate.

         —Yesterday when I commenced my remarks concerning this Bill I said that the Loan Bill over the years has been a normal mechanism for allowing the proper functioning of government and it has usually gone through without much comment. I said that on this occasion I was using my speech to condemn the Government for its failure to properly manage the economy which is highlighted by the introduction of this Bill and, indeed, is reinforced by the amending motion moved by Senator Short.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has touted itself as being such a competent manager in producing a continuing number of surpluses, it has not required the mechanism of this Bill since 1987. Thus, we have seen the surplus of $8.1 billion disappear down to $1.7 billion; in all likelihood to become a nil surplus or, indeed, to go into deficit. This Bill allows the opportunity for members of this place to put on record once again the fact that this Government has badly managed the economy and, of course, planned the recession in which all Australians are suffering.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also dealt yesterday with the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the way that its operation had changed as a result of the report of the Public Accounts Committee report which was brought down in 1988 and the Department of Finance agreeing to the recommendations that it made which, in fact, created a new category under which advances can be applied for and made. This is the category of a department or agency having erroneously omitted or understated the amount required in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1).
       </para>
       <para>
        As one goes through looking at the various backup documents supporting an application under the Advance, I have yet to see-and somebody may correct me if I am wrong-an application come because the department or agency has erroneously omitted or understated the original bid. Yet, if one looks at the nature of many of those applications, one could find that the proper category would be that one, as distinct from the category of urgent and unforeseen-both criteria needing to be satisfied.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday, I drew attention to a further application in February for some $28m worth of advance for Export Finance Insurance Corporation (EFIC). I think I said yesterday that that amount had not been dealt with in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), but in fact it has. But the more important fact that arises concerning EFIC is that the industry statement-the so-called blueprint for some sort of recovery which at best has had a lukewarm response and has seemed, as I heard one commentator say this morning, to not only fail to win new friends but in fact alienate old friends-has indeed set aside what one could perhaps describe as a slush fund of some $200m for EFIC.
       </para>
       <para>
        The baseline is that, very simply, it means that, on a continuing basis, the Government will not have to publish yet another application to the Advance to the Minister for Finance and have it subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament. It has had this fund put aside, which will mean that it is pushed out of scrutiny and away from public accountability. This $200m will no longer be subject to our scrutiny when they have to come cap in hand asking, on a regular basis, for additional funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The general signals that have been sent out by the introduction of this Bill are that we are finally seeing the death knell of this weary, and what some, indeed many, may consider this wearisome, Labor Government. It confirms the incompetent management and, indeed, looking at the broader picture, becomes a highlight focusing on the bad planning for the Budget that we saw come down in the third week of August where the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was still continuing to claim that the Government was in charge, on track and running the country in a competent way.
       </para>
       <para>
        We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer continue to make claims that the economy was being well run, until they finally had to come and say they had got it wrong, that we were in recession and, indeed, that the so-called soft landing that we were supposed to have became a very hard landing indeed, which has been illustrated and felt by ordinary Australians who are suffering bankruptcies; no longer able to keep paying their children's school fees; no longer able in some cases to buy shoes; no longer able to pay for school excursions; and, of course, are no longer able to meet mortgage payments. Ordinary Australia is hurting very badly.
       </para>
       <para>
        All of this, of course, has resulted in well publicised internal spats within the Australian Labor Party (ALP). We have had many examples in this chamber of Keating versus Button, Hawke versus Keating, Button versus Crean, Kelly and Richardson versus Griffiths, and Walsh versus the rest of the world. Outside the Labor Party, outside this chamber, we have seen the Labor Party's new found friends or the people who claim to have put this Labor Party back into government, the greens, now totally disenchanted.
       </para>
       <para>
        This morning there is news of a major union, which pays an affiliation fee to the Labor Party of $90,000 a year, disaffiliating and reportedly getting calls from its union members saying, `Well done! Well done!'. That union no longer wishes to be associated with this failed Government. The flirtation with business and industry has turned sour. No longer is the Treasurer anxiously sought to be consulted or heard from. No longer is there any respect for the Ministers who said that they were competent. That too has come to an end.
       </para>
       <para>
        By trying to be everybody's mate, the Prime Minister and his team are nobody's mate. They have dragged themselves down the dangerous path of trying to appease everyone and gone into a path of cowardice and contrition, and that is even apparent with regard to our role in the Kuwait conflict. Our role at best was seen as useful because we sent our ships in early, but the international judgment is that the Labor Party was fettered by its own left wing into not making a more substantial contribution. This has meant that, in terms of being involved in the reconstruction period of Kuwait and in being considered as an important partner, we lost ground. So again, by trying to appease the left wing, by trying to be everybody's mate, the Labor Party has failed to serve Australia's interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        I prefaced my remarks by saying that this Bill was an opportunity to again highlight the failures of the Government. John Cain in Victoria was once a much-vaunted Premier. John Cain is now totally discredited, just as this Government is discredited, simply because they are bad managers and have left the economy in tatters. John Cain used a prime pumping approach for his troubled economy. Hawke, Keating, Button and Willis have continually opened the public purse for those that the Government has been keen to appease. We saw $36m go to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd; we saw $59.34m go to Dupont; and we saw $31m go to the tourist industry. Yet they have not succeeded in buying the support that they so desperately required, and we have not seen Australia's interests served.
       </para>
       <para>
        For industry, the Government embarked on a program of tariff reduction; for that, we applaud it. Yet it has been at the expense of strong and sustained growth by attempting to appease its union friends, who, as I said, are now starting to show finally that they, too, are disgruntled; and one of these unions has taken the decision to disengage and disaffiliate from the ALP.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has failed to deliver on the highly important question of micro-economic reform and deregulation of the labour market. Until we see those two things done, tariff cuts alone will not solve our problems. The Labor Party can never deliver in those areas because it is its own constituency and will not cannibalise it. So all the self-pleading that says that the Labor Party has a special relationship with the union movement and, therefore, is the better manager has now been proved, after eight long and hard years, to be totally and utterly wrong. It is the servant of the movement, not the guider and master of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The essential point now is that the Government lacks the unity, conviction and, of course, the ability to rescue the Australian economy from the recession which is the one the Treasurer told us that we had to have-the one that the Government planned, engineered and delivered to the Australian people. The election day cannot come too soon to see a change of government to give this economy and the Australian people a chance to get back on the road to recovery and to see in place sound economic policies which will allow Australia to finally and properly compete internationally and have a chance to re-establish and maintain living standards.

         —This Loan Bill, of course, should not exist. Any government that had any competence at all would not be required to change the whole basis of its economic approach, as this one has, by being required to bring in a Loan Bill when it had boasted that the main thrust of its economic policy was to avoid having to borrow money and to maintain restraint and that it knew what it was doing. We on this side of the House have been telling the Government for quite some time that it does not know what it is doing. It gives us no comfort to be proved right in this way.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think that what one has to recognise now is that not only is this Loan Bill needed, but an economic statement was needed. It was not the economic statement we got, because this economic statement is obviously too little too late. But at least we have had a recognition by the Government that it has made a mess of things and that it has had to introduce this economic statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the statement does not grasp at the heart of the real problems. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement will not make Australia strong again. In fact, it fails to come to grips with the reality of our economic circumstances or to have any appreciation of the magnitude of the task that has to be done in terms of boosting our national production, boosting our exports, boosting our import capabilities so that we can both eliminate inflation and bring our debt under control ultimately to reduce it.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is import replacement capability. The other point that Dr Hewson made is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hawke has only gone as far as the union leadership will let him go. All the key areas that relate to waterfront reform, transportation reform, telecommunications reform, public sector reform, labour market reform and so on are all areas which have been effectively vetoed by the union movement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, this economic statement depends more on wishful thinking than reality. One could say that it is a bit like the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself-all wishbone and no backbone. I like Senator Walsh's comment about Mr Hawke. I think he referred to him as `Old Jellyback'. I would like to see less jelly in this economic statement and more backbone-less wishbone, more backbone. That is what is needed in this Government, but I am afraid that it has now reached the degenerative point where the bones are too brittle to carry any flesh whatsoever.

         —And there is not much marrow. I thank the honourable senator for his interjection. I want to deal, however, with the major disaster that is hitting young Australians as a result of this Government's economic mismanagement. In my role as shadow Minister for youth affairs, I unfortunately come across these problems. The reality of this disaster seems to have escaped this Government. The youth jobless figures are appalling. There will be more coming out today, I think at 11.30 a.m., when the labour force figures come out. As it is, according to the January statistics, an average of 25.8 per cent of young Australians throughout the nation are unable to find jobs.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When we look at the individual States, we find that this is a fairly uneven problem. The situation is far worse in some States than in others, and it is no coincidence that the worst States are the Labor States and the best State in terms of the lowest level of youth unemployment is the Liberal State of New South Wales. That State traditionally, no matter who is in government, has a relatively high unemployment rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        We note from these statistics the huge gap between youth unemployment and adult unemployment. I am dealing only with the published statistics, and I will demonstrate later in my speech that the published statistics massively understate the real level of youth unemployment of young Australians in this nation. Frankly, these official statistics have been subject to statistical gimmickry and have been diminished by multimillion dollar taxpayer funded Government schemes-some of which I hope are working-to enhance the opportunities of young people and to increase their skill levels. But a lot of them, regrettably, appear to be little more than some kind of unemployed teenager sitting ventures aimed at hiding the real level of youth unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        While dealing with the official statistics, let us recognise the dreadful gap that exists between youth and adult unemployment. Let us also recognise the hierarchy of disaster in young people's unemployment which starts off-I notice a colleague from Tasmania, Senator Calvert, here-with Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment rate for people looking for full time work aged between 15 and 19, those in the under-20s bracket, at 31.7 per cent. Almost one in three young Tasmanians cannot find a job.

        <para in-line="1">
         —In the city of Hobart itself, as Senator Calvert interjects, it is 39 per cent. This sort of appalling situation is, I fear, what is to become commonplace; it is becoming commonplace around Australia. In the Illawarra region of New South Wales, where I have my office, it is about one in three-about 33 per cent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Then we find that Queensland-another good Labor Government-has the next highest rate of 27.8 per cent of young Australians out of work. We have South Australia, 27.1 per cent; Western Australia, 25.5 per cent; and Victoria, 25.1 per cent. While Victoria is only the second best, after New South Wales, can I say that in Victoria that unemployment rate has just about doubled over the last 12 months, as Victoria Inc.-the Labor Government's disaster-has decimated the economic strength and jobs in that State. It has gone up from 12.7 per cent for youth unemployment in January 1990 to 25.1 per cent in January 1991. In New South Wales, where things are naturally getting worse in line with the rest of Australia, the youth unemployment rate in January was 23.4 per cent, just a slight rise from the 20.6 per cent of the previous January, but nothing like the sort of blowout, the sort of disaster, that has hit Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then if one looks at the sort of relationship between that and adult unemployment, one sees that in Victoria, for example, the adult unemployment rate is 8.1 per cent and the youth unemployment rate is 25.1 per cent-three times as bad as for adults. Yet this Government still refuses to look at the concept of a training wage so that young people would have greater prospects of getting jobs and being trained without imposing the sort of burden on employers, who are facing severe economic difficulties, as, say, an adult worker. At the moment the wage differentials are so small that it is simply uneconomic for employers, as these figures indicate, to take on unskilled, untrained young people so that they can get a start in life when in fact their wage rates are just so close to adult wage rates and yet their productivity difference is enormous.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the figure as we see it now. Let us look to what the reality is. I should just mention in passing, while still dealing with the figures, that the adult figures are horrendous and getting worse. I was not trying to suggest that the adult figures with which I was comparing the youth figures were wonderful. Even though the youth figures are three times as bad, the adult figures are terrible. As the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) pointed out only the other day, there are now 24 people competing for every available job. This is a long way from the 7 : 1 ratio that was recorded less than two years ago. This is because there are something like three-quarters of a million jobless and an estimated 31,000 job vacancies. That situation is, of course, disastrous.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at how even more serious the youth unemployment figures are when you examine them closely. As I mentioned, this combination of statistical gimmickry and multi-million dollar taxpayer funded schemes and the disappearance of tens of thousands of 15- to 19-year-olds from the official statistics really means that the actual level of youth unemployment could be as much as 50 per cent worse than the current horrific under-20-year-old jobless rate of more than one in four. The January 1990-91 labour force statistics reveal the loss of 84,000 full time jobs for 15- to 19-year-olds over the past 12 months. This, of course, leaves the full time unemployment rate at 25.8 per cent, which is the worst January level for six years anyway.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a set of statistics based on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the unemployment rate in Australia for persons aged between 15 and 19, the number of unemployed persons and the number of employed persons in that category, along with a table showing the 15- to 19-year-old job scene.

         —These statistics reveal that on top of these full time jobs that have just disappeared, have been lost, over the last 12 months as the number of young people employed full time has collapsed from 471,000 to 387,000, a further 23,600 part time jobs were wiped out, giving a total job loss for the year of 107,200. Those jobs for young people existed in January 1990 but do not exist today. But even though 107,000 jobs were lost, the figure for the people unemployed rose only by 42,800. This is less than half the number of jobs lost. What happened to the remaining 64,400 young Australians whose jobs were wiped out? Most of them-almost 40,000-just disappeared out of the work force, with the remaining 25,400 accounted for by a reduction in the 15- to 19-year-old population. A proportion of that extraordinary number of 64,000 who disappeared can be explained by a change in the population, but the great bulk is unexplained.

       <para>
        Although these `disappearers' have not been able to get jobs, they have not been included in the unemployment figures as a combination of a statistical gimmick and Hawke Government multi-million dollar schemes combined to push the potentially unemployed out of sight. As a result of this, the participation rate-that is, the percentage of youth population in the work force, either in or looking for a job-has dramatically fallen in the latest year. I have never seen such a fall in the participation rate. It has fallen from 66.1 per cent to a lowest ever January figure of 62.7 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        These latest disappearing jobless figures continue a trend that was reinforced in 1986 when the Hawke Government not only began paying Austudy to secondary students to encourage them to stay at school rather than joining dole queues but also changed the definition of being unemployed-listen to this definition-so that an unpaid family helper working only one hour a week is no longer classified as being unemployed. All a person has to do is work for one hour a week in a corner store or on a farm and get no pay and, according to these statistics, the person is not included in the unemployment list. This is just a farce.
       </para>
       <para>
        It certainly had an impact. In the five years since then the result has been that an increase in the 15- to 19-year-old population of 53,400 has added only 4,000 young people to the work force; the remaining 49,400 have just disappeared from the employment-or more likely the unemployment-figures. Paying Austudy to more than 150,000 secondary students aged 15 to 19 now costs more than $300m a year and is clearly aimed at removing some of the unemployment problem into the classroom. For some it will bring greater educational opportunities and broaden their options. To that extent, there is clearly a benefit. For others it is little more than an expensive teen-sitting exercise that fiddles the jobless figures as young Australians who would rather be working for a wage get paid simply to fill in time at school.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a huge number of under-employed young people, whose only opportunity to work is part time as the number of full time jobs available for 15- to 19-year-olds has collapsed. It is now far harder for young Australians to get a full time job than it was in recession-hit 1983, as the number of under-20s in full time work has slumped by 77,000 since 1983 to only 387,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        We keep on hearing about the Fraser Government's recession; how terrible it was; how it was as a result of the Fraser Government's incompetence. We never hear anything about the worst drought in 50 years. But right now there are 77,000 fewer young people employed in this country than in the 1983 recession despite the big increase in the population of 15- to 19-year-olds. We do not hear that sort of statistic from this Government. In fact, this statistic is despite a rise of almost 100,000 in the 15- to 19-year-old population, three quarters of whom have not even bothered to join the work force which rose during this period from 1983 by only 24,300. There are now 861,300 young Australians wanting to work but only 387,000 full time jobs for them. As a result, eight years of hard Labor has meant that the number making do with part time jobs has soared from 156,400, or 25 per cent of the job market, to 277,400 or 42 per cent. They cannot get full time jobs so they have to make do-those that have been lucky enough-with part time jobs. Yet the official statistics, which show the full time 15- to 19-year-old unemployment rate of 25.8 per cent, which is still a little below the January 1983 level of 29 per cent, do not tell the real story of the hidden army of unemployed young Australians that lifts the real unemployment level of 1991 far above the drought-affected recession of 1983. Yet it was Mr Hawke, who, when dealing with Australia's problems, then said that there was:

       <para>
        . . . none worse than the disastrous unemployment situation, particularly that facing young Australians . . . Levels of unemployment anything like those of the past couple of years cannot and should not be tolerated . . . No Australian Government should ever be forgiven for creating . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet the Hawke Government has created them, and not because of the century's worst drought, as in 1983, or a world recession or an oil shock, but almost entirely through its own mismanagement of the boom and bust economy it fostered. The Hawke Government, in Mr Hawke's own words, `should never be forgiven' for the blight of worsening unemployment, both evident and hidden, that it is imposing on young Australians. What will it do about it?

        But what is the Government doing about youth unemployment? It is doing a little lateral thinking. During the next three years it will spend $15m to boost lagging school retention rates in rural areas. To the extent that encouraging young people to go to school increases their job options, their job opportunities and their skill levels in the long run, it is marvellous. But it is interesting-the Government thinks that moving young people out of the labour market is the only way to resolve this problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        After all, the Government has managed to fiddle the figures for the last five years by doing it, so why not try it now? It is $15m to encourage young people in rural areas to stay at school. I think it was Mr Dawkins who noted in his statement that although educational authorities have achieved success in recent years in raising retention rates, particularly in the crucial Year 12 level, country schools are still experiencing problems retaining students. The national discrepancy between urban and rural retention rates is about 5 per cent. In some country areas of New South Wales the gap is even wider.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will tell the Senate what the Austudy situation now is. As I said, Austudy was introduced in 1986. Austudy is available, subject to certain academic criteria, to fulltime secondary students aged 16 years and over undertaking an approved secondary course. Assistance is targeted to low income groups through income and assets tests applying to the students and, for dependent students, to parents as well. In other words, quite properly this assistance is aimed at lower income groups, the very area from which the highest level of unemployment among young people is likely to emerge. We can see that from the regional unemployment statistics. Clearly, the target of such a program is those young people who would be more likely to be joining the unemployment pool. As I said, while I welcome the fact that some of them may receive clear benefit as a result of this change, others may not.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Budget Papers, altogether it is estimated that, in 1991, 36 per cent of secondary students aged 16 years and over will be assisted by Austudy. It is interesting to look at that figure because the retention rate has just about doubled. It used to be that about 35 per cent of students would stay at school for Year 12. I believe it is now 60-odd per cent. It is interesting to query whether Austudy for secondary school students has in fact been such a factor in their retention.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the clear impression from the Government's response in the statement on lagging retention rates in rural areas is that it sees Austudy as a way of doctoring the unemployment figures. There has been a trend, evident for something like 10 years, toward a reduction in youth employment and, as a result, a change in the figures. I am not suggesting that this trend has suddenly emerged, because it has been there for 10 years. What I am saying is that the huge acceleration in job loss among young people in the last 12 months is a condemnation of this Government's policies, is clear evidence of its incompetence, of its lack of direction and of its having created an atmosphere of hopelessness among young people about what lies before them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest to people that, when they are looking at the unemployment figures and saying to themselves, `Well, the unemployment rate does not look as bad as it did back in 1983', the reality is far worse. The outlook for young people is dreadful. What young people desperately need is a government with a sense of vision, with a sense of purpose and with the policies to turn the economy around to give them a fair go, a real opportunity to develop their skills and to be useful contributors in the workplace. This Government has provided them with nothing apart from gimmicks and schemes. It has provided them with little hope.
       </para>
       <para>
        I certainly hope that the widespread concern about the Government's capacity, expressed following the March statement, will ultimately be translated into a massive rejection of the Government at the polls so that a government under John Hewson, which knows what it is doing, which has a sense of direction and purpose and which has the capacity to take hard and proper decisions, will replace this present dreadful, directionless government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said at the beginning of my speech, the March statement is like Mr Hawke-all wishbone, no backbone. I hope that we will get a change of direction, a change for the better; a genuine change in economic approach which will in fact restore hope and restore the prospect of employment to the hundreds of thousands of young Australians who, under this Government, face a bleak future.

         —In summing up, I should say that there would be little point in replying to the somewhat colourful rhetoric used by Senator Michael Baume. The Loan Bill 1991 is a fairly routine machinery Bill. I would not have thought it necessary to turn it into a general debate on us versus them, or them versus us, however one likes to put it. This Bill is simply to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to cover any shortfall from consolidated revenue. I do not think there is any big deal about that. It is quite normal. It has been done by governments for years. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         —The Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill has the support of the Opposition, which is not surprising because, in fact, the Government has simply followed the Opposition's policy concerning the Antarctic. We led the way in this matter. The main features of Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill 1991, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 6 March 1991, are to prohibit mining and related activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory and to prohibit such activities by Australian nationals and corporations anywhere in Antarctica.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The principal features are that mining activity by Australians anywhere in Antarctica will be prohibited. Mining activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory will be prohibited. Mining activity will be given a wide definition to include any activity, such as prospecting and exploration, which could lead to the recovery of minerals. An exemption is made for scientific research and investigation and any activities supporting or associated with such activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Antarctic Territory has been defined to include the adjacent continental shelf. In this area mining by any persons or companies is to be prohibited with two exceptions: persons who are excluded by the Antarctic Treaty-designated observers or scientific personnel exchanged under the provisions of the treaty-will not come within the scope of this legislation unless their acts cannot be regarded as legitimate for the purposes of the treaty; and persons who are exempted from the operation of the legislation if they are nationals of a country which has enacted similar legislation. The maximum penalty provided is $100,000 but, if dealt with summarily, the penalty reduces to $10,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a corporation. That, I might say, was a problem which did concern us in the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        When dealing with this matter only yesterday, Mr Chaney said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . we are dealing with the issue of mining, and if it did take place-there has even been talk of the possibility of subsidised mining activities in the Antarctic by people anxious to establish some position-the sort of penalty that is laid down might be regarded as a mere flea bite. When compared with penalties in the Trades Practices Act for other offences it is comparatively light. I would like the Government's considered view on the adequacy of penalties so that we can consider that view and perhaps look to moving amendments in the other House.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, we will not be moving amendments here. Just before I rose to speak Mr Chaney received a letter from Mrs Kelly, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, in these terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am responding to your request for further information on the penalties provided for in the Antarctic Mining Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill provided for a maximum penalty of $100,000 for offences against these provisions. Due to the operations of the Crimes Act 1914 this is an amount of $500,000 if the offender is a corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The penalties were established following consideration of similar offences in other legislation and the amount has been set at this level on the basis that the Great Barrier Marine Park Act 1975 provides for a penalty of $50,000 if the offender is an individual ($250,000 for a corporation). The trend in environmental legislation is to impose higher penalties and the penalty in the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill reflects this.
       </para>
       <para>
        You should also appreciate that the offence is indictable and the Proceeds of Crime Act (1987) operates so that the court can order profits to be forfeited and/or additional pecuniary penalty orders.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 8 provides for minor offences to be dealt with in a court of summary jurisdiction if it is proper to do so and both the defendant and the prosecutor consent to this. A lower penalty reflects the fact that this will occur in circumstances where the offence is of a minor nature. However, it is still indictable so that the Proceeds of Crime Act is applicable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have confirmed this advice with the Attorney-General's Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that basis, the Opposition will not proceed with its foreshadowed amendments in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to mention a bit of the background to this legislation. The coalition has taken a very high profile against any form of mining in Antarctica. We were ahead of the Government when it was divided over whether or not to sign the proposed Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. Mr Keating was reported to be opposed to signing, but Senators Richardson and Evans leaned the other way. On 2 May 1989, almost two years ago, the coalition formally decided to oppose Australia's signing the convention and called on the Government to take immediate action to seek an international regime providing for a total prohibition on mining in the Antarctic. The next day, former Senator Chris Puplick successfully moved in the Senate a motion which included the following points:
       </para>
       <para>
        the Antarctic continent should be protected as fully as possible from threats to its unique environment
       </para>
       <para>
        it is incompatible with the above to allow any mining activity to take place in the Antarctic
       </para>
       <para>
        Three weeks later, under increasing political pressure, the Government at last said it would not sign. The Opposition's current environment policy expresses strong support for the Antarctic Treaty as providing the most effective method for the control and protection of the Antarctic environment, and opposes any attempt to alter substantially the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty. The policy also reaffirms our opposition to signing the minerals regime. We have opposed the world park concept floated in some quarters, preferring instead what we have called an Antarctic Treaty park operating within the framework of the treaty and involving no abrogation of claims of sovereignty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has obtained the support of France in its opposition to mining. The most recent international development was a meeting in Chile in December last year of the Antarctic Treaty parties. Mrs Kelly and Senator Evans hailed the outcome of that meeting as a major step towards an international ban on mining in Antarctica. The meeting agreed to a draft negotiating text for the development of a legal instrument to protect the environment. That text provides that any activity relating to mineral resources, other than for scientific research, would be prohibited. The Ministers concede that a long and difficult period of negotiation lies ahead.
       </para>

        There is no doubt that the aim of this Bill is clearly to strengthen Australia's moral position in terms of its campaign to achieve a mining ban-a position, I might say, that the Government came to belatedly after what has clearly been a large amount of division within its ranks. It is essentially an exercise in setting an example demonstrating Australia's willingness to take as much action as lies within its power to do what it wants the rest of the world to accept.
       </para>
       <para>
        There would be considerable difficulties in enforcing the proposed ban on mining activities by other nations in Australia's claimed territory, which covers about 40 per cent of the Antarctic continent, and we should recognise that. While there is cooperation between the treaty countries and territorial claims, other nations do not recognise those claims, and effective action against transgressions by foreign nationals would inevitably be a long and difficult process. Against this, the mounting of any exploration or mining activity in the Antarctic is a very difficult undertaking, and any such activity is said to be easily detectable. The Government announced in August last year that it would legislate to ban mining. Senator Chaney, as he was at the time, issued a statement, after consultation with Senator Hill, welcoming any effective action that would further protect the Antarctic environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, the Opposition supports this Bill. I mention in passing that Mr Chaney in the other place commended a speech given by the Australian Ambassador for the Environment, Sir Ninian Stephen, on 24 October last year which is reported in the monthly Record. It sets out at some length the possible environmental consequences of mining activity. Unfortunately, the Ambassador's speech omits in his chronology of events the Opposition's stance on this matter, which we in the Opposition are quite sure was very important in terms of the Government's own decision making. The Government, in my view, would not have come to this decision without the strong public view expressed by the Opposition of total opposition to mining in the Antarctic.

         —It will probably come as no surprise to anyone that the Australian Democrats fully support the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill 1991. We are very encouraged by the Opposition's support for the Bill also, although we share some of its concerns about the size of fines. Having listened to Senator Baume, I think we agree that there are good reasons at the moment at least for the size of those fines.

        Australian legislation to prohibit all mining in Antarctica is, of course, only the very first part of what we hope will be an eventual decision by international agreement for the establishment of a world park over the entire continent. The Democrats welcome the Australian Government's decision in May 1989 to reject the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities and work instead for an Antarctic wilderness park. We acknowledge that we were surprised, but very pleased, that the Opposition also took that stand and, in fact, took it a little before the Government did. We have been taking that stand for a long time.
       </para>
       <para>
        That resolution and this Bill represent important decisions in Australian Government policy towards Antarctica-decisions which we have long advocated, which we now support and which we feel demonstrate to the world that Australia is serious about protecting the Antarctic environment. The uniqueness of Antarctica lies in the fact that the Antarctic region of the world encompasses a huge wilderness which remains substantially unaffected by human activity. It is, in fact, the only continent on which human impact has been minimal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Millions of people around the world already believe that Antarctica and its surrounding seas should remain the world's greatest wilderness area, protected from mining and preserved for the benefit of future generations. Antarctica and its surrounding seas hold a unique place in the history of the world. Rich in animal and marine plant life, the region provides an opportunity for scientists and the world to better understand the extraordinary ecosystem that makes up the continent. Until recently, of course, it appeared likely that Antarctica would be treated with the same indifference as the rest of the world and be made available for mining.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats are very pleased that the Australian Government's opposition to mining appears to have stopped the Antarctic Minerals Convention so far in its tracks. Without the support of countries such as Australia, France and New Zealand, the existing Minerals Convention cannot hope to become international law. Nevertheless, as the recent meeting of Antarctic Treaty nations in Chile last December showed, it will not be easy to achieve the international agreement needed to completely rule out mining in Antarctica. I understand that there are still deep divisions among the Antarctic Treaty nations over a permanent ban on mining.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the support Australia and France have gathered for their proposals, a small number of countries, including Britain and the United States, remain opposed to a mining ban. We suspect that, ultimately, the outcome of these negotiations will depend a good deal on the strength of international public support for the idea of preserving the Antarctic environment and for the world park concept. A loss on this issue, where the case for environmental protection is so powerful, would be seen as a major setback for the environment generally and, of course, for Antarctica in particular. Regardless of that outcome, we believe that the moratorium on mining activity in Antarctica which has existed since 1977 must be allowed to continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, treaty members are exercising voluntary restraint on mining activity on the continent until the current consultations on the mining convention are completed. Pro-mining members, including the United States, Britain and Japan, have unfortunately in the past used the threat of ending their voluntary restraint in order to force discussions on mining to their advantage. Obviously such a tactic is unacceptable and should occasion strong international condemnation. Here, the support of other claimant states, such as France and New Zealand, is crucial because, like Australia, they too have the capacity to prevent mining in the areas they claim in much the same way as this Bill seeks to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, as I said earlier, the Democrats hope that, ultimately, the world will not just place a permanent and longstanding ban on mining in Antarctica, but will eventually embrace the concept of a wilderness park for the entire continent. A permanent international ban on mining is an important step forward, but an Antarctic wilderness park would take the matter further by recognising the importance of the area for conservation and for important scientific research.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only this week, six Australian scientists completed a 5,000-kilometre crossing of previously unexplored regions of Antarctica. The team, led by Australian glaciologist, Dr Robert Kiernan, managed to collect information on ice sheet movement, snow accumulation and atmospheric conditions around Lambert Glacier, which is the world's largest glacier. This sort of information is important in assessing changes to the region's climate over hundreds of years and for better understanding the present changes in the earth's climate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, in view of the information which such scientific research can provide, and given the fact that recent international attention has been focused on the greenhouse effect and the problem of global warming, one can easily understand why Antarctica should be protected from all mining activity. Naturally, the establishment of an international wilderness park for Antarctica would offer increased protection and give the continent a status equivalent to that of national parks in many countries, including Australia. Such a declaration would be a legal instrument to establish the absolute priority of nature conservation of Antarctica while continuing to allow compatible uses, such as science and some very controlled tourism.
       </para>
       <para>
        Antarctica's unique qualities are its wildlife, its ice scenery and its wilderness. By emphasising the maintenance of the wilderness condition, all of these qualities can be protected. The fact is that there will never be another Antarctica. If we choose to save it, then it will become a living reminder of human ability to preserve our past, present and future, and to live in harmony with our environment. A ban on mining provided by this Bill is a very welcome and important part of a total strategy to protect the Antarctic environment forever.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats hope this legislative move will gather widespread international support, particularly from the other Antarctic Treaty nations. It is recognition of the fact that Antarctica is an area of heritage which must be protected and saved for ongoing generations for all time. On this basis, we give it our full support.

         —As the two previous speakers have stated, the principal feature of the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill 1991 is to prohibit mining and related activities in the Australian Antarctic territory and to prohibit such activities by Australian nationals and corporations anywhere in Antarctica. As a result, mining activity by Australians anywhere in Antarctica will be prohibited. In addition, the activity of mining per se in the Australian Antarctic territory will also be prohibited.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Under the Bill's guidelines, the definition of a mining activity will be given a broad recognition so as to include any activity, such as prospecting and exploration, which could lead to the recovery of minerals. However, an exception is made for scientific research and investigation and any activity which may be supporting or associated with such research.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Antarctic continent has been described as the world's last great wilderness. This has been referred to by Senator Bourne. It is certainly the highest, oldest, windiest continent on earth and its relative isolation has afforded it a unique opportunity to survive in an almost pristine environment. I think that Mr Gary Nehl and Mr Jim Snow-one of Senator Richardson's colleagues-in the other place could attest to the wilderness and wildness of the place. They have just returned from their voyage on the Icebird, which I believe was probably one of the worst they have ever experienced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may be interested to know that ice covers 98 per cent of the continent and that most of that coverage is between 4,000 feet and 6,000 feet thick. It is also amazing to realise that Antarctica doubles in size and then halves again each year. It represents one of the most breathtaking and yet the most hostile environments on our earth. Within that environment, it encompasses a diverse range of wildlife ranging from blue whales, seals, penguins, krill and birds to a wide array of plant life such as mosses, lichens and algae. The food chain of the Antarctic is particularly fragile and the cold temperature and salty soils mean that the birds and seals rely on the rich resources of the ocean for their food.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has always played a very important role in the Antarctic. We maintain three permanent bases at Casey, Davis and Mawson. A further permanent station is located on Macquarie Island and four temporary summer bases are located in the Larsemann Hills, the Bunger Hills, on Heard Island and at Commonwealth Bay. It is important to remember that Australia claims almost 42 per cent of the Antarctic continent. That claim was reasserted in the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty Act 1960. The total area of our claim is approximately 6.1 million square kilometres. Eventually, the vast size and isolated nature of Antarctica posed the question as to the possibility of it containing mineral resources. As a result, the early 1970s saw the first international discussions regarding the possible consequences of exploitation of Antarctic resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time, it should be acknowledged that our understanding of Antarctica's mineral and hydrocarbon potential is limited. The vast expanses of ice cover and the extremes of temperature make assessment difficult. What information there is appears to suggest that minerals of value do exist in the region, both on the continent and in surrounding waters. To date, traces of cobalt, promium, nickel, titanium, uranium, silver, gold, coal and iron have been located, but the quantities of such deposits have been very limited.
       </para>

        In 1985 a United States government report stated that the likely recoverable reserve of oil in promised offshore areas could be in the order of tens of billions of barrels. Previously, a Gulf oil executive had placed on the record his company's views that the two most promising areas in the Ross and Weddell seas were in the range of 50 million barrels, but could be much more.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the early 1970s, Soviet geologists predicted that the oil resources of Antarctica would exceed those of Alaska. Of concern, of course, is the fact that several nations have made no secret of their interest in Antarctica's mineral resources. The Soviets established Druzhnaya station in the Weddell Sea in 1975 as the first base in the region particularly set aside for mineral prospecting. The Japanese conducted a 3-year survey in 1988 and West Germany, Norway and the United States have undertaken seismic surveys with a view to ascertaining mineral potential. Whilst Antarctica's isolation acted as a barrier, technological advances and an increasing presence of scientists on the Antarctic continent have rekindled the debate regarding mining in the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should make it quite clear at this point that the coalition's position in regard to Antarctic mining has been unequivocal. This compares with the Government's position which has involved much posturing by various Ministers and caused considerable disquiet in the community. It is fair to say that the Government has repeatedly followed the Opposition's lead in relation to Antarctic mining and, in fact, the banning of it. The Opposition believes the area must be protected for the future and that any mining presents a threat to the fragile environment.

        One only needs to consider the tragic consequences of the Exxon Valdez accident to appreciate man's total inability to regulate his activities. As tragic as the consequences of the Exxon Valdez accident were, and as much as the company concerned has been prepared to allocate millions of dollars to clear up the problem-and that is not to mention the fines that we heard on the news this morning of billions of dollars-the catastrophe of the situation in the Antarctic, should such an incident occur, would be multiplied many, many times over. Not only would the consequences be much worse, but the chances of restoring the situation would be virtually impossible.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is some background to the Mining Prohibition Bill which I believe warrants considerable attention by the Senate. In June of 1988 the Convention of the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, known as CRAMRA, was adopted by the Antarctic Treaty consultative parties. The aim of CRAMRA was to provide a mechanism for assessing the impact on the Antarctic environment of mining activities to decide whether they were acceptable and, if so, to regulate those activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Between 25 November 1988 and 25 November 1989, the 16 countries involved in the consultative process were invited to sign the convention. By May 1989, only Australia and France had signed. For the convention to come into effect, it required the signatures of all member countries. This situation resulted in a period of public debate within our country and whilst the Government was trying to decide its position, the then shadow Minister for the Environment, Senator Puplick, made the Opposition's position very clear.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 2 May 1989, the coalition formally decided to oppose the signing of the convention and, at the same time, called upon the Government to take action for a total prohibition of mining in the Antarctic. On 3 May, Senator Puplick successfully moved in this place, with the support of the Australian Democrats and I believe Senator Vallentine, a motion which sought to ensure that the Antarctic continent remained fully protected from any possible threat to its unique environment. That motion reaffirmed the belief that it was incompatible to allow any mining activity in Antarctica.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fair to say, though, that while this was occurring, the Government vacillated. It became apparent that there were certain divisions between the then Environment Minister, Senator Richardson-who is at the table-and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, who was openly canvassing the view that Australia should sign the convention. At the same time, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, and the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, were offering a very different view even to the point of suggesting a world park for the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter became further complicated for the Government when on 14 April the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Jones, expressed support for the development of the CRAMRA regime. The Opposition held the view that there were significant deficiencies in the CRAMRA; that the guidelines were far too loose; and that the convention, as it had been drawn up, effectively encouraged and facilitated mining activity to take place in Antarctica.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is significant that some three weeks after the Senate had passed the Opposition's motion, the Government also announced that it would not be signing the agreement and that, as a result, the agreement would not come into place. I believe the point which best emerges from the events which occurred in May of 1989 is that despite what the Government may choose to say to the contrary, it is clearly being left behind by the Opposition in terms of recognising the worth of the Antarctic region.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 22 May 1989 that the Government would not sign the CRAMRA, and following what will undoubtedly be the successful passage of this legislation through the Parliament, Australia will be in a creditable position to take our views on the prohibition of mining in Antarctica to the rest of the world. With this commitment behind us, Australia can seek to ensure that other Antarctic nations provide a similar commitment for the areas which they have under their control. I know that this view is also shared by France.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am also aware that there have been some preliminary discussions between Antarctic Treaty parties on the negotiation of an instrument which would set up a regime for a comprehensive Antarctic environmental protection. As I understand it, there has already been a number of points of agreement as to what such an instrument should contain. It appears that there is general agreement that human activities in Antarctica should be planned and conducted with a view to limiting the impact on our environment, and that such activities should only be on the basis that there is sufficient information to enable informed judgments to be made about the impact on the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to congratulate the present management of the Antarctic Division for the wonderful work it has done over recent times in cleaning up the Antarctic. In fact, Senator Puplick and myself viewed a load of garbage and old rubbish that had been brought back from the Antarctic a couple of years ago down in Hobart on the Lady Franklin. I know it is a very important part of the Antarctic Division at the moment to clear up the wreckage that has been left behind from many parties that have gone there over the years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, there have been a couple of oil spills in the Antarctic, which I have mentioned before. I place on the record once more that I hope such oil spills do not occur again. The Antarctic Treaty consultative parties have now recommended that a special meeting be convened to further discuss the issue of mining. The joint efforts of Australia and France have already been successful in attracting the support of New Zealand, Belgium and Italy. It is also well-known that other nations such as India and Germany are sympathetic.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regrettably, however, I understand that to date there has been no agreement between the Antarctic Treaty partners as to whether the proposed international instrument should ban mining. I know that I safely speak on behalf of the Opposition when I say that the Government can rely on bipartisan support for whatever measures it may believe are necessary to obtain international support for Australia's position. The importance of this Bill passing through our Parliament must not be lost to the general international community and I believe that every avenue should be explored to promote Australia's views.
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred earlier to a number of misconceptions which have been deliberately supported by this Government in relation to the coalition's record on the environment. I have no doubt that the Government's desire to discredit the Opposition through its contacts in the media and its own propaganda organisation, the National Media Liaison Service, has been motivated purely by reasons of electoral expediency.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has sought to present itself as the unquestioned protector of the environment and the Opposition as a group with no such concerns. This most definitely has never been the case and never will be the case. If we need any better example of the Government's environmental hypocrisy, we need only to refer to the economic statement which occurred earlier this week. Those who were promised no resource security legislation have been left wallowing as the Government realises that commonsense must prevail at the end of the day.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a very valid argument for maintaining our environment for the future. Indeed, contrary to what the Government may suggest, many of those reasons are economic. No industry deliberately sets out to destroy its own livelihood, and I think it is fair to say that over recent years, with the excellent work which has been done by the member for Pearce, Fred Chaney, our shadow Minister for the environment and his predecessor from this chamber, Senator Chris Puplick, that both the public and the conservation groups are starting to realise that it is the Opposition which has now taken a clear lead on environmental matters.

        Earlier in this speech, I referred to the lead given by the Opposition on mining in the Antarctic, and the Government cannot deny that. But the coalition's record on the environment goes much deeper and, to me, one of the most important aspects of the success which previous coalition governments have achieved is that it has been achieved without drastic State-Federal conflicts. It is on the record that coalition governments have worked with State governments to achieve very meaningful objectives in the environmental arena.

        It was a coalition government which moved to prohibit sand mining on Fraser Island and it was a coalition government which proclaimed the Kakadu and Uluru parks.

In addition, it was a coalition government which secured the listing of the Willandra Lakes and it was a coalition government which originated the proposals for the listing of the Lord Howe Island group and the Western Tasmanian Wilderness Park in 1982. As a member of the coalition, I am proud of our environmental record and I am prepared to put that record up against the temporary political expediency of this Government at any time.

I would ask those present to compare this with the headline-grabbing of the present Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) who, rather than tackling the issues by legislation, seeks to make her contribution by purportedly downgrading her ministerial vehicle only to find that the savings which she announced will not occur.

        There is one particular aspect of the coalition's environment policy which I would like the Government consider, and that is our belief that there should be a massive national approach to the issue of soil degradation. The coalition went into the last election with a program which would have seen the amount of money allocated to soil degradation doubled. I acknowledge though that the Government has increased funding in this area but the fact remains that the increase pales into insignificance compared to that suggested by us at the last election.

        Only yesterday, I read in the Australian a very disturbing article on the problem of salinity, which is devastating the Murray-Darling Basin. Some senators may not be aware that the Lowbidgee is eastern Australia's most significant wetland. It is the inland sea which was sought by the early explorer, Oxley. Salinity is devastating this area. In fact, the small Victorian community of Kerang has already been destroyed. The area is becoming a testimony to man's desire to change the environment rather than to live with it. The consequences are disastrous. This is the most important breeding area of native water birds in eastern Australia, but large scale clearing and irrigation systems have changed the natural balance. These are the sorts of issues which this Government should be addressing.

        Another area of some concern is the tropical forests and their survival. This is another area where the Government could well learn from the coalition.

It is nice to have bipartisanship on this important issue because it is an issue which is beyond party politics. So I am not going to say too much on the comments that Senator Calvert made about the Opposition's record as opposed to the Government's record, but suffice to say that the Greens of Western Australia (WA) certainly support the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill, which of course follows on in a very logical way from the Government's rejection of the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activity (CRAMRA) agreement in May 1989. I would point out though that I well remember, as Senator Calvert documented, that it was the Opposition, encouraged by environment groups, that really gave the Government the nudge on that occasion.

        It was also good at that time to be working with France, with whom we have many environmental disagreements, particularly over the question of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. But here we are able to work with France and, of course, New Zealand came to this particular party as well, and this is all very good for Antarctica, which is for the world to enjoy not just the countries close to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I should like to commend the Bill both for prohibiting mining in the Australian Antarctic territory, for the prohibition of mining by Australian nationals and corporations in any part of Antarctica and for the very clear signal that this gives to the rest of the world that Australia is serious about its intention to pursue adequate protection of Antarctica. It is certainly a very clear message to some of the countries already mentioned that are proponents of mining in Antarctica, like the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan. We need to send them that very clear message through this national legislation as well as through the work that is done in international meetings on this subject. So I should like to encourage the Government to maintain its support for a comprehensive agreement on environmental protection for Antarctica, the prohibition of mining activity being just one aspect of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        My only concern with this Bill is that it may still see some forms of mining exploration continue under the guise of scientific research. There is a place for genuine research, but too much seems to be motivated by the prospect of commercial gain. This Bill, and Australia's continued efforts to gain comprehensive protection for the Antarctic environment, should help ensure Antarctica retains its wilderness qualities and is valued for that, rather than being seen as a resource to be exploited.
       </para>
       <para>
        John Burgess, the Assistant Secretary for the Environment and the Antarctic in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said just before the Chile meeting of the Antarctic treaty nations last year that the most immediate threat to Antarctica is from the effects of scientific bases and tourism. This is why Australia needs to be resolute in pursuing the protection of Antarctica, not just on the question of mining.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, Casey Station is one of the several bases in the Antarctic which has experienced an oil spill. The potential for environmental problems increases with the proliferation of bases, many of which are there largely for a political stake in Antarctica's future as well as those of course that are genuinely conducting scientific research. A large question mark still hangs over the prospective tourism developments, which should be subjected to very limited access under stringent guidelines if allowed at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main strength of this Bill is the recognition that there are some areas on planet earth that are too significant and too fragile to be put at risk by the exploitative mentality. There is a global responsibility to protect such areas, and I am glad that Australia is playing a prominent role in that attempt to protect these very fragile areas of which there are too few left. In fact, it could be argued that the Antarctic is the only real wilderness area left available for the global community to work together to protect.
       </para>
       <para>
        I look forward to the day when similar protection is afforded to all areas of global environmental significance. The protection of Australia's national parks and nature reserves would be a good starting point. This is where I need to say something about the Government on those issues, and it is especially relevant with the decision about to be made on mining at Coronation Hill in the Kakadu National Park and World Heritage area. We are in the run-up now to the next very important environmental decision to be made in the national context. Considering the debacle that we have seen with Cabinet divided over the resource security legislation and the complete sell-out that that is quite rightly judged to be, it will be very interesting indeed to see whether the Government is prepared to afford to our own special areas of environmental significance within Australia the same kind of importance that it is prepared to attach to Antarctica.

         —There are more than two, I agree: with all parties supporting it. I stand corrected. It is pleasing that this is not a matter of controversy, nor should it be. For those who attempt to score points looking at what people have previously said on this, in terms of whether to sign mining conventions or not, it should always be noted that not one person who was ever advocating the signing of a convention wanted to see mining in the Antarctic. It was always an argument about whether or not there would be a regime in place to protect the environment if a country proceeded to do the wrong thing and mine. The same objections that were made on that score two years ago are alive and well today because there is still no regime that would prevent a country marching in and doing something truly horrible in the Antarctic. That is a matter of regret for us all. Australia is working very hard to ensure that we do come up with some sort of instrument which will provide long term protection for the Antarctic and mining.

        In regard to Senator Vallentine's comments, it is worth remembering, whenever one speaks of the Antarctic and of research, that the Japanese Government can still manage to kill hundreds of whales each year-always in the name of research. That is a tragedy on a world scale which still goes on and one which we should all keep uppermost in our thoughts and attempt to stop.
       </para>
       <para>
        In specifics, the position that Australia took was regarded as somewhat radical at the time. France, Belgium and Italy have joined us now as full co-sponsors of our proposal and, at the Antarctic Treaty meeting in Chile in November last year, 12 of the 39 parties to the treaty were calling for a prohibition on mining in Antarctica. That is a considerable improvement in the space of two years, but a long way short of where Australia-and the world, I hope-would like to see it. The treaty parties are meeting again in Madrid in just over a month's time to continue those discussions. As we approach that meeting, I hope that more of our treaty partners follow the lead which Australia has taken on the issue. How meaningful a country's commitment to the Antarctic is will be determined by the stance it takes in these discussions in Madrid next month. I hope that more of the 27 parties to the treaty who still have not embraced this cause will do so very shortly.

        I will not attempt to speak on Senator Calvert's rather extraordinary and irrelevant contribution. As I said by way of interjection, the people of Australia have had ample and perfect opportunity to judge between the records of the coalition and the Government on the environment, and did so resoundingly. I think that not only do the records of the two parties speak for themselves on that question, but so does the verdict of Australia. The verdict was way against Senator Calvert. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         —The purpose of the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill 1991 is to correct a drafting mistake that was made in the 1989 amendment to the Meat Chicken Levy Act 1969. The Act, together with the Meat Chicken Levy Collection Act 1969, provides for the collection of a levy on meat chickens. The funds raised are for research via the Chicken Meat Research Trust Account and the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Trust Account.

        The 1989 amendment accidentally set the maximum rate of levy for the exotic disease purposes at 0.005c per head instead of 0.05c. The 1991 amendment is to correct the drafting error and to set the rate at 0.05c per head. Additional funds raised by the collection of the correct levy rate will be matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar-for-dollar basis and the additional funds are estimated to total $27,000 in 1991-92. On behalf of the Opposition, I support the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill 1991.

        The purpose of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill and the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 is to restructure the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and the Australian Dried Fruits Board and place them under the wing of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Bills will deregulate the domestic market by removing the domestic component of the sultana equalisation scheme but continue export underwriting for another three years to minimise the impact of the changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        These Bills are in response to the Industries Assistance Commission 1989 report on the dried vine fruits industry, which recommended the reform of existing levels of government assistance arrangements for the dried vine fruits industry. The legislation is very similar to that of the wheat industry in that the domestic market is to be regulated but export controls are to continue. The Government will continue its current underwriting scheme for another three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two pieces of legislation will change the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation into a board and place it under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The dried fruits industry would prefer not to be tied to the Australian Horticultural Corporation because it does not believe that it would receive any additional benefits. Instead, it will have additional costs to the tune of $60,000 per year for the next three years and, while there will be some subsidy to the Australian Horticultural Corporation, after that the cost to the dried fruits industry could double. This is a concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has forced the industry into the changes in order to preserve its export power. The dried fruits industry has had a long history of competing successfully in export markets, with Australian fruit attracting the highest prices on world markets. The Government has agreed to the industry retaining its independence within the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill will deregulate the domestic market and remove the domestic component from the sultana equalisation scheme. The sultana equalisation scheme was first introduced in 1982, when the world was oversupplied with sultanas and prices were extremely low. The scheme paid out $1.3m or $16 per tonne in its first year, but this has not been repeated.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1986 the scheme was changed to reduce the level at which the Government would underwrite. The level was set at 80 per cent of the free on board export return for the past three years and a sunset clause inserted so that the scheme finished at the end of December 1990. This legislation will continue underwriting for another three years to help the industry adjust to the deregulation of the domestic market. The sultana equalisation scheme was introduced many years ago to equalise the domestic and export markets so that farmers could be paid the same price for their product. Legislation in 1986 set a cap on the equalisation payment that could be made over and above the average export return. Because the domestic price in most years was above the export price, the Government and the Industry Commission believed that this was a consumer transfer. It should be noted that neither the Dried Fruits Corporation nor the Australian Dried Fruits Association actually market fruit on the domestic market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of this perceived transfer, the Government is removing the domestic component from equalisation but will continue it on the exports. This means that equalisation will be on a reconciliation of export returns at the end of each season. There will be no levies and no government financial involvement. The industry is not happy to be losing equalisation of the domestic market. It rightly points out that it is already competing on the domestic market against the heavily subsidised product from Greece and cheap, poor quality fruit from Turkey. This is with the aid of a low, decreasing tariff, which by July 1992 will be 15 per cent on a normal basis and 10 per cent on a developing country basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill 1991 will provide for the establishment of an Australian Dried Fruits Board within the Australian Horticultural Corporation. This will be done by changes to the structure of the Horticultural Corporation to provide for product boards. It is necessary because the Government will allow the dried fruits industry more autonomy than other industries currently connected to the Horticultural Corporation enjoy. This is in recognition of the excellent export marketing operations of the current Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. It should be noted that to date the Australian Horticultural Corporation has done nothing of note in the way of marketing for the industries which are currently participating under its control.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second part of the Bill sets out how the product boards will operate. The Dried Fruits Board will be the only product board, but the framework will mean that other industries can be accommodated. The product board will be a body corporate which will assist in the longstanding arrangements that the dried fruits industry already has with a number of overseas agencies and groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government says that the board will not interfere with the active private industry marketing program that the dried fruits industry runs in Australia because it will operate only on export markets. The product board will have an independent chairperson selected by the Australian Horticultural Corporation in consultation with the relevant producer organisation, and five other members selected by the relevant industry body. Three of the five must have expertise in the industry while the other two members can be drawn from more general areas. While the industry does not like being forced into the Australian Horticultural Corporation, it recognises that in order to hold its export control it must agree to the legislation. It is reasonably happy with the final structure of the board and the degree of autonomy. Its one reservation is the money it must pay to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Opposition supports the legislation.

         —In this cognate debate on the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill, the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill and the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill, the first Bill referred to by Senator Brownhill, the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill, is the result of a drafting, printing or typographical error. I am tempted to ask what happened the first time around. The Senate, as a House of review, failed to do its job. But I am not surprised, given the performance of the coalition this morning where a good deal of the coalition's chamber time was devoted to an examination of Australian Democrats' diaries and misguided reference to our policy direction. Really, such action as this is a total waste of time. It does not improve the welfare of this nation and it is really self-indulgent in the extreme. If the coalition did what it was paid to do and occasionally read some of the legislation, the Senate might be able to act as a true House of review and we would not need to waste further time in retrospective amendments such as this. I must say though, after that, that Senator Brownhill has now adequately described the amendment contained in the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill and I will not further detail that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I turn briefly to the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill. I must say that, although the dried fruit industry will be incorporated into the Australian Horticultural Corporation, nevertheless it will retain a high degree of independence, particularly over its export marketing operations, while it is within the Horticultural Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is apparent that this arrangement does reflect the industry's long history of competing successfully in export markets. That is a record of achievement which unfortunately has not always been matched by Australia's other horticultural industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        In considering the status of other industries I refer to a press release of the National Farmers Federation of 20 December 1990. It is quoted in the House of Representatives Hansard of 21 February 1991. The press release stated that the Industry Commission had miscalculated levels of assistance between agriculture and other industries throughout the economy. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        In essence, the Commission has failed to recognise that agricultural industries are being penalised by inefficiencies in other sectors in the economy, particularly in the transport, irrigation, financial services and electricity industries . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on to read:
       </para>
       <para>
        The rate of assistance, or the aggregate effect of Government intervention in industries such as sugar, rice, dairy and dried fruits, is much lower than is indicated by the Commission's current methodology.
       </para>
       <para>
        It further stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        NFF is calling on the Industry Commission to change the methodology it uses when calculating effective rates of industry assistance so that all industries are treated equally.
       </para>
       <para>
        To me perhaps the most important word was the very last word, the word `equally'. What is meant by equally? Perhaps some have painted that `equally' as the cliche `the level playing field'. However it is described, the Australian Democrats do agree with the concept of equally.
       </para>
       <para>
        When importing goods to this country we need to take into account the costs of production in the country of origin. For example, in Australia, electricity producers are required to consider the environmental effects of their activities. This society, as a whole, agrees that environmental protection measures are appropriate, and that our energy supply costs include the costs of those environmental protection measures. These environmental protection measures, of course, have been applied to those producers for the benefit of Australia as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, Australia as a whole should accept the responsibility of applying similar economic constraints to competing importers. In the same way, the other benefits of Australian society which would add to our costs of production should be paid for by the whole of society. It is important that as consumers we should not take advantage of cheap imports produced in countries that do not provide their citizens with the same sorts of social benefits that have been established in Australia. We could ensure that that advantage is not taken by applying a charge to imports equivalent to the difference between producing in Australia and producing in a country without our social benefits and obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that very old debate about free trade versus protectionism, the question should be asked: what is it that we are protecting? The answer is not that we are protecting just industries or producers. The whole style of Australian living and the fundamental privileges and obligations of being a member of our society are what we should be protecting. I cannot pretend to introduce a comprehensive list into this short debate, but such a list would include our award wages, sickness benefits, superannuation, levels of income tax, company tax, payroll tax and fuel tax, training guarantee schemes, research levies, inspection fees, contributions to municipal rates and taxes, and the costs of compliance with other socially endorsed policies such as the equal employment opportunity policy. They should all be taken into account as part of the production costs.
       </para>

        We see no evidence in the Government's industry statement that this concept has been taken seriously. It has really been ignored. Even worse, the general level of tariffs is being reduced. It is being reduced with little regard being paid to the defence of those benefits of Australian society that I have just described. In this set of Bills, we see support for, and reinforcement of, some of those benefits. The problem is that other Government policies do not complement that direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we support these Bills, because they tidy up and emphasise some of the benefits that should be part of Australian society, we note that the Government is not supporting those that are the subject of this Bill through complementary legislation that actually recognises the benefits and obligations that are attached to them.

         —In this cognate debate on the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill, the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill and the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill, it is a great pleasure to speak to the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 because the dried vine fruits industry is of great importance in Australia. It is the biggest single horticultural industry and it has a very important local influence on the area of Australia that it occupies. The 2,700-odd grower families have made an enormous contribution to the agriculture of Australia. The industry is people intensive and it is a very sound, solid and well-established modern business. A considerable number of the operators are operating on 25- to 30-acre properties, and they certainly deserve all the nationwide support that we can give them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is no better dried fruits operation in the world than here in Australia. It has become very fashionable to kick local industries and to complain about whether or not they are efficient, how efficient, and the standards by which their efficiency may be measured. But these people are real leaders in the world in many ways. They meet absolutely every criterion of efficiency that one could possibly give them. They are modern; they have excellent research and development; they use the latest methods; they are export oriented; they are well organised; they are well managed; they are most efficiently operated. I say to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who is at the table, that I am not sure what more one can ask.
       </para>
       <para>
        The growers produced, as at the last year, 64,386 tonnes of sultanas, raisins and currants, of which we in Australia consumed 28,761 tonnes and 38,292 tonnes went for export. There is considerable fluctuation in this industry. It has good years and bad years and it has good prices and poor prices. Last year the price to the packer for sultanas averaged out at $1,415 a tonne which was slightly up on the year before. The price received depends, of course, largely on seasonal conditions, the world supply situation, the quality of the goods generally, the size of the Australian crop and its effect and, as with so many other commodities in Australia now, the value of the Australian dollar.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having again been recently to have a look at some of the work that has gone on in the last few years, I was singularly impressed at the standard that those growers have now achieved relative to other growers in the world. The new developments that they have made as far as root stocks are concerned, the selection and improvement of various vines and their disease control, the total changes in irrigation methods and the use and conservation of water and fertiliser, the new methods of trellising and harvesting-all of these things show them now to be clearly leaders by miles in the world, and as such they deserve to have the full support and cooperation of Parliament and of the people generally and, hopefully, of the consumers too. I rate myself as one of the great consumers and I am pleased to go there and see the standards that they have maintained in looking after my interests as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill extends the underwriting for three years and removes the domestic component for the equalisation arrangements. This does not please the growers and they are wondering why it became necessary for the Government to take this action. The Bill will remove the levy on the sales of domestic products. The industry deserves support, as I have said before, particularly in view of the international difficulties with competing countries. Greece and the United States of America have long been competitors, but now most of all it is Turkey that looks like being the problem. Of course, while our own production, particularly our export fruit, is under very close scrutiny for standards, I often wonder whether the same scrutiny is given to the growing quality and growing standards that are adopted in countries from which we import. I believe that, as we know what the quality of the fruit is and we know how it is produced in Australia, the Australian product deserves more consideration by the retailers, the manufacturers and by the customers themselves. There is no substitute for having the best product, and we certainly know where it comes from.
       </para>
       <para>
        The industry will always face difficulties because of these international factors. I believe that it is one of those industries for which, in spite of our rush for changing anything that looks like support or protection or understanding of industries, there certainly needs to be some trigger mechanism which can be brought into play if and when it is necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cost of producing these products in Australia, of course, is not low. It cannot be low with the price structure under which we operate. But it is a price structure that the growers themselves had no part in developing and we do need to give credit for that, too. It is not reasonable to compare what something costs under Australian standards of growing with what it may cost in Turkey or Greece or somewhere else. So I just ask that the Government at all times take that into account. Those here in Australia who try to grind down the price-to subsistence level or below for many of the growers-are not the ones who have to pay the ultimate price. They really would do better to make sure that they keep the industry in a healthy condition. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation; it gives its support.

         —This is a Bill to amend section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974, which relates to mergers and acquisitions. The aim of section 50 is to prevent mergers and acquisitions which are likely to have an adverse effect on competition. It provides for the prohibition of mergers and acquisitions which would result in a corporation being in a position to dominate the market or, if it already dominates a market, that domination being strengthened. In determining whether a position would be strengthened, the section permits the aggregation of market shares of companies that are related to or associated with the acquiring corporation. The Trade Practices Commission encourages parties to contentious mergers to consult with it early and to seek authorisation. If they do not, and if the Commission believes that the merger would breach the Act, it has no option but to contest the matter in court.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has apparently introduced this Bill as a result of the events leading to the case of Trade Practices Commission v. Australian Iron and Steel and Others-reported in 1990 ATPR at page 41. It is otherwise known as the New Zealand Steel case. In its annual report of 1988-89 the Trade Practices Commission mentioned its concern that the acquisition in July 1989 of 100 per cent of New Zealand Steel by Helenus Corporation, a New Zealand consortium headed by BHP, would strengthen BHP's dominance of the Australian market for some steel products. New Zealand Steel was a boutique producer with serious operational problems and debt of around $600m. BHP, through its wholly owned subsidiary Australian Iron and Steel, acquired 31 per cent of Helenus.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association, Mr Steve Harrison, immediately accused BHP of deliberately restricting the amount of steel production in Australia, thereby creating shortfalls to justify importing huge amounts of steel. He described BHP's investment in Helenus, to double the output of New Zealand Steel and meet a steel shortage in Australia, as scandalous. BHP's chief executive confirmed that steel produced in New Zealand would be used to bridge a shortage of about 100,000 tonnes of coated steel products.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission noted that New Zealand steel was at that time a very small supplier to the Australian market, but that it had expansion potential to supply a significant proportion of the market for hot rolled, cold rolled and coated steel products.
       </para>
       <para>
        In August 1989 the Trade Practices Commission applied to the Trade Practices Tribunal for a declaration under section 50a (1) that the acquisition would substantially strengthen BHP's dominance of the Australian market for some steel products. The Trade Practices Commission believed that BHP would effectively be able to control the Helenus consortium. This would have been the first testing of section 50a in court.
       </para>
       <para>
        In early September the Trade Practices Commission withdrew its section 50a action against BHP from the Trade Practices Tribunal and began an action under section 50 in the Federal Court of Australia. The change of forum was due to fresh legal advice which pointed out that the only remedy available under the untested section 50a was the prevention of the operation of the Australian subsidiary of New Zealand Steel; whereas under section 50 the remedy sought could be the forced divestiture of BHP's shares in New Zealand Steel.
       </para>
       <para>
        The issue of the New Zealand Steel case centred on the prohibition in section 50 against a corporation directly or indirectly acquiring shares in a body corporate if this would lead to market domination. It was held by Mr Justice Lockhart at first instance that a corporation does not indirectly acquire shares in a body corporate where the shares are acquired by a subsidiary, unless that subsidiary acts as agent for the corporation. In this case, it could not be said that BHP or Australian Iron and Steel directly or indirectly acquired shares in New Zealand Steel as there was no allegation that Helenus acquired the shares as agent for any other corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission formed the view that the Act required amendment to deal with this problem. In the end it discontinued proceedings in the New Zealand Steel case, having come to a settlement in which the Trade Practices Commission, BHP and Australian Iron and Steel gave various undertakings to the court. Although to continue the case would have provided an opportunity to test fully the adequacy of section 50 in these situations, the Commission decided that a settlement was a satisfactory market solution and a means of avoiding protracted and costly litigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission and the Government have persisted in the view that the finding in the New Zealand Steel case opened a loophole and exposed an inadequacy in section 50 which had not hitherto been apparent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition does not share this view. The case followed previous authority and confirmed the existing state of the law, although it has been treated by the Government as though it had disclosed a major defect in the legislation which required urgent remedial action in the national interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has since been pressing the Government for an amendment addressing the situation where mergers are sought through indirect acquisitions. Indeed, the Commission went so far as to encourage speculation that the case had opened a loophole of which News Ltd could take advantage to acquire the Fairfax newspaper group.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is noteworthy that News Corporation has not at any stage since the New Zealand Steel case evinced any intention of using that decision as a basis for attempting acquisition of Fairfax. This, in any case, would have been prevented by the current law. It could not acquire assets or shares in Fairfax directly; it could not acquire them through subsidiaries acting as agents of News Ltd, and even an attempt to acquire shares or assets through subsidiaries not acting as their agents would be thwarted by the aggregation provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has concerns about the Trade Practices Commission's playing the role of initiator in the policy making process to this extent. Naturally, the Commission has a role in commenting on the operation of the Trade Practices Act; but it should not lose sight of the fact that it is primarily a law enforcement body and not a policy making one.
       </para>
       <para>
        In response to the agitation of the Trade Practices Commission, the Government has introduced this Bill. Under proposed new subsection 50(1aa) the prohibition on acquisitions which would lead or would be likely to lead to market domination is extended to apply to bodies corporate which are not corporations but which are related to or associated with a corporation. The market position of all such related bodies corporate can be taken into account and aggregated in assessing dominance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The object of the new provision is to prevent bodies corporate which are not corporations acquiring shares or assets where a corporation itself would be prohibited from acquisition. This is in order to prevent the use of bodies corporate that are not corporations to avoid section 50. It is interesting that the Government has not given any examples of non-corporations which are bodies corporate being used by a corporation to acquire shares or assets in contravention of the section. It would seem that the chances of this happening are very slight.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Opposition accepts that there is a need, however slight, for the substantive change introduced in proposed subsection 50(1aa), the Opposition has serious reservations about its retrospectivity. These concerns are shared by the Law Council of Australia which stated in a submission to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy):
       </para>
       <para>
        Retrospectivity in legislation of this kind is always objectionable and the practice is especially objectionable where, as in the original announcement, the public was not given any indication of the nature of the changes which were proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General announced last October that legislation was to be introduced which would take effect from the date of the announcement. There was no explanation of the proposed content of the Bill. In the Bill, as eventually proposed, the commencement date was given as the date of the second reading speech, which was 21 December. This was later adjusted to 22 December.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Bill was actually introduced, it did not even address the problem which the Attorney-General had announced needed to be rectified so urgently. It is likely to affect so few cases that the Government has not so far given any examples of the situations in which it would apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a question relating to the constitutionality of the new provision in proposed subsection 50(1aa) in that it seeks to regulate bodies corporate which are not corporations. Thus it cannot logically fall within the Commonwealth power to make laws with respect to corporations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill also makes other changes with respect to section 50. The Law Council has made a detailed submission in relation to those changes, arguing that the need for most of them is not apparent and, further, that they could have unforeseen effects on the delicate balance of section 50 and could create commercial uncertainty.
       </para>
       <para>
        My colleague the shadow Minister for corporate law reform and consumer affairs, Mr Costello, raised each of the Law Council's points in his speech on the second reading in the other place. The Attorney-General addressed these issues in some detail in his reply, and I do not propose to canvass them again at this stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        These comments in relation to the defects of this Bill should not be taken as detracting from the Opposition's basic position in relation to legal constraints on market monopolisation in a free market economy, which is that there is a place for establishing rules so that the market operates in a fair and efficient way, and so that free and open competition is promoted. We have in the past supported trade practices provisions which are designed to promote these objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        For these reasons, and because the substantive change in proposed new paragraph 50 (1aa) does close what could in the future become a loophole which would be useful to those who are seeking to avoid the anti-monopolisation provisions in section 50, the Opposition is not opposing this Bill.

         —A major change is under way in the Parliament of one of our Pacific neighbours and I consider that it should not go unnoticed in our chamber. The nation to which I refer is Western Samoa-a country of about 163,000 people. Western Samoa's islands are part of the Samoan archipelago, which was first surveyed by the French during the late eighteenth century.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Relations between the Samoan islands and Western powers during the first century of contact were dominated by missionary and trading activities. Internal conflict and disruption caused by rival Western powers in the late nineteenth century led to the island group becoming controlled by the United States in the east and by Germany in the west. Following the outbreak of World War I, Western Samoa was controlled by New Zealand, first as an occupied area, then as a territory, and finally as a United Nations trust territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        After Western Samoa became independent from the New Zealand administration in 1962, it adopted a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. But there was one major concession to tradition in that, with one minor exception, only the nation's chiefs were allowed to stand and vote in general elections. The Legislative Assembly, or Fono, has 47 seats, of which two are reserved for non-Samoan citizens; the other 45 may be contested by chiefs only. The chiefs, referred to as matai, are heads of extended family groups and are leaders in a country which adheres rigidly to the traditional Polynesian way of life. The matai hold great authority, and that authority begins at the village level, which is the heart of all Samoan political, social and economic life. It extends to all sections of the Samoan commercial, public service and political structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last year the Prime Minister of Western Samoa, Tofilau Eti Alesana, called on Western Samoan adults to decide whether universal suffrage should be introduced. Voting in the referendum to gauge opinion on this matter was open to all Western Samoans of age 21 and over. The Prime Minister noted that there had been a big rise in the number of matai and this had diluted their authority. Some matai with political ambitions apparently had created new titles for family members to win more votes. It seems to be the equivalent of branch stacking in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        After a short campaign in which the pros and cons were debated, a one person, one vote system was approved by a narrow majority. The Western Samoan Parliament has now been dissolved and next month a new parliament will be elected by universal suffrage. An estimated 60,000 adults will be eligible to vote compared with 20,000 matai who previously had sole voting rights. Perhaps to those of us who are accustomed to a system of universal suffrage, this does not seem to be a major step; but it certainly is for a country whose whole culture has been based on the family and extended family groups and the authority of the matai.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the forthcoming election will be held under a system of universal suffrage, except for the two non-Samoan seats the right to stand as a candidate will remain restricted to matai. This restriction may appear undemocratic if the situation is viewed from a Western perspective. But having taken what is for Western Samoa a major step towards democracy, it seems reasonable to support a statement by that country's Prime Minister. On the matter of retaining the exclusive rights of parliamentary representation to the matai, he is reported to have said, `You can't overnight change the whole system. Let's take it easy this time'. The Prime Minister, however, has not ruled out that there could be non-matai candidates in future elections.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1989 I had the opportunity to visit Western Samoa twice. I found the people and the country delightful. There is little wonder that Robert Louis Stevenson chose Western Samoa to be his home. Between 1892 and 1896 he completed eight works in Western Samoa. Two were unfinished at the time of his tragic early death. If he had not been stricken by a cerebral haemorrhage at the age of 44, Western Samoa through Stevenson would have made a considerable further contribution to English literature.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much of Western Samoa's agricultural land is held for the production of subsistence crops, but bananas, cacao and copra are among the nation's exports. Dominated by two major islands, Upolu and Savai'i, the nation's economy is largely based on agriculture, fishing, timber getting and tourism.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite a relatively low cash income, the people of Western Samoa maintain a high standard of both health and literacy due to the provision of good health and educational services by their Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The traditional Polynesian culture and Christianity are strongly supported by the Government of Western Samoa. Examples of the influence of Christianity on the people of Western Samoa are the strict observance of Sunday and evening vesper curfews in the villages. Indeed, on the first occasion on which I visited Western Samoa, I arrived on a Sunday morning. On the long drive from the international airport to the capital, Apia, it was delightful to see so many Western Samoans, in their Sunday best, walking to their local church. I did not count those churches, but there were scores on that 40-kilometre drive.

        On my second visit to Western Samoa, in a memorable ceremony Senator Reid and I were inducted as chiefs. My title was `Ulufanua' or, in English, `head of the land', and Senator Reid's was `Suailefanua' or `juice of the land'-slightly more prosaic. After acquiring this chiefly status, I asked whether I was then eligible to take a seat in the country's Legislative Assembly. Our hosts had probably never been asked that before, but remarked that there was probably a constitutional provision preventing it.
       </para>

        Many observers will be interested in the outcome of the forthcoming elections in Western Samoa. Whatever the results, I am sure that many people will wish Western Samoa well as it involves all adults in the parliamentary process.

         —I rise today to speak briefly about Dr Eugene Forsey, a man who has been described as one of Canada's foremost experts on that country's constitution. I first came into contact with Dr Forsey's writings when he wrote the epilogue to Sir John Kerr's famous book Matters for Judgement. I was sorry to read in a recent edition of Time magazine of his death on 27 February at the age of 86. Time magazine described him as Canada's foremost constitutional expert and a prolific author of scholarly books.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Because of the importance of his work and his links with Australia, it is appropriate that Dr Forsey's passing be noted by the Senate. Dr Forsey was a committed socialist, and senators will not be surprised that I have been more attracted by his constitutional writings than by his party philosophy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Eugene Forsey was born in Newfoundland in 1904. He was a Rhodes scholar for Quebec in 1926 and took his MA at Oxford in 1932. On his return to Canada, he became actively involved in politics. He was one of the founders of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation which later became the New Democratic Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was one of those socialists who combined a zeal for social and industrial reform along socialist lines with a reverence for the constitutional heritage which all the Commonwealth countries inherited from Great Britain. In particular, Dr Eugene Forsey was an ardent supporter of the institution of the monarchy and regarded the sovereign and the governors and governors-general of the Commonwealth as an essential part of a system of responsible democratic parliamentary government. He believed this to be the finest system of government ever devised, and with that view I have some sympathy.
       </para>
       <para>
        He wrote a great deal on constitutional and political subjects. His most famous work, published in 1943, is The Royal Power of Dissolution of Parliament in the British Commonwealth. This was a detailed treatment of the power of the Crown in the constitutional arrangements of Commonwealth countries, particularly as it relates to the granting of dissolutions of parliament. In compiling this work-which is still, I believe, regarded as an authoritative treatment of the subject-Dr Forsey had the benefit of a scholarly work by another well-known socialist and constitutional lawyer. It will not be a surprise to you, Mr Deputy President, that this man was Dr H.V. Evatt, who had published his equally well known book The King and His Dominion Governors in 1936.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two books, one by Dr Evatt and the other by Eugene Forsey, became associated as the great works on the subject of the reserve powers of the Crown, and in 1990 they were reprinted in a single volume with an introduction by Dr Forsey providing an up-to-date summary of the subject. Dr Forsey's constant theme was that the reserve powers of the Crown, particularly in granting a dissolution, were an essential safeguard of democratic constitutional government. He attacked what he called the `rubber stamp' theory of the Crown-the theory that the head of state is always obliged, regardless of the circumstances, to act on the advice of the ministry of the day. He amassed a vast collection of precedents from all around the Commonwealth to support his defence of reserve powers.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this chamber a debate on reserve powers has extended over a long period. It is worth recording in this chamber the views of Dr Forsey on this subject. In scholarly discussion and political controversy, Dr Forsey always had at his fingertips telling examples of cases in which reserve powers had been exercised properly or improperly. He was always able to pose embarrassing questions, supported by practical examples, for the proponents of the `rubber stamp' theory. What if a government refused to resign or to go to an election when it lost its majority in the Lower House? What if it lost an election but insisted upon holding another election? Dr Forsey saw these reserve powers of the Crown as a safeguard against such unconstitutional actions, and he employed his great skills as a writer and as an advocate to hammer home his views far and wide. It is of interest to quote from him directly on the use of the reserve power:
       </para>
       <para>
        The reserve power is, indeed, under our Constitution, an absolutely essential safeguard of democracy . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the rubber stamp theory which is undemocratic. It makes existing governments irremovable except by their own consent. Such a doctrine is a travesty of democracy. It delivers every Opposition gagged and bound into the hands of its opponents. It delivers the people gagged and bound into the hands of any jack-in-office.
       </para>
       <para>
        To use Dr Forsey's terms,
       </para>
       <para>
        The jack-in-office may, of course, loosen the gag and the ropes. He may loosen them so much that we don't realize they're there. But he can tighten them again whenever he pleases, and as tight as he pleases. This is not democracy. It is despotism; more or less benevolent, perhaps, for the moment; but despotism none the less.

       <para>
        Because of Dr Forsey's great interest in constitutional history and doctrine, he became involved in the debate over the 1975 constitutional crisis in Australia. Although he might have been expected to be ideologically in sympathy with the Labor Government, he unreservedly supported the correctness of the action of Sir John Kerr in dismissing the Whitlam Government to allow the electorate to determine the deadlock between the two Houses of Parliament. In an epilogue to Sir John Kerr's book Matters for Judgment, which I have mentioned, Dr Forsey wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        Never for a moment did I doubt the correctness of the action Sir John Kerr took. For the life of me, I could not see, and still cannot see, what else he could have done in the circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The duty of a Prime Minister denied supply by an Upper House is either to resign, or to advise a dissolution of the Lower House.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Forsey was appointed to the Canadian Senate in 1970 by Prime Minister Trudeau. As a senator he diligently applied the doctrine of the accountability of the executive government to Parliament. He was particularly active in seeking to reassert parliamentary control over delegated legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his retirement he continued to take part in constitutional controversies. He strongly opposed the 1987 Meech Lake accord, which would have recognised Quebec as a distinct society in Canada. The accord, as we know, failed to gain the required approval; and as senators will be aware, the Quebec issue in Canadian politics is still unresolved.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Eugene Forsey had a great affection for Australia and for Australians, I understand, and a great interest, as I have shown, in Australian affairs. It is fitting that we should mark his passing and remember his work in the Australian Senate.

        <para in-line="1">
         —Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you will be interested in the issue that I want to raise in the Senate today. It concerns natural disaster relief arrangements, and relates particularly to the extensive damage that we know has been suffered by local councils around Queensland following the quite unusual heavy rainfall over the last few months. I emphasise at the outset that we are talking about a very exceptional year when it comes to the kind of damage that has been done by rainfall, and I believe that the natural disaster relief arrangements should take this into account.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In this place on 13 February I raised with my colleague the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, the question of whether the assistance measures that have been agreed to by the Federal and State governments should perhaps be more flexible and should include assistance for damage caused to roads and other areas by saturation. Under the current guidelines, flooding is flooding and relates to water that floods across roads and is responsible for damage; but rain saturation is another issue entirely and does not qualify for any relief. This is a considerable source of concern and frustration to local government. Frankly, unless people can see the examples, it is very difficult to comprehend this subtle difference between flooding and saturation; but one can certainly see it when one inspects the damage, as I am sure many of us have done in recent weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following my raising this issue in the Senate, Senator Button indicated that the Department would investigate the need for some kind of flexibility, and the issue has been taken up by the Department of Finance on the instructions of the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis. I take this opportunity to thank Minister Willis for his interest. Officers of his Department subsequently met with me to gain some greater detail of what the concerns were. I asked the Local Government Association of Queensland to document, from their point of view, their understanding of the frustrations of councils, with some hard evidence of the kinds of claims that had been rejected in the past. I have, as honourable senators can see, several examples from all over Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to read into the Hansard a copy of the letter from Greg Hoffman, the Executive Director of the Local Government Association of Queensland, because it indicates that this is not a one-off short term problem that has just been experienced by one council.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to our recent conversation on the shortcomings of the natural disaster relief arrangements. These arrangements are a constant source of concern to local government in Queensland and we fully support your initiative to have them reviewed following the exceptional damage caused in Queensland during the current wet season.
       </para>
       <para>
        The particular problem of rain water damage has been raised on previous occasions and attached are documents to this effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other elements of the guidelines which are of concern are firstly, the exclusion of damage to water and sewerage facilities because they are regarded as business undertakings-
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask honourable senators what their view is of that particular decision, water and sewerage facilities being regarded as business undertakings. I would have thought that they were fundamental to public health and should not be regarded as business undertakings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point in the letter is that the beach restoration programs arising from damage caused by tidal surge are also excluded from the guidelines and therefore no financial assistance can be given to councils for restoring the coastline. Given our increased level of commitment and awareness of environmental issues, I think that is certainly an area for review. The third thing mentioned is the removal of concessional loan facilities to local government for the establishment of permanent water augmentation facilities necessitated by extreme and protracted drought. Having talked about the problems of flooding, that is another issue that Mr Hoffman wishes to raise.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to get back to this apparent anomaly in regard to damage caused by flooding and damage caused by saturation. I would like to read from another letter from the Local Government Association of Queensland, this one sent two years ago to the Director-General of the Premier's Department in Queensland following the flooding after cyclone Charlie. The councils' grievances then were similar. They mainly concerned certain sections of the guidelines for natural disaster relief arrangements which they believe are too stringent. They wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Association hopes that your office will take this matter into consideration during the next review of the guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        By far the most frequent complaint had to do with problems in the definition of drainage systems. Under the guidelines councils can only claim damage to that caused by water crossing roadways rather than damage resulting from longitudinal flow.
       </para>
       <para>
        Councils said that during heavy rain watercourses change direction of flow and create new watercourses along the roads. The longitudinal flow of water along a road causes scarring to the roadway pavements but this damage is not eligible for flood relief.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some councils complained that the definition of flood submergence was too severe in that damage can still occur to road surfaces during periods of cyclonic rains.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must confess that the response from the Premiers Department at that time, in 1988, was less than satisfactory, from both a State point of view and a Federal point of view. The then Acting Director-General replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        Damage from heavy rainfall resulting in longitudinal water flows or pavement break-up is presently ineligible as the guidelines restrict eligible restoration works to damage caused by flooding.
       </para>
       <para>
        By way of explanation the Commonwealth determination of the terms and conditions of natural disaster assistance only recognises flooding (and not rainfall run-off) as eligible for assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Approaches to Canberra for inclusion of rainfall/saturation damage have received negative responses. The Commonwealth contends that damage of this nature indicates a deficiency in design or construction standard.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am afraid that that sort of statement would be absolutely rejected by councils and would, I am sure, be absolutely rejected by anybody who has lived through extensive flooding in tropical areas of Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very easy to make those comments from a government department here on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin, where people do not experience tropical downpours. Obviously this has been a longstanding problem, and it is long overdue for reconsideration. Therefore, I am pleased to be able to advise that following that initial question and the discussions of a few weeks ago, the Department of Finance has now written to its equivalent Queensland department stating:
       </para>
       <para>
        We seek your advice as to how the arrangements regarding submergence/saturation are being or will be applied in the current exceptional storm/cyclonic events in northern Queensland, and your views as to whether some additional flexibility in the arrangements as practised in the past is warranted.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the complaint of the Local Government Association is that that flexibility has not been present, because the guidelines have been too stringent, and rain damage and the effect of watertables rising has not been recognised. The letter continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        We also note in a recent phone conversation you indicated that assistance would be provided to Mackay due to the extent of submergence in the wake of Cyclone Joy. A request for assistance for rain damage . . . was apparently judged not to meet existing guidelines. Details on this development, particularly in respect to Mackay and Townsville regions, would be appreciated as part of your response to this request.
       </para>
       <para>
        As previously discussed, an officer of the Department of Finance is available to visit affected areas to examine damage first hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to inform the Senate that it appears that after a number of years of bureaucratic rigidity and lack of understanding the quite different conditions that apply in tropical Australia at times such as we have had over the last couple of months will perhaps at long last be recognised. This does not mean that every time it rains, in Queensland or anywhere else, councils can rush in with special claims. There would have to be a declaration of a natural disaster, and the level of rainfall during that disaster would have to be examined so that it could be determined whether it qualified for consideration as an exceptional period of rain. But I hope that there is a positive outcome to the work that a number of people have been doing on behalf of local government; because if people had seen the conditions that have resulted from this absolutely unprecedented level of rainfall, they would understand why councils will have to undergo very serious financial hardship to start to repair the damage. When we are dealing with roads, obviously, if we do not repair the damage that is a risk to the community. Our road toll is high enough as it is, without any delay in repairing such flood damaged or rain damaged roads.

         —It seems rather appropriate, Madam Acting Deputy President, that you are occupying the chair at this time. I want to bring to the Senate's attention a number of points. I begin with a quote from an article from yesterday's Australian, `Kerin defends decision on wheat submission'. I find in it a very remarkable statement, which needs correcting and refuting. Talking about Minister Kerin, it said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        He said farmers had to realise that it was not easy to introduce microeconomic reform quickly in the area of off-farm costs when the Government naturally had to represent union interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is an absolutely extraordinary statement in terms of where we are, and I want to go through that a little.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to remind the Senate that, during recent elections since the Hawke Government has been in office, I have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stand up in front of the television cameras and say, `We are now elected as the Government of Australia and we are here to govern for all Australians'. I have also seen it in Western Australia with our Premiers; both the now infamous ex-Premiers Burke and Dowding have made similar statements. I view this as a very serious situation. The impact of it, if it is taken a little bit further, is that in essence it is including not just farmers but all non-unionists.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to run through some of the impacts of these sorts of statements on the community. Firstly, they create a compromise. They denigrate a percentage of Australians by classifying them as second-class citizens. They mean that effective micro-economic reform will be compromised in such areas as labour market reform, the waterfront, transport industries, trans-Tasman shipping, coastal shipping, airlines and communications.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the context of the debate on that particular subject, I think Minister Kerin should publicly disown or withdraw that statement, or he should identify the Ministers who perpetuated it. It is that type of statement from a key resource Minister that makes it very difficult for Australia to tackle some of its serious problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to use the remainder of my time to comment on what Mr Kerin said in the press release on the wheat industry assistance package. In the second paragraph of the media release it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``I am well aware of the serious difficulties being faced by many wheat farmers in Australia. These have been caused by the severe drop in world prices resulting from record world production and the aggressive production and export subsidy practices of the EC and US,'' Mr Kerin said today.
       </para>
       <para>
        First of all, in terms of record production, there is no question that there has been a good year in terms of production, but what we have to look at, to keep it in context, is that on the last figures I had there were less than 50 days supply of wheat around the world. So the problem is not overproduction through the good harvest. The problem relates back first of all to the practices of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the United States (US) and our failure to address effectively some of the things that I identified earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to comment on the basis of a submission from the Grains Council of Australia. I do not want to talk about it in the context of arguing for or against it, but in the context of what it is doing to Australian industry. In terms of the practices of the EEC and the US, we saw that the dairy industry was first hit. If we go back 10 or 12 years ago, Australia had a thriving export dairy industry. Many people were involved in that industry. Through the policies that have been developed through the common agricultural policy (CAP) program and the other programs in the US, we have slowly seen our dairy industry totally destroyed as an export contributor. We are now seeing a similar situation in the wheat industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The argument that the Grains Council put, which as I understand it was developed with the Minister's office, was that it was asking in principle for some system to give it a defence against price injury caused by the secondary effects of countervailing or dumping actions by overseas countries. I believe that we need to look very carefully at this. It certainly has to be looked at carefully by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) as Minister representing Minister Kerin in this place. Particularly now that there is an effective program in place in terms of lowering tariffs, one has to ask what will be the next industry affected. Will it be the car industry? Will it be the steel industry? Will it be the timber industry? One by one they can get picked off.
       </para>
       <para>
        I recognise the efforts that are being made through the Cairns Group, but at this particular time its efforts are not sufficient. We have to come up with a mechanism to protect our wheat industry at this particular time because of actions which are totally outside its control.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall just run through the figures of the contribution the wheat industry has made to our export earnings over the last 10 years. It amounted to $2.17 billion in 1979-80; $1.72 billion in 1980-81; $1.79 billion in 1981-82; $1.44 billion in 1982-83; $1.813 billion in 1983-84; $2.86 billion in 1984-85; $2.9 billion in 1985-86; $2.1 billion in 1986-87; $1.774 billion in 1987-88; and $2.1 billion in the season just past, 1988-89. We have not as yet got the figures for the crop that has just been harvested. We are looking at an industry that has been consistently in the top three or four, and often at the top of our list, in terms of the earnings of export dollars. The challenge we have currently is how we are going to give that industry a defence mechanism to get over the activities that are occurring in the trade war.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, it has to be looked at in the context of the damage that can be done to other industries. One could certainly run into the horticultural industries, and it has absolutely decimated our dairy industry. That has had particular effect in a number of States but I guess the principal one would be Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we move to a more competitive Australia-hopefully-if we do not work out how we are going to handle this particular problem and have a defence mechanism there in terms of anti-dumping and countervailing provisions, it will be only a matter of time before we will see other countries get into this. I am not suggesting when I mention some countries that they may or may not do it, but one can well imagine, for example, what Japan could do to our car industry, when it starts exporting, if it wanted to adopt the same type of policies, if we have not worked out a strategy by which we are going to handle it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I move now to the other points that I wanted to raise in terms of the wheat industry assistance statement. In the fourth paragraph it says that approximately $100m will be injected into the industry through an extension of the Government's guarantee of Australian Wheat Board borrowings. I want to explain precisely what that means. It means that growers will receive approximately $6 per tonne for ASW wheat of 10 per cent protein, which is the bulk of Australian wheat. It does not mean, because it is a guarantee on borrowings, that there will be any Government hand-out in it. And while the industry appreciates the fact that the Government has made this facility available, it does mean in the long term that that $6 will be discounted to make up for the costs of servicing that particular loan.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the question that I address to the Government here, particularly in the knowledge that we have seen the price this year on their original estimates fall some $40-odd per tonne, is why could not this facility also be put in place to inject income into the industry, into the growers' pockets? That would enable them to start planning for their program this year. It would restimulate our various businesses that supply the wheat industry, whether they be in the country towns or in the metropolitan areas, with regard to the 1988-89 pool and the 1989-90 pool, because a significant amount of equity is left in that. If the same provision could be applied to those two particular pools, it would significantly improve the prospects of many of the service industries that service the wheat industry and, of course, the wheat growers in it.

        The survey figures show that in the present circumstances we are looking at a planting reduced by about 35 per cent on the current harvest; that is, a 35 per cent reduction for the current seeding program which goes into next year's harvest. The figures average out somewhere just over $2 billion per annum over the last 10 years, but this has the potential to reduce that figure to the lowest it has been for many years, to probably about $1.3 billion. This would have a disastrous impact on our current account figures for the year.

        The next point I want to raise in terms of this statement-and it has been raised here in questions-relates to the shortfall on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) payment on wheat which was sold to Iraq prior to sanctions being imposed. A significant amount of wheat was sold there. Payments were held up by virtue of the fact that the assets of Iraq were frozen in the United States of America. The Government needs to give the industry a straight answer in terms of that $123m as to whether, as the Prime Minister said, the costs will be borne across the nation and not by any one individual industry or whether the wheat industry will have to pick up that $123m shortfall which is not covered by the EFIC insurance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last point I want to raise-and once again it relates to this particular media release and the Grains Council's defence strategy-is in the second last paragraph. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures announced today are consistent with Australia's key role in the Uruguay Round negotiations which have reached a critical stage, and will ensure that our efficient grain producers will be able to respond to a future upturn in the world grains market.
       </para>
       <para>
        I certainly do not deny that the Uruguay Round has reached a very critical stage; it is in its eleventh hour. If something does not come out of the next two or three months, I think this particular round will fail totally in addressing the problems of world trade in agriculture.
       </para>
       <para>
        I point out here that inherent in that statement is a suggestion that if the Government had given consideration to this proposal, it would have been in breach of the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That is clearly not the case. Rule 4 covers quite precisely the proposition that was put forward as far as the Grains Council was concerned. The Government should have a second look at that particular aspect of the statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I return to the point I made at the beginning that Minister Kerin should either disown or withdraw that statement. Secondly, I want to put the emphasis on the necessity for Australia to get in place a strategy on how we are to handle the types of actions that are going on in world trade. As I said when I started, we have seen the dairy industry decimated, and we see the wheat industry being hurt very badly now. I wind up by posing the question: what will be next? Will it be the car industry, the steel industry, the timber industry or some other industry? Right now we are very vulnerable because we do not have a policy on it and we do not have a strategy on it.

         —I rise to pay tribute to a great person, a great Australian, who died on 18 December last year. I refer to Commissioner Fred Brown of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Although Fred was a friend of mine for over 30 years, I do not intend to use words of my own on this occasion in this Parliament. Instead I intend to rely almost entirely on the eloquent tribute to Fred Brown delivered by his son Gerard at the requiem mass in Immaculate Conception Church, Hawthorn, on 21 December 1990.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Fred Brown was born in the Queensland sugar town of Nambour in 1928. He was the eldest of nine children and a seventh generation Australian. His ancestors arrived in Australia in 1792. His family grew up during the Depression and the Second World War. His mother died in 1941 when he was only 13 years of age. He was then already at work on the Brisbane waterfront as an apprentice shipwright, and his father was at war in the Persian Gulf and later in the North Sea and the Arctic Circle. Consequently, it was largely left to Fred Brown to support and hold together his family during and after the war years.
       </para>
       <para>
        By the end of World War II, the work of a shipwright had been permanently changed by the demands of the war and the introduction of new materials and new technology. He worked hard to re-establish the craft and was elected State Secretary of the Shipwrights Union at 20 years of age. He was the youngest trade union secretary in Australia and was later made a life member of that union. At the same time, he became involved in the Labor movement in Queensland. He established Young Labor, of which he was elected State and then later Federal Secretary.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsequently, Fred Brown came to Melbourne to work for four years with a well-known Jesuit and lifelong friend, Father Desmond O'Connor, at Messenger House in Richmond. His reputation as an advocate and industrial officer resulted in his being recalled to Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the many years in Queensland he worked with the Federated Ironworkers Association under Laurie Short and Harry Hurrell, in the Clothing Trades Union, the Queensland Combined Industrial Unions Council, the Federated Clerks Union, the Australian Workers Union, and many other unions. During his travels in these years he met his wife Elsie in Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1961 he was appointed the first full time union official in Papua New Guinea as General Secretary of the Public Service Association. His oft repeated aim in Papua New Guinea was to make himself redundant by so organising the workers and training the local people to run the PSA and to protect its own members as to make himself redundant. He headed the Papua New Guinea public sector union for four years and was the second Australian after Arthur Calwell to be made a life member of the Papua New Guinea Workers Association.
       </para>
       <para>
        He returned to Queensland in 1964 and was elected Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union and President of the Queensland Combined Industrial Unions Council. He headed both organisations for almost a decade. For about four years, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he served on the Immigration Advisory Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1972 Fred Brown was appointed to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, one of only six members to be appointed under an application and selection procedure operating at the time. He was one of the Commission's youngest ever members. As indicated in the report that was presented to us last year by the Commission, Commissioner Brown at the time of his death was its senior Commissioner. He swore his oath of appointment on the Bible his mother had brought with her to Australia from Scotland. He was always immensely proud of his appointment. He had a dedication to the institution of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        For almost 20 years he was made responsible at different times for all of Australia's key industrial sectors. He was responsible for industrial relations on major national projects such as the North West Shelf, the Melbourne underground and the Westgate Bridge, and for a considerable period he was the Commissioner responsible in the area of the building of the new Parliament House, this Parliament House. For that reason, too, it is most fitting that we remember Fred Brown.
       </para>
       <para>
        He convened the first joint sitting of the Federal Commission and a State industrial tribunal with Commissioner Bob Saker of the Victorian Commission, hearing building industry matters from November 1975 until November 1976. Whilst several of his decisions were appealed, none was ever overturned. That says a lot about Fred Brown's knowledge, experience and wisdom.
       </para>
       <para>
        He had a great interest in the work of State industrial commissions. I know that when he visited Tasmania he would consistently contact members of the Commission there to see how things were going. He would consistently contact trade unions and employer organisations. He was deeply interested in ensuring that the system worked for the benefit of not only those who were parties to awards but also the community as a whole. Over many years he became involved in the education of industrial relations students and in 1989 was practitioner in residence at the University of Melbourne. He also participated in training overseas students brought to Australia for studies in industrial relations by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could add to Gerard's remarks by enumerating many other achievements of Fred Brown, but time does not permit that. And in any event, as Gerard said, a recitation of what Fred did does not really explain why he was the man he was. He was driven to sacrifice much of his private life to promote and defend and apply Catholic social justice principles which figured prominently in his life. It was the application of those principles in his life which earned him the affection of many and the respect of all, and it is that for which he will be remembered.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although his working career was the public part of his life, his family, his religious convictions and his commitment to social justice were what he cherished most, and for which he will be most remembered. He was indeed a family man. He was a loving husband, father and brother to his extended family and a friend to many of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply convey-I am sure this would be echoed by people around the chamber-our deepest sympathy to his wife Elsie and to his daughters Catherine, Georgina, Helen and Philippa, to his son Gerard and to his sisters and brothers and extended family. Fred left his mark on all of us. He was indeed a good man, a good Australian. I was most honoured to be at his funeral, with the vast number of people who were there, praying and commending him to the faithful love of the Lord.

At the time of his funeral, I did send condolences, as Minister for Industrial Relations, to his family; but I can say, from my knowledge of him on the Bench as a Commissioner, that he was a very fine example of what we in Australia aspire to as human beings and a fine example of the ideal of an arbitration commissioner, in that this was a man without a great deal of formal education, a man who was self-taught; a scholar notwithstanding the lack of formality to his scholarship, and therefore a learned person, but wise in the ways of the world and able to bring a street wisdom to his decisions which reflected an understanding of the life of the common person. I think that that shines through many of his written decisions and is a tribute to him, because he is indeed a model for what other Commissioners should be. I am happy to endorse the remarks of Senator Harradine.

I again stress that it is very important to distinguish the consequences or effects of a recession from a program of tariff cuts, further tariff reductions which will commence in 1993. Senator Durack asks me if I accept that, as a result of the tariff cuts, some manufacturing establishments will go out of business. The answer to that question is yes, because in this country we cannot sustain-and I thought this was the view of the Opposition, expressed by Dr Hewson and Mr John Howard and others-businesses, for example, which have 100 per cent labour cost disadvantages with countries with which we trade. We cannot sustain in this country all the business infrastructure which we have had in the past for those sorts of reasons. What we can do is create new businesses and new industries, and indeed that process has been happening. Through a period of tariff cuts in the 1980s, we saw very substantial growth in some sectors of Australian business and particularly-

         —The honourable senator ought to be interested. If he is not interested in history, he had better doze off again because I am going to give him a bit. The bit of history I am going to give him is that for the first time in 30 years, in the 1980s, manufacturing employment grew substantially in this country. If one looks at the consequences of the recession, of course, it has halted that growth and resulted in reduced employment. Until 1990-indeed, the end of 1990-manufacturing employment in this country grew for the first time. That was because there was a program of structural change in industry under way and because for the first time, year after year, manufacturing exports increased. If the honourable senator wants to know about it in any particular industry-if he is not interested in history-he should ask me as to how manufacturing employment has increased. The answer to Senator Durack's question is yes. Of course, with changes to the tariff regime which will commence in 1993, a whole range of other issues which are of importance to the competitiveness of manufacturers have to be continually looked at.

        As I said in the statement: a competitive taxation regime, a competitive transport system and a competitive education sector are all relevant to the performance of manufacturing. The other issues which are relevant to the performance of manufacturing relate, of course, to the performance of individual firms. Governments cannot legislate for quality, for good management on the factory floor and for productivity on the factory floor. Firms can do those things and many of them have done them and are doing them.

        Although Senator Boswell is not interested in history, some honourable senators opposite might be. Thirty years of their governments never addressed those issues; 30 years of conservative governments never addressed those issues. When industry came to them to ask `Can we have a bit more higher tariff protection?' those opposite doled out to industry after industry made-to-measure tariffs. None of those issues were addressed because they were all masked by the abysmal failure of those opposite in addressing protection issues. Between 1973 and when they were thrown out of office there was not one percentage point change in industry assistance. They did nothing.

       <para>
        Senator Jones has particularly asked about the action which the Australia Government might be taking to protect the community from the activities of the Yakuza criminal gangs from Japan. It is alleged that the gangs can launder money in legitimate business enterprises in order to disguise the origins of those funds in criminal activity in Japan. I must say that I am not aware of any particular threats to Australian investment and business from these Yakuza Japanese criminal gangs. Of course, should we become aware of such activity appropriate steps will be taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly, wherever possible the Australian Federal Police monitors the presence and the activities of Yakuza criminal gangs should they enter Australia. It maintains very close liaison with other law enforcement agencies to achieve this. Of course, appropriate action will be taken should we become aware of the money laundering activities to which I think Senator Jones refers. Indeed, this Parliament has passed the most stringent laws relating to money laundering, including creating offences of bringing money into the country for the purposes of laundering and disguising the criminal origins of that money. In fact, the Parliament has passed laws which impose a fine up to $200,000 and a gaol term of up to 20 years for those people who bring money into the country for that purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am quite sure that we would take every step possible to monitor the activity of members of the Yakuza criminal gangs should they enter the honourable senator's home State or any other part of Australia. We are concerned to prevent money laundering, not only because it disguises the profits of crime which, of course, we would confiscate if they were identified but also it can undermine legitimate law abiding business and commercial activity.

         —The Senate will be aware that the Government has been concerned to see superannuation extended to low and middle income groups which previously have had poor access to such schemes. By far the most important means of accelerating the spread of superannuation to date has been award based superannuation. The Government's submission to this year's national wage case proposed that the new wage fixing arrangements should provide a further round of 3 per cent award based superannuation to be phased in over several years.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        About 80 per cent of Australian workers are covered by awards and, of those, about 80 per cent to 85 per cent have a superannuation entitlement provision inserted in them. This represents a total of about 65 per cent of employees in Australia. I have seen the report of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) suggesting that 40 per cent of employers have not paid the contributions required of them in the awards. A preliminary estimate by my Department indicates that this figure may be accurate. If this is the case, a significant number of companies, large and small, are, in fact, breaking the law and up to $700m in superannuation entitlements is currently being withheld from workers in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our evidence suggests that some companies are deliberately refusing to pay their workers superannuation. That is a serious state of affairs. We know that some companies are putting money aside, but not into superannuation funds. Some have raised ideological objections; some are ignorant; and some plead that in their circumstances there is not a capacity to pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        The need to improve compliance with superannuation award provisions is recognised and the Government is acting accordingly. A national strategy involving education and enforcement activities has been developed in consultation with the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry. As honourable senators would know, the Industrial Relations Act 1988 has been amended recently to clarify and strengthen the provisions dealing with the enforcement of award based superannuation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Results to date indicate the strategy's success in substantially raising compliance levels; for example, drives to improve compliance in the textile, clothing and footwear industries have resulted in compliance levels near 90 per cent. Similarly, compliance levels in the vehicle retail, service and repair sector and the furnishing and insurance industries have improved significantly. As to the hospitality industry awards, officers have contacted over 2,000 employers and have advised them of their obligations. My advice to employers is that they comply, and comply immediately. It is an entitlement of their workers at law and, by not paying, they are breaking the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make these two concluding observations. I point out that a recent comment on superannuation was made by the superannuation services manager of KPMG Peat Marwick: for award employees, the industry funds provide one of the best, if not the best, alternatives for superannuation. I also say that there is an obligation on unions to enforce their awards. I have now directed officers of my Department-using the powers of prosecution and ultimately fining, if that prosecution results in a conviction-to pursue provisions to enforce the payment of superannuation and shift some of that $700m that must be out there to where it belongs-into the pockets of employees.

Will Australia be contributing to the GEF and, if so, how much?

         —I am aware of the report on this morning's Australian Broadcasting Corporation program that Australia is yet to commit itself to the contribution to the global environmental facility, or GEF as it is called. Australian participation in the GEF is still under active consideration by the Government. Of course, a number of portfolios are involved; but I would expect a decision to be made shortly.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The GEF was launched just at the end of last year, in November, as a three-year pilot scheme to provide funding to allow developing countries to incorporate environmental concerns in their development programs. Eastern European countries are also eligible. A number of developed and, as we understand it, developing countries have contributed to the scheme, although I cannot confirm right now that more than 20 have done so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has recognised the need for funding of the kind the GEF has been designed to meet, and we are certainly sympathetic to its aims. However, the point needs to be emphasised that the GEF is only one of a number of schemes for funding environmental programs that are currently littering the landscape. Demands for funds to tackle global environmental problems are growing and will unquestionably continue to grow. Australia will contribute its fair share to these global efforts. However, we may not be able to contribute to all the schemes that have been developed or are in the pipeline. We have a duty, especially in our current economic circumstances, to ensure that our funds and expenditure in this respect achieve maximum environmental benefit and effectiveness.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to emphasis that, quite apart from contributing in a policy sense to global environmental issues such as Antarctica, we have been putting our money where our mouth is in a number of quite specific programs. For example, in 1989 the Prime Minister announced a $20m four-year environmental development assistance program focused on our own region. We have already committed $6m to the Montreal protocol fund to protect the ozone layer; over $2m to environmental programs in the South Pacific, including $300,000 to the South Pacific regional environmental program, or SPREP; and $6.25m over three years to a project to install sea level monitoring stations in the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last year we approved expenditure of an additional $5.2m to support international development cooperation on environmental global issues, which will be spent on activities such as population stabilisation, the protection of tropical forests, climate change and, again, the protection of the ozone layer. We are also contributing, as Senator Cook and others have made clear from time to time, to the International Tropical Timber Organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think it is fair to suggest that Australia has in any way resiled from its commitment to play a leading role in international efforts to find solutions to global environmental problems both in a policy sense and in a financial sense.

Advanced manufacturing technology relates to equipment which is generally computer controlled or microprocessor based, and it is used in the design, production, testing or handling of a product. For example, robotics, advanced machine tools, computer-aided design facilities and automated handling materials all fall into the category of advanced manufacturing technology. Advanced manufacturing technology has to go hand in hand with changes in the labour market in terms of multiskilling and increased skills. Just-in-time, total quality management and those sorts of things go hand in hand with the use of advanced manufacturing technology.

        The take-up of advanced manufacturing technology in Australia has proceeded quite significantly in recent years, but it should be much higher.

These have benefited from things such as the bounty on machine tools and robots. The sector has gone through a period of rationalisation, and we now have some very good firms such as Laser Lab in Melbourne, Anchor in Melbourne, Kirby Engineering-Victoria, Farley Manufacturing and so on.

         —The statement indicates that the Government has altered the assistance arrangements for the sugar industry. That is consistent with the thrust of the whole statement. The point is that tariffs on agricultural products have exactly the same impact as tariffs on manufactured goods. While they provide some assistance to the protected industry, the higher prices caused by a tariff become an impost on consumers or businesses which buy those products.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The high rate of tariff on sugar was a classic example of this problem. The current tariff rate of $115 a tonne translates to over 35 per cent tariff. Consequently, sugar tariffs are being phased down ahead of the Government's consideration of post-1992 assistance arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also believes that it is appropriate for assistance to the sugar industry to be brought back on track with the spirit of the 1988 decision. That decision, made in 1988, was altered following National Party inspired amendments-one might even say Senator Boswell inspired amendments-to the original legislation in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Party does not realise that the sugar tariff phase-down is quite consistent with the tariff reductions, for example, on textile, clothing and footwear and motor vehicles-moves that are applauded by the farm sector which the honourable senator once used to represent. If these tariff cuts are, to use Senator O'Chee's words, `kicking the industry while it is down', I await with interest the development of a consistent line on tariffs from Senator O'Chee and, indeed, from the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator O'Chee paints a nightmare scenario which will just not come about because by maintaining a specific tariff rate on sugar, the industry can be assured that it will remain protected in times of low world prices. At current world prices and exchange rate the new specific rates will equate to an ad valorem equivalent of 28 per cent in 1991 and 21 per cent in 1992. I am sure members of the National Party would be complaining very vigorously if there were tariff rates at that level on farm machinery or fertilisers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe I am misjudging members of the National Party; maybe they would not be complaining very vigorously-but they ought to be if they are representing the constituency they claim to represent. The cuts announced in the statement are very important to the food processing sector of Australian industry, which has to be given a fair go on international markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me just give the Senate some examples-and this is not history so Senator Boswell might be interested-of high protection for the sugar industry and the costs to the other industries in Australia. The current sugar pricing arrangements in Australia cost the food processing industry about $90m a year. The faster phasing arrangements should ensure further growth in this vital industry.

        <para in-line="1">
         —I am aware of criticism expressed by the Public Sector Union (PSU) about my Department's equal employment opportunity record. The PSU and the Professional Officers Association (POA) on 27 February put out a joint statement critical of the Department's record. The union's criticism centred on two unrelated issues: restructuring in the management and information library area, which the unions believed had EEO implications, and the most recent promotion round to 11 Senior Executive Service (SES) band one positions in the Department.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to the first one, the dispute over the library was heard in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 5 March. The matter was resolved by agreement of the parties on the basis of a proposal put forward by my Department. Despite all the fulminations before the event, EEO was not even raised by the POA as an issue at the hearing, nor should it have been because the proposed restructuring in no way contravened either the spirit or the letter of the Government's policy on EEO. I note again that the Public Sector Union appeared at the hearing on 5 March in support of the POA and its representative said nothing in that respect either.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the latest SES promotion round, it is correct that none of those promoted were women. There is, however, a simple reason for this: the selection advisory committee, which included a senior female officer representing the Public Service Commission, came up with an order of merit which did not include any women among the top 11 applicants. The promotions were the result of a merit based, competitive process, as the law requires. Of the 163 applicants only 14 or about 8 1/2 per cent were in fact women. Less than 7 per cent of all applicants were promoted, and I think the process should be understood in that light.
       </para>
       <para>
        More generally, I do accept that compared with the Public Service average, my Department has fewer women at middle and senior levels. It is by no means the worst offender or the only offender in this respect because the relatively low number of women at senior levels is common across most departments. To some extent this imbalance in the representation of women at the senior levels is the result of time lags in past recruitment practices. The Department has relatively few women in the SES and its feeder groups because its recruitment until the late 1970s was really quite unbalanced in gender terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is another reason unique to my Department for the gender imbalance, and I refer to the added burden which overseas service does place on female officers balancing career and other aspirations. It is an unfortunate, but I think undeniable, sociological fact, that it does remain harder for married women than for married men to take overseas postings-certainly they perceive it in those terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department, with my full support, is working hard to find ways to eliminate or compensate for these factors. This includes efforts through the overseas allowance system to compensate for the loss of a second income and includes efforts to reach reciprocal arrangements on the employment of spouses overseas and also removing obstacles to the employment of spouses as locally engaged staff in our overseas posts.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also the case that recruitment practices have significantly changed. The graduate intake has had approximately equal numbers for the last several years. This year's intake, Senator Reynolds will be delighted to learn, had 17 females and only 10 males. The number of women in the SES feeder group-the senior officer grade B level-is also growing. Eight of the 20 most recent promotees to this level were females. This represented 40 per cent of promotees from a field in which female applicants were only 16 per cent. Female officers are well represented in the Department's training courses, which are of course crucial to career development. The gender balance in these programs is approximately equal.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, the world of Australian diplomacy-whatever it may have been in the past-is becoming less of a man's club, although obviously not as fast as my Department or I would like. The Department is committed to working with the PSU and other staff associations on EEO issues and a joint union-management working group has already been established to look urgently at further means of improving implementation of that program.

Four million dollars of it-and this is terrible!-was for television and print campaigns on family allowance supplement and family allowance. The amount of $350,000 was for a launch of financial information service for pensioners brochures so that we can get financial information out to pensioners. Another $1m was for the launch of the jobs, education and training program. Another $1.5m was for a superannuation campaign-television and print advertisements. Another $600,000 was for the upgrading of multilingual telephone information services. Most of the items that I have just mentioned are used by the Department for promotional purposes.

Further, is the whole $11m a year spent on promotion the best use of scarce welfare dollars, which could rather be paid directly to needy people in our community, whose numbers are increasing dramatically as a result of the recession which, in this Government's terms, `we had to have'?

The very idea that there is something wrong with the Department of Social Security actually spreading its message I find extraordinary.

I intend to make sure the message gets out to people right around Australia about the whole range of social security services that are available to them-particularly in a recession.

         —The Gulf war and the massive arms build-up by Iraq in the years that preceded it do, of course, dramatically underline the need to reinvigorate international efforts to prevent nuclear, chemical, biological and missile proliferation and also to address the unrestricted sales of conventional arms. The scale of that build-up is, I think, amply appreciated by honourable senators but one recent statistic that makes it even clearer is that before the recent war, Iraqi military expenditure amounted to more than 27 per cent of its gross national product compared with 2.5 per cent for Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Australia does have a capacity and an international standing on arms control issues to play a helpful role in this respect. In consultation with other governments, we are actively pursuing a coordinated plan of action.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the first place, there is an urgent need for measures to strengthen the existing export control regimes on items related to nuclear, chemical, biological and missile proliferation. We are working right now, in the nuclear suppliers group, the Australia group on chemical and biological weapons and the missile technology control regime to achieve that. We recognise, however, that the only feasible, long term answer to the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is through global multilateral agreements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, secondly, we will work to revitalise and impart a new sense of urgency to the negotiations in Geneva on the question of a comprehensive chemical weapons convention. To this end, I have been in contact in recent days with other relevant foreign Ministers, suggesting a particular strategy for achieving just that. Thirdly, we are encouraging the countries of the Middle East to themselves reach their own regional measures, drawing some experience in this respect from our own efforts with the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone and with the regional chemical weapons initiative initiated by the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the international community has yet to come to grips with the proliferation of massive amounts of offensive conventional weaponry. Australia again is a quite active participant in the growing exchanges between countries on this particular problem. The United Nations (UN) expert group on conventional arms transfers has been focusing on increasing the transparency of conventional arms transfers. Australia is a participant in that expert group and we are looking forward to the finalisation of its recommendations and their early implementation, especially on the question-as I have said in this chamber-of a UN register of arms transfers.
       </para>
       <para>
        To conclude, it should also perhaps be said that the most enduring and satisfactory outcome for the Middle East would be the achievement of a political settlement, which would at least reduce the incentive to purchase arms and would hopefully include a regional agreement capping force levels. We strongly support efforts towards this end by countries of the region assisted by the United States and other key parties to the coalition.

I ask the Minister: what plans have been made by the Federal Government to recognise this significant event? Could these plans include a visit of selected members of the 9th Division to the battleground as a means of paying respect to the many Australians who lost their lives during this battle, which many believe marked the beginning of the defeat of Germany? I add that a visit of this nature by Australian returned service personnel could only add to the efforts of peace in the area.

Does the Minister agree with me that this action should not be excluded from examination as to its legitimacy or efficiency? Why was the action taken? Whilst the rules of war permit the engagement of retreating fully armed forces who refuse to surrender, was there not considerable evidence that these Iraqi forces were confused about how to surrender? In this instance did the coalition forces ensure, by leaflet drops or otherwise, that the Iraqis evacuating Kuwait along that road were invited to surrender? In view of the fact of the supremacy of the coalition forces at the time and the fact that the northern end of the road was blocked off by coalition forces, could the bombing of the convoy be regarded as nugatory from a military standpoint?

My understanding is that constantly from 15 January onwards the whole of the war sector was leafleted with instructions in Arabic and drawings as to how people could best surrender. General Schwarzkopf also made absolutely clear at the start of the land offensive the conditions under which allied forces would not attack. That was simply that opposing forces would surrender their small arms, not be in a military group and make it absolutely certain by signalling with their hands up that they were surrendering.

         —On Monday Senator Macdonald asked me a question about a press report on Townsville Airport. I have obtained the following information. The Department of Defence has no present operational requirement to extend the runway at Townsville; nor is it considering any contribution to the present runway extension proposal. This matter has been thoroughly investigated in the past and Defence's position has been clearly enunciated in responses made by previous Defence Ministers, by local Government representatives and other members of Parliament. However, Defence is in the process of buying land at the end of the runway at a total cost of $26,000 to enable the runway to be extended in the future should such a requirement either for Defence or civil aviation needs arise.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This is the maximum contribution that Defence is to make at this time. A longer runway at Townsville will permit heavily laden military aircraft to operate from the runway at the increased margins of safety. I stress again that there is no current operational requirement for Townsville to have an extended runway. It is not cost effective to do so for present military purposes. In accordance with the agreed interdepartmental arrangements, any civil aviation need to extend the runway would be the responsibility of the Federal Aviation Authority. I understand that the support of the airlines would be required for any such proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        On a separate but related issue, the Federal Airports Corporation has written to my Department proposing the relocation of concrete barrier plinths which notionally reduce the operational length of the existing runway by 200 metres. The original RAAF arrester barriers on the runway were net barriers mounted on concrete plinths, about one metre high at the runway ends. With the installation of new hook cable barriers across the runway, the net barrier has been taken down. The Air Force retained the plinths so that the net barrier could be recommissioned for specific military operations. However, the Air Force is currently re-examining its requirement and the possibility of repositioning the plinths in the runway overrun.

        —This was to be an industry policy statement dealing with the Government's industry plans in relation to the car industry and like matters. But it was hijacked by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as an assertion of his leadership after the Press Club fall-out with Mr Keating and, more recently, as a political response to the disastrous Government-driven recession.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In classical Hawkespeak, it is yet another call to join together to meet a challenge-all the jargon of the past. He calls for the understanding and commitment of all Australians, as he puts it, as individuals and through their respective organisations, to act: the culture of a discredited accord; the language of a summit; all excuses for good leadership and direction. What was supposed to be an important industry statement-and that section of it which does actually relate to industry reform, in part, we support-was reduced sadly to a political stunt. It was quite understandable that Senator Button, refusing to be part of the charade, declined to read the Prime Minister's speech.
      </para>
      <para>
       The package is titled Building a Competitive Australia, but fails to address major obstacles to achieving that goal, obstacles within the province of Government. There is no doubt that Australian business should be more outward looking, more aggressive and more adventurous, but it is so easy to knock our exporters without addressing the Government-imposed or Government-sanctioned burdens which limit their capacity to compete.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister seems finally to appreciate that we exist within a very competitive world, but fails to appreciate that we cannot expect our business to compete unless it is given a reasonable opportunity to do so. This is the major failing of this package. The Prime Minister claimed to look beyond the question of industry reform at the wider question of improving the productive capacity of the economy, an economy which he said needed to be more internationally competitive, but he failed to address the principal responsibilities of government.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the macro sense business must operate within the government-determined economic settings, yet this Government adopted interest rate policies which crush domestic business, interest rates that are still in real terms at prohibitive levels. In the micro sense this Government has failed adequately to address the inefficient waterfront; prohibitive transport costs; stifling regulations; inflexible industrial relations structures; inefficient statutory corporations; big, expensive government; and a tax structure which destroys incentive.
      </para>
      <para>
       These are the domestic issues that the Government must address if it is to give Australian business a fair chance at being internationally competitive. These are the major issues which are all but avoided in this statement. Rather than calling on Australians to be more competitive, the Government should have set down a much-accelerated program of reform of these inhibiting factors which are within its control. Its failure to do so demonstrates the shallowness of the package as a program of reform and accentuates its form as yet another political sham.
      </para>
      <para>
       Madam Acting Deputy President, one should have guessed what was coming from the history of the document, and I invite you to recall the setting. After eight years of the Hawke-Keating Government, it had driven Australia into arguably the worst recession since World War II. It was desperate to hang on to power but incredibly uncertain as to its direction. Australian production had become so uncompetitive within the Government's economic parameters that foreign debt had quadrupled to over $164 billion, and every month the balance of payments was worsening by about $1.5 billion. The level of enlightenment of Mr Keating, the Treasurer, the architect of this economic disaster, was his assessment that the figures had moved from being beautiful to not bad.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Government's economic partner in this disaster, was pressing its 10-point package for selective intervention with an increase in government spending of $227m. The Australian Labor Party's National Secretary, Mr Hogg, was pressing for a more interventionist policy in similar terms. The Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) were quarrelling over who would have responsibility for assistance levels in the automotive industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       At this time, Senator Button's Cabinet submissions were leaked. What were they? Tariff reductions and some specific assistance programs. To commentators his reported approach sounded very much like shifting the deckchairs on the Titanic. After all his time as Minister, for all the `good' years and his access to the highest echelons of industry and Australia's greatest thinkers, he could not shift beyond the myopic focus of industry policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was then Hawke the politician who became nervous. His reaction was to invite Ministers to give their separate views on policy direction, so Cabinet kites were set flying in all directions. Button, Kerin, Keating and Dawkins all supported Government intervention to allow, in the words of Senator Button, `some benefit in selective correction of market failure in the manufacturing sector'. By November it was rumoured that the stage management of the statement would move from Button to Hawke. Senator Bolkus called for enlightened economic rationalism. In fact, the call for strategic intervention stormed in from the Left Ministers, Howe and Bolkus in particular. Keating called them the `new interventionists'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Then Mr Crean got into the act of advocating sectoral policies. Mr Keating referred to this as the new McEwenism. The Left, as naive as ever, tried to draw a linkage between domestic reforms and reform in world trade-a sort of indexed reform of industry policy on a world scale. Mr Keating attacked the Crean proposal likening it to another Victorian Economic Development Corporation push.
      </para>
      <para>
       By now, the resource protection issue was public. Mr Hawke in Tasmania said that it was not necessary; at the same time, Mr Griffiths was circulating a paper calling for it. As is not unusual, Mr Hawke back-pedalled. The real message in this sad sequence of events is that it evidences a shambles in government, confusion and uncertainty and a total lack of leadership at a time when Australia desperately needed real leadership. A master speech writer was then brought in to attempt to craft this mess into something saleable.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is the behaviour of a government which no longer deserves to govern, which has lost confidence in itself and, therefore, cannot expect the confidence of others. This failure of confidence comes through the document. It should be blatantly obvious that to maintain standards of living in this country we need to be internationally competitive. That does not mean that we need to be more competitive than we were last year. We do not compete with ourselves; it is the international marketplace within which we must compete, and against which we must be tested.
      </para>
      <para>
       So much material has been put before the Government of recent times to demonstrate the extent of failure in this regard. A lot of it has been collated for the recent conference of the Business Council of Australia `Developing Australia's Competitiveness'. Which unimaginative government sought to piggyback on this theme? It was the same business group which a year ago warned the Government of the threat to Australia of a prolonged build-up of debt-a message which was not heard as the position has further deteriorated in the meantime. On page 10 of its background paper, the Business Council said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Our competitiveness provides the critical foundation for wealth creation and determines the ability of Australia to grow faster or slower than the rest of the world. Developing a strong base of internationally competitive businesses is therefore vital to the long term success of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is clearly correct. The Business Council reminds us that the answer is not just in industry reform. If most Australian firms are to be successful, then the economy as a whole has to be improved. If we look at manufacturing examples alone, it is estimated that industry controls only about one-third of its total costs-the balance is beyond its capacity. That is why interest rates, high inflation and exchange rates are also vitally important; that is why transport infrastructure, the waterfront, the taxation regime and all of those micro-economic areas are vital. It is, in fact, why the Government's total economic package and its economic performance are so critical. It, again, demonstrates why this package fails.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Business Council looked at Australia's competitiveness, and it is not a happy picture. For example, the Government should be aware that Australia rates poorly on a wide range of labour market measures-with high rates of absenteeism, high labour turnover, low willingness to accept new technology and a poor ability to adjust remuneration to economic circumstances and limited automation-because each day Senator Cook boasts about the claimed achievements of this industrial relations system which has let us down so badly. It should also be aware that regulations hampering business are also rated poorly by international comparison.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us look at other areas within the province of government. Studies by Professor Henry Ergas, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and Brian Haig suggest that Australia's utilities have labour capital productivity at levels at best 50 per cent of that overseas. This is, of course, an enormous extra cost for Australian business. Even in power production where we have great natural advantages, we are slipping.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1987 we were the second lowest cost power producer among 12 major countries but by 1989 we had fallen to sixth. In coastal shipping the Industries Assistance Commission estimated that foreign flag ships were 20 to 50 per cent cheaper than Australian flag ships. In rail transport the Industry Commission in its 1989-90 annual report estimated that 30.5 per cent overall cost reductions were possible from achieving international standard work practices.
      </para>
      <para>
       The result of all this is that, whilst productivity levels in Australian agriculture and mining are high by world standards, in manufacturing we are 20 to 25 per cent below international best performances and in the private service sector often 10 per cent below the average international levels. When the Business Council compared productivity in around 15 manufacturing locations in Australia to the best performed in similar plants overseas, it concluded that productivity could be raised 25 per cent in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Button would be aware of the Industry Commission draft report on the automotive industry which showed that labour productivity in Australia was less than half that in Japan and two-thirds of that in the United States. In cement, despite paying wages that were 75 per cent of US levels, low productivity meant Australian unit labour costs were 75 per cent higher than US levels, and so one can go on. What these dismal figures demonstrate is how far Australia has fallen behind and how desperate is the need for radical and fundamental reform; not the sort of tinkering around the edges contained in much of the statement we are debating today.
      </para>
      <para>
       What is particularly disturbing is that for a long time our productivity growth has been slower than overseas, but since this Government has been in office the rate at which we are slipping further behind has in fact accelerated. This, one suspects, is because of the additional burden placed on business by the Government's failure to get its economic policies right. As is validly said in the Business Council background paper to which I have been referring:
      </para>
      <para>
       In the end companies themselves will succeed or fail in international competition, but the competitive environment in which they operate is influenced by institutions, infrastructure and Government policies. The most important factors are not specific industry assistance, but those factors shaping the supply of quality of human resources and other basic infrastructure and institutions across the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is where the Government has failed business in this statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the issue of comparative competitiveness, let me conclude with Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and remind the Senate of the Bureau of Industry Economics research paper No. 34 which showed poor labour, capital and total unit cost performances for the Australian plant compared with Kodak's plants in Brazil, Canada and the United Kingdom (UK). Labour productivity per hour, in fact, was around 10 to 20 per cent lower than Brazil or Canada. Costs were higher partly due to the higher proportion of paid hours not involving production. Unit capital costs were almost double that of the United Kingdom and two-thirds higher than Canada. This company's inefficient work practices were recently rewarded by a payment by this Government of some $36m of taxpayers' money.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the statement had announced commencement of the third runway in Sydney, mining at Coronation Hill, the scrapping of the illogical and irrational three mine uranium policy-which was raised during the discussion period leading up to this paper but then returned to the too-hard basket-or the reform of trans-Tasman shipping, or a goods and services tax which would have allowed the abolition of all the wholesale sales taxes, then the Government could have said that it was showing a lead. But as the public debacle of the months leading up to the statement demonstrated, the Government has neither the vision nor the courage to tackle the big issues.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ICI experience being now so often quoted demonstrates how an efficient industry cannot overcome the competition gap unless government meets its share of the responsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude by stressing the close relationship between the domestic reform agenda and the need to make Australia internationally competitive. Garnaut in his report said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's poor productivity growth is closely related to its parochial economic orientation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Later:
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's largest problem is that our isolation has been greatly compounded by exceptionally high costs at and inside our borders.
      </para>
      <para>
       What is the result in international terms? Garnaut reminds us that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Foreign trade accounts for much less of our production than in other advanced countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       So it was a damning indictment that, when McKinsey looked recently at Austrade, the Government's principal promotion body, he found on the part of government:
      </para>
      <para>
       an absence of a clear strategy that encourages development of exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       This, of course, was denied by Senator Button. But in this statement we note that Austrade has been taken out of his hands and passed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Could there be any clearer acknowledgment of failure?
      </para>
      <para>
       So the Government has let Australia down in the obstacles it has placed in the way of building competitive domestic industry, and it has let Australia down in not appreciating the linkage between domestic efficiency and international competitiveness.
      </para>
      <para>
       This statement is to be condemned for what it has failed to do. The necessary reforms, which I have mentioned and which my colleagues will expand upon in speeches that are to follow, will not be achieved through this Government. This much we have now learned. But they will be achieved through the first Hewson government and only then will Australian industry be given a fair opportunity to be truly internationally competitive.

He seems to find that objectionable. If Senator Panizza and, through him, the Opposition want to criticise those Australians who have stood behind the plough, worked in factories, made cars, driven trams, conducted small businesses and taught in schools, then so be it. However, there is a big difference between the Opposition and the Government, and that is what Parliament is all about. The Government has a lot of respect for the ordinary men and women who go about their daily labours and do not enjoy the privileges that people like Senator Panizza and myself enjoy here. Those ordinary Australians have a fairly hard struggle. I simply say to Senator Patterson, who is trying to interject, that I do not-and I am sure that senators on this side of the chamber do not-object to giving to those people $36m in tax relief.

       It is a popular view in this country that industrial disputes are widespread at Australian workplaces. There has been excellent work done recently by four young people in the Commonwealth Department of Industrial Relations who deserve great praise: Ron Callus, Alison Morehead, Mark Cully and John Buchanan. They have done great research in this area. What have they found? They have put on one side the popular view that people take and they have put the reality on the other side.
      </para>
      <para>
       Their research shows that the popular view, as I said, is that industrial disputes are widespread at Australian workplaces. The fact is that 72 per cent of workplaces have never had an industrial action, according to their research. The next popular myth is that most Australian workplaces are unionised. The reality is that 57 per cent of workplaces have no union members. The next popular myth is that most unionised workplaces have many unions. Fact: only 2 per cent of workplaces have five or more unions. Popular myth: unions are quite active at workplaces in Australia. Fact: at most workplaces delegates spend one hour or less on union work; and there are no delegates at all at 34 per cent of unionised workplaces. Popular myth: very little changes at Australian workplaces. Fact: 86 per cent of workplaces had undergone some major organisational changes in the last two years.

       Myth: industrial relations is seen by management as the major efficiency barrier. Reality: managers see financial and capital constraints as the major barriers. We are going to hear from a long list of very eloquent speakers from the other side of the chamber and from this side as well. I would be disappointed if I did not see Senator Watson's name on the list, and I am glad to see that he follows me. I am disappointed that Senator Crichton-Browne is not here. I think, with his ability in this area, he should put himself on the list.

        —That is good. I will be hearing the honourable senator. It will be interesting to hear and to see on the television screens in our rooms whether he is able to take the generous view of the issues that we do this side or whether he says, `Look, this is dreadful. The workers are not working properly; the unions are absolutely dreadful. This Government is hopeless and the Opposition is great; business is great, and all we need to do is change the Government'. That is going to the scapegoating process.

       Senator Patterson, with her background in psychology, would be the person to consult as to why her leader, Senator Hill, when talking of eminent people on this side, did not give them their titles but talked of Keating, Crean, Hawke, Dawkins and so on. I ask Senator Patterson whether that is consistent with this process of scapegoating that I have talked about or whether it is consistent with something else. If so, what is it consistent with? I ask why, when we are suffering the present quite severe traumas in the economy, those on the other side of the chamber go into scapegoating while on this side we are desperate to cooperate with everybody to see whether Australia can be rescued from its present predicament-and we are confident of that. Are we to have from now on a whole cacophony of finding people to blame, to attach guilt to, so we can drive them out into the desert; or are we, as this statement entitled Building a Competitive Australia so eloquently does, to set out a plan for doing things?
      </para>
      <para>
       I say this about micro-economic reform: Senator Collins is much questioned about this, and he has produced great change on the waterfront. That is evidenced by the fact that all the stevedoring companies, all of which are in private hands, are in various stages of agreements with the waterside workers to produce the reform that is so much sought. National Terminals (Australia) Ltd already has; Conaust Pty Ltd is well down the line, and so is Strang Patrick, the Union Steam Ship Co. and Trans Ocean Terminals. I would ask those on the other side of the chamber, when they are berating the waterside workers-their fellow Australians, people who are suffering the same burdens as the rest of us and who are as interested as anybody in seeing reform carried out-to look at what sort of equipment they have. When honourable senators opposite compare Australia with Singapore, they should ask how many cranes per ship are available in the Singapore wharves. When those opposite are looking at what the waterside workers in Rotterdam do, let them ask what mechanisation is in place there. I do not ask them to withdraw criticism if it is deserved, but they should not, for heaven's sake, make criticism that is not properly directed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think the order of the day is that we keep our remarks to within a particular time frame so that everybody can have a go at this stage. The fundamental difference between this, the Government side of the chamber and the other side is that the Government wants reform, as the Opposition wants reform. The Government wants to see change in Australian attitudes, as does the Opposition. The Government wants to do it in a humane fashion, with people being entitled to be treated as fellow human beings. The Government wants to avoid the exercise of scapegoating and wants to see a truly united Australia. Unfortunately, from the remarks made by Senator Hill, that is not the proposition on the other side. What the Opposition wants is industrial war, where the last unionist or the last manager is left standing and then they fight it out and whoever wins, it is either a victory for labour or a victory for management. That is what is proclaimed on the other side and that will come out as an inference from the speeches members of the Opposition make.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Opposition wants, in addition to loading up the work force with blame, to load up the Government. That is all right and it is a good political tactic, but this is the problem with it all: in blaming the Government, one overlooks the real needs that exist in this country and the real calls for reform which this document, Building a Competitive Australia, addresses. There is danger in the approach the Opposition takes of going back to how things were in the last century, of going back to the stage which led those great judges of the High Court, Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Rich, when dealing with a case called the Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v. Melbourne Corporation to say:

       Those are the Acts dealing with the development of industrial law in England. The judges go on:
      </para>
      <para>
       But the broad fact that emerges is that the position of industrialists, by a singular reversal of what has been thought to be the general current of history, has been gradually changing from one of pure contract to one of status. This, which is the irresistible conclusion from a broad survey of the stream of industrial effort . . . is emphasised by the views of Mr Sidney Webb in a recent work . . . The `industrial revolution' for a long time . . . made the workman's labour a mere marketable commodity to be bought at the lowest price that individual competition between workers would permit.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is exactly what is being proposed here, that the workman's labour should be reduced to a mere marketable commodity to be bought at the lowest price that individual competition between workers will permit.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the honourable senators opposite are talking about this matter, I ask them-if any will address it-whether it is their position that the workman's, or now workwoman's, labour should be treated as a mere marketable commodity to be bought at the lowest price that individual competition between workers will permit. If that is what the Opposition does say it is differing in philosophy to the judges of the High Court because what they say, and I will finish on this, is:
      </para>
      <para>
       The degradation and suffering that ensued, the revolt against the system, the repression of illegal acts, the amelioration of the law, the organisation of labour, the gradual recognition of collective bargaining, the introduction of private conciliation and arbitration as well as of industrial laws securing better conditions for workers, are all well-known historical facts.
      </para>
      <para>
       I ask this question of all honourable senators on the other side of the chamber now, and Senator Crane in particular because he is very eminent in this field: is it the Opposition's proposition-and I will be listening carefully to see whether it is-the workman's labour be reduced to a mere marketable commodity to be bought at the lowest price that individual competition between workers will permit? If that is the situation, the Opposition is taking us right back to ancient times and we will have to have High Court judges in the future making judgments like that to try to cure the ills that will come about. I will be listening carefully because I would hate to see, because of the policies that the Opposition adopts, our going back to the High Court to see whether we can get some sort of order into society. It is this Parliament, and not the High Court, that should bear this responsibility. The High Court, no doubt, was very concerned that it should have to speak on those terms, but there was an occasion for it to do so.

        —The 12 March statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is a minuscule attempt to address the most protracted recession that has gripped this country for the last 50 years. Everybody is asking for leadership to bring about the required structural change, but the Government response in this document has been one of lost opportunity. As with most Government budgetary, economic and other policy statements, the Prime Minister was left with very little that was new in his 12 March statement after a couple of weeks of leakings and pronouncements-another failed strategy. After the Government Budget last August, Paddy McGuinness made the comment:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Budget was the product of a Treasurer and a Government who have run out of ideas and who no longer have the courage of their convictions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The same could be said for this March statement. The only reason we had to have a March statement was that the Government failed to address our economically disastrous situation in August. The unfortunate thing is that, having gone to the trouble of asking a range of Ministers to put forward their ideas for this particular statement and debating certain policy issues across a wide range of portfolios, and the compiling and delivery of this statement, it is not the sort of bold, revolutionary and visionary statement that Australia needs and Australia demands. The Opposition does concede that there have been some steps in the right direction. What we are complaining about is the very limited way in which the Government has picked up a few of the Liberal Party ideas and proposals. We must acknowledge that across the community there has been overwhelming support for change, overwhelming support for Liberal Party ideals and enunciations. The Australian Labor Party is never slow in identifying a good idea. But while a few good seeds have been sown, they are so sparse as not to constitute a viable crop when grown.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have been interested to read so many writers describe this 12 March statement as, `a small step', `a modest step', and only `tinkering' at the changes. Perhaps if we had statements of this kind each month, we might be able to make some real progress within 12 months. The taxation system does have a major impact on firms. The Treasurer states that his objective must be to have the most competitive taxation environment possible. That statement conflicts with the reality of the situation, as taxpayers across Australia attempt to fathom what is really required of them in an environment of self-assessment.
      </para>
      <para>
       If one compares the tax treatment of the environmental impact studies with the treatment of these studies by our Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) competitors one sees that again this Government has not gone far enough. In this statement the Government provides a write-off for initial environmental impact statements over 12 years, or the life of the project, whichever is the shorter. This Government's treatment is far less concessional than that of our OECD partners. Further, while on this subject, I ask the Minister: what is the position in respect of projects that have been abandoned? Is there an immediate write-off?
      </para>
      <para>
       Basically, what is needed is for this Government to show a dramatically different attitude to change business confidence. Firstly there is a need to examine and to put forward a transitional arrangement for corporate tax payments. Surely, this is the most disappointing feature from the point of view of business and the corporate sector. The Government has failed to acknowledge the cash flow problems that will follow from this Government's demand of 85 per cent tax paid within 28 days of the end of the year. A transitional arrangement is necessary, given the state of business.
      </para>
      <para>
       The corporate sector has experienced continual tax changes in terms of new legislation, regulation, court rulings and Commissioner rulings. There needs to be a greater element of certainty. This statement provides a small step in that direction, particularly in relation to depreciation. We welcome that. I remind the Senate that tax simplification is now seen as a priority by this Government. Simplification is an overdue recognition of previously destroyed taxpayers' rights by this Government. It is a pity that this Government has not grasped the nettle, so to speak, and made substantial instead of small-bit-at-a-time changes. Unfortunately, it is not only the corporate sector that is having difficulty coming to terms with the frequency of the tax changes; the tax professionals are in a dilemma.
      </para>
      <para>
       The depreciation changes are welcome but are only a start. The Government should address a number of questions and should respond to them today in this Parliament. Clarifications are certainly needed in the areas of the technical life provisions introduced through this 12 March statement. In particular, I ask whether the Senate can be assured that the legislative provisions will describe the way in which the effective life of the plant acquired on or after 1 July 1991 will be determined to provide a degree of certainty required under self-assessment. The much heralded effective life provisions are really an update of the `special circumstances' that have been in law for a long time. Taxpayers, on application to the Commissioner, under special circumstances, could always get, if they satisfied the Commissioner, a higher than the prescribed write-off where special circumstances existed, and technical life is certainly one of them.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was disappointed that the new depreciation rules, which were explained in a booklet and obtainable from Government bookshops on the afternoon of the March statement, were not made available to honourable senators in this chamber. I was informed of its existence by a businessman, who telephoned me from outside the Parliament with a query. That is not good enough. Surely the law makers of this land, the Parliament, have the first right to see an illustration of the new changes enunciated in this 12 March statement and to hear about them first from within the Parliament rather than from outside. Therefore I make a request of the Minister that in future where such publications are ready and available for public distribution at the time of the Government's announcements a copy be issued to the members of this Parliament, which would also include the House of Representatives.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I give full credit to the provision whereby small items of plant and tools under $300 can be written off for income tax purposes. This is a correct amendment and one which was greatly needed. We thank the Government for that.
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to the widening of exemptions introduced in the wholesale sales tax for business inputs, it is unfortunate that the opportunity to introduce a broad based goods and services tax was not grasped. I am sure that the Government's view that these wholesale tax concessions will undermine the need for a fair and efficient goods and services tax will not succeed. As one writer has put it: along with the United States of America and Switzerland, Australia is part of a tiny minority of countries continuing to resist the overwhelming international trend towards adopting a form of goods and services tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government's minuscule attempt at broadening the sales tax is an attempt to undermine what the Liberal Party of Australia is all about in tax reform. I acknowledge that this type of tax is not the full solution to Australia's economic ills, but it is one of a range of macro and micro measures that must be considered if we are to make an attempt to solve our present problems. It is quite ironic that in the Taxation Summit of 1985 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) then described the tax system as being unfair and complex and as having adverse effects on incentives to work.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1985 Mr Keating strenuously pushed for a 12.5 per cent consumption tax on all goods and services to replace the existing wholesale sales tax. Then he believed that this tax was a matter of urgency. Today we have almost the entire business community calling for a goods and services tax, not as a panacea for the total remedy of Australia's economic plight, but as part of a total reform package to put Australia back on a sound economic footing. Basically, the changes instituted here offer certain concessions to primary and manufacturing industry without greatly reducing the enormous revenue raising capacity of the tax. The wholesale tax system still remains a cumbersome and outmoded tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       The cost to revenue in this statement of these concessions indicates very graphically the limited nature of this concession to business. We have to acknowledge that the total industry sales tax input exceeds billions of dollars. So this $200m is but a small attempt to address a big problem for business. The existing wholesale sales tax is still a narrowly based tax which applies only to selected consumption goods and some intermediate goods. It has a lack of comprehensiveness in coverage. Therefore, the sales tax impacts differently on different commodities. It is only by having a goods and services tax that a fair go for the manufacturing sector and for Australia's international competitiveness will result. This piecemeal approach is not good enough. Classification issues will remain under the current arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       They will continue to confuse and plague the productive sectors of Australia. I think it will be interesting to note how the Australian Taxation Office polices the new changes. Some tax experts express fears that there are a number of uncertainties as to how the tax will be applied and that it will merely add further interpretation problems to an already complex piece of legislation. Questions have been raised as to how the Australian Taxation Office will define the pre-production activities that have been announced. Further, the changes appear to have been confined to goods used by producers or contractors. Wholesalers or retailers of goods appear to derive few or no benefits.
      </para>
      <para>
       A side effect apparently not thought of by the Government is that its new tax rules could result in a delay in short term investment. I have been told that tax advisers are informing corporations to put on hold any new investment plans until the tax changes are enunciated. It is important to note that the tax changes will come into effect only after royal assent is given to the legislation. That may not be until November 1991, or even later. There is obviously no immediate relief. I would like to repeat another question that I have asked in Question Time. I asked the Minister representing the Treasurer:
      </para>
      <para>
       In view of the fact that the wholesale tax concessions will not take effect until several months after 1 July 1991, does the Minister agree that this delay will be a major disincentive for business-
      </para>
      <para>
       in these recessionary concessions-
      </para>
      <para>
       to lift its investment in the next four to eight months and that this delay will worsen the recession and delay improvements in Australia's productive capacity?
      </para>
      <para>
       I posed this question yesterday. I was promised a quick response. The Treasurer has ignored the request of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce for that response. There is no liaison. There is inadequate communication. How can this country succeed with such a divided Cabinet in which Ministers will not communicate adequately, in which questions cannot be passed on properly from the Senate to the House of Representatives and answers send back?
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us look at the luxury car sales tax. At last the Government has finally admitted to the huge blunder it made in relation to the luxury car tax. What a pity that the Government did not think through the full implications of its tax changes before its initial announcement some 12 months ago. At least this change is a sign that there is still some hope that this Government will recognise all its other stupid decisions and that it will have the guts, to use an Australian expression, to admit to its mistakes and make the appropriate changes. The sales of luxury cars actually surged in the period between Mr Keating's announcement in February 1990 and its implementation in May. We advised the Government of the consequences of that tax. It failed to note that warning.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although I welcome some of the initial steps in taxation reform in the Government's industry statement, because of time constraints I have limited my response to the taxation aspects of that statement. I believe they are merely small steps. As I mentioned earlier, a hungry dog will accept any dry bone. The opportunity existed for extensive reform of the taxation system but, for political expediency, this Government has chosen to give only minor concessions shrouded in a veil of rhetoric.

        —The person who said that the function of socialism was to raise suffering to a higher level clearly had the Hawke Government in mind. Having raised the level of suffering in Australia to a peak of pain from which every sector of the community was screaming for relief, the Hawke panacea after 15 Budgets and economic statements in its eight years was Tuesday's industry statement. It was no more and no less than was expected from a Labor government aiming to appear strong, brave and visionary. I deliberately say `aiming to appear' rather than `aiming to be' strong, brave and visionary because by the end of a well crafted speech written by the speech writer to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), it was obvious the country was expected to accept the content at face value as a show of strength, bravery and vision. Sadly, it was much, much less than that. It was, in fact, 1985 revisited.

       In 1985 deregulation of the financial market was not accompanied by deregulation of the labour market. Australia suffers every day from that half reform. This week, the end of protection was decreed. But the micro-economic reform package with which it must go hand in hand was conspicuous by its absence. This week extra sales tax exemptions on business inputs were delivered. But the country was denied the far greater benefits of a consumption tax. This week our small business community, the engine room of the economy, was ignored but for a few trite phrases about its worth. So much for the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall); when Mr Beddall fights, it seems that small business will lose. This week we had, yet again, another half reform package.

      <para>
       As a nation we will again suffer at the hands of a government which takes hard decisions only if they will not estrange it from its union base. This is a government which, by its failures this week, indicated it can never, despite rhetoric to the contrary, risk prescribing the necessary pain relief for Australia, which means labour market and fast-paced micro-economic reform, because, if it did, the Government may sever the Accord and alienate the union movement. Never has it been more vital to take the hard decisions than now.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has sunk deeply in a morass of problems. Apart from the recession which we had to have, we have a severe shortage of venture and development finance. We are the only industrialised country in the world not to have increased its proportion of exports to gross domestic product. Only Spain invests less on research and development than we do. The Economic Planning Advisory Council says our labour productivity is still declining. Only 15 per cent of our manufacturers have total quality control. Our national inefficiency means that we are industrially out of date. Our goods cost too much and they do not match up to the quality of the goods we can buy from overseas. We need to speed up and clue up.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was absolutely correct when he said in his speech that the challenge for the foreseeable future is to produce more than we spend. The challenge was, therefore, to make the decisions and adopt the practices and attitudes which will enable this and succeeding generations to achieve those basic important goals. Where the Prime Minister lost me, and I am sure every economic commentator in Australia, was in espousing this as a new challenge, when it is a very old challenge indeed. It has always been the challenge for every single year of the Hawke Government-all eight of them. Therefore it is not new, no matter what great prose the Prime Minister's speech writer, Graham Freudenberg, can wrap it in. It is an unfulfilled challenge, one which the Hawke Government has not been able to meet. That ought not to be forgotten in any analysis of the industry statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The industry statement was delivered as a belated attempt to chart a course for Australia which should have been steered years ago. The general direction is to be applauded. The division of duties in the effort to get there is not. I happen to believe that most Australian industry will attempt and will be able to rise, albeit often with enormous difficulty, to the challenge presented to it in the form of surviving and competing profitably with greatly reduced tariffs and quotas. Basically, industry has no choice but to do so if Australia is to go forward into the next century with any economic strength in world markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia, and Australians, have expected to be shielded from the harsh realities of international competition with tariffs and quotas for far too long. Even with that protection, we have sunk to an all-time low where manufactured goods make up 70 per cent of our imports yet only 20 per cent of our exports. We are simply not competitive. We have a manufacturing sector which generally is not making an appropriate contribution, although there are companies which, against all the odds, have restructured and captured brilliantly strong markets for their products in America and Japan.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to two South Australian manufacturing companies. They ought to be mentioned because their sheer determination in breaking into the international markets so successfully is an example for other sections of the manufacturing industry in this country. I talk about ROH Industries, which is selling mag wheels to Japan; Mitsubishi, which is exporting components to Japan to be built into Japanese models and motor vehicles; and, of course, Britax, with its production of rear-vision mirrors which are now being exported to the American market to be incorporated in American produced motor cars. They are examples of which Australia can be proud. They are examples which set the pace. They are examples where we need to give encouragement and direction for other sections of manufacturing industry to follow.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the other end of the spectrum, the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) sector is an excellent example of exactly what is wrong with Australia. It has generally made little attempt to restructure, has been happy to accept protection, and has outdated equipment and work practices which have not changed, in some instances, since the Second World War. Its unions have got off with far too much for far too long. There is more to this than meets the eye. After all, the Australian Labor Party has not wanted trouble in the Prime Minister's Victorian seat, where there is a proliferation of TCF factories. It brings back memories of the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd bail-out-another peacekeeping operation for Labor voters in Mr Hawke's electorate. When asked by one of my colleagues the reason for the Kodak decision, one senior Minister replied, `God decreed that Kodak would receive the bail-out; and, what is more, God's country is the Prime Minister's electorate'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Just as the TCF sector must recognise that we have moved on, Australians, after many decades of refusing to accept the inevitable, must face up to the fact that in areas where we discover that we cannot be internationally competitive we should not waste the time and effort of manufacturing locally. That means some adjustment. We also have to accept that, until our position in the free trade arena settles down, the foreign debt scales may tip more widely than we would like them to. Yet despite the moves in that direction by the industry statement, Australia has frustratingly been delivered only half-policies, which is not only a letdown to all those naive enough to have expected bravery in the face of crisis, but also an admission of cowardice which will go down in history as another Hawke failure.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister made much of the word `together'-I emphasise that word-throughout his speech. The philosophical dictionary that he uses seems very different from mine. In the Prime Minister's dictionary, `together' obviously equals not `we' but only `you'. In his speech there is no `together' which embraces the unions and what they must deliver if Australia is again to have a respected and competitive manufacturing sector by international standards. The speech was aimed at `you'-the business community; `you'-the manufacturing sector; `you'-the rural sector; and `you'-the exporters. There was no `together' with a changed transport industry to help `you' succeed; no `together' with a changed waterfront to save `you' money; no `together' with a program of privatisation; no `together' with changed fiscal policies. No, the weight of and responsibility for the package was thrown one way, and one way only.
      </para>
      <para>
       The industry statement's direction presents an unfair challenge to those in our manufacturing sector who have shown willingness to restructure by not providing them the strength needed to succeed in what lies before them. Yet surely it cannot be lost on the Prime Minister that he is asking those in that sector to face the battle of the 1990s with one hand tied behind their backs. Where is labour deregulation? Only a change of government can deliver that. Where is the fast pace micro-economic reform? Only a change of government will deliver that. The changes expected from manufacturing industry over the next decade, because of the announced demise of protection, are acute.
      </para>
      <para>
       That being the case, it is a reasonable expectation that the Hawke Government should lead by example, tackling the States to accelerate micro-economic reform and tackling the unions to put enterprise bargaining to work. Without changes to the labour market rules and reforms which embrace our decayed and inefficient transport system and our intransigent waterfront, we will not get the required result. Our manufacturing sector-for example, our motor vehicle industry and the component manufacturers to the motor vehicle industry-will continue to be handicapped in its efforts to restructure and perform competitively.
      </para>
      <para>
       The car industry, as I mentioned, is an excellent example. It has shown willingness to restructure, to accept change, and to accept challenge. Faced with tariffs to be halved by the end of the decade, it has indicated that it believes it can deal with the rate of tariff reduction, but only in perspective and only as part of a far greater reform package. It is not asking for anything. That is unfair. It has simply stated that it wants both arms free to operate. The Government must provide it with reduced interest rates, deliver industrial relations reform, lower transportation charges and ensure a more efficient waterfront. If it is not delivered, who do we blame when, halfway through the decade-referred to by Senator Button as the decade of investment worldwide-our car manufacturers withdraw any further capital investment in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country? Who do we blame for the impact that that would have on the component industry within this country?
      </para>
      <para>
       If manufacturing is expected to shape up in the face of the end of protectionism, why are the inefficient service industries which supply it allowed to be left dragging behind? To achieve success, we must cut the overheads and costs of operating so that industry has the leeway to absorb the changed protection circumstances without damage. That is not asking for a hand-out, only for what is due, which so far the unions will not allow to be delivered. If the resistance to micro-economic and labour reform continues, Australia will remain in trouble. Where we are calling on manufacturing industry to meet the challenge, it will not be able to.
      </para>
      <para>
       We must face the fact that lowering the protection barriers alone, without delivering the reform tools to balance the scales, can never provide us with the scope to increase efficiency and productivity to compete with trading partners such as Japan and Germany. While we may be changing, our rate of change will not keep up. Free of the British disease which has Australia still so much in its grip, these countries will be changing ever faster and the end result of that is that we in Australia remain behind: one step forward, two steps back.
      </para>
      <para>
       The waterfront and the trans-Tasman shipping costs are probably the most effective examples of all that is ill with our country-ignored by the industry statement this week, yet crucial to the future of the car industry and every other export industry. It is a damning indictment of the snail's pace of labour reform to have South Australian car manufacturers considering moving stock out of Australia by air transport rather than face the wharf delays and trans-Tasman costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I raised in the Estimates committees last session, the Tasman is the most expensive stretch of water in the world, courtesy of the Australian unions and their agreement. It is cheaper to ship to Europe than to Auckland, and it takes longer to have a truck of export materials processed through the Melbourne docks than it does to drive it from Adelaide to Melbourne. The status of the Australian waterfront as the bastion of all industrial evil displays to our trading partners that Australia remains affected by what I described earlier as that British disease-the disease of obstinate and bloody-minded union dominance over good sense and any commitment to real reform and progress for the sake of the country.
      </para>
      <para>
       As we move to a post-protection era it would not be too cynical to say that only our wrapping has changed. The hard centre of union control and slow reform remains in place to shackle us. If we do not escape the chains we will never again take our rightful place as a major nation. There is too much at stake for a government which claims to really care about the future to have delivered such a half-hearted agenda for the future. This week's industry statement was proof beyond doubt that only a Liberal government can complete the necessary economic equation-the other side of the coin. We have the commitment, we have the strength and we also, incidentally, have the electorate behind us.

        —Two days ago the Hawke Labor Government announced its long awaited industry statement entitled Building a Competitive Australia. I want to look briefly at the criticisms made of the statement by the Opposition and those commentators who came out against it, and then turn to the statement itself and explain why I believe it is an important step in the right direction by the Government and a good policy direction.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I turn first to the statement's critics. It seems to me that the nature of the criticism is very similar to the reaction of young children on their first visit to the royal show. Having worked themselves up into a lather of anticipation before the event, anything, no matter how good, is bound to disappoint their overambitious expectations. That is exactly what has occurred in this case. Despite clear warnings in the media by various Government Ministers of the limited scope of the policy before its unveiling, what the Government had been fearing occurred. Instead of being judged on its merits, the statement has been judged according to some unexplained, and apparently rather difficult to meet, criterion.
      </para>
      <para>
       The statement has been found to be wanting according to this criterion and has, therefore, been condemned by the Opposition and some media commentators as not enough. It has been damned with faint praise. The most popular line in condemnation appears to be that there is nothing wrong with what is in the statement-just what has been left out. Such criticism is rather unfair. It was clear from the beginning that this statement was never intended to be a macro-economic cure-all-some type of patent medicine solution to the problems confronting our economy. Peter Reith, the shadow Treasurer, accused the Government of not addressing the macro-economic problems which are confronting this country. The simple fact is that the implementation of the new macro-economic policies such as a goods and services tax, a re-evaluation of the Budget strategy or any such nonsense was never intended to be part of this statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is not a mini-Budget; it is not a proper Budget. It was never intended to be. The Government does not intend to make any dramatic policy shifts on a macro-economic level and, if it did, this statement is not the format for these alterations to policy. The Government has consistently rejected calls by the Opposition for a mini-Budget, and to judge this industry statement according to the criterion of a mini-Budget is simply silly and unproductive. This Government does have the right macro-economic policy settings in place. If we have failed in any way, it was by relying on our business community to come across with some initiative in pursuing investment opportunities.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have no intention of even considering the question of a goods and services tax. Consumption taxes have been rejected by this Government as a policy option and have been debated ad nauseam in this chamber a number of times. To criticise this statement for not announcing such a tax is a clever political move by the Opposition in allowing it to put across its policies, but it does not really help in analysing the statement. If the shadow Treasurer is really disappointed at this omission, he must have cried an awful lot at the royal show as a child. Perhaps he still does. In any event, if anyone in this place needs reminding about why exactly this Government does not support a consumption tax, I would advise that person to get a copy of the answers that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave in the other place today on that very question.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is one criticism that I wish to deal with at some length. It has been made by the Opposition and such impressive media commentators as the editorial writer for the Australian. It concerns the so-called reform of the labour market. For a definition of reform we can look in the dictionary under `deregulation' for here there exists a significant difference between the Government, the Opposition and, it appears, the leader writer for the Australian. This Government has undertaken, and continues to undertake, the most far reaching, important reforms of any government in the history of this nation. The accord process has provided a rational, sound and successful basis for determining wage outcomes in a fair and equitable manner. It has allowed the Government to exercise an unheard-of degree of control over outcomes, allowing for a predictable and settled labour market and a predictable and settled economic policy. It has also allowed for increases in productivity through successive trade-offs with the union movement, and has markedly decreased the rate of disputes in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       People seem to forget the appalling and destructive practices which occurred in this country before 1983, when industrial disputes often turned into bitter warfare between unions and employers. The accord has led to a radical re-evaluation of the way we operate within our industrial relations system. I do not think too many people on either side of this chamber would disagree with me when I say that we are now a far more mature nation industrially than we have ever been, and much credit for that goes to this Government and, in particular, its successive Ministers for Industrial Relations.
      </para>
      <para>
       In contrast, the Opposition prefers so-called reforms of the labour market, and I use the phrase advisedly. What it means is to take on the unions, break the industrial muscle and force a process of voluntary unionism combined with enterprise bargaining. It all sounds very macho. Greater flexibility is the stated aim. By `greater flexibility' it means more power to the employer in any bargaining situation. When efficiency is the only aim people fall by the wayside. There can be no dispute that, no matter what the rhetoric, what the Opposition wants is to make the unions weaker.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first point to be made in response to this is that it is highly unlikely that any government could succeed in decreasing the power of unions in the way that the Opposition would like to. When the Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems looked at that proposal, it simply rejected it as being outside the scope of industrial reality. In fact, that was the phrase it used-`industrial realities'-being those things that are difficult, if not impossible, to change.
      </para>
      <para>
       This leads to the second point. In even attempting to change the system in such a radical and extremist fashion, the dislocation that would conceivably be caused would be just too great to bear. Do we really want to return to the discredited path of industrial confrontation? It was tried before 1983 and it was a colossal failure.
      </para>
      <para>
       So what would actually be achieved by a coalition government in this area? It would be difficult to proceed with the hidden agenda of destroying the power of unions, as I explained a moment ago. But it would still probably go ahead with the second and more public plank of its labour market reform strategy, which is the destruction of the centralised wage fixing system in favour of enterprise bargaining. No doubt, some unions will be hurt by this, particularly industrially weak unions.
      </para>
      <para>
       But there is an unpleasant side effect for the Opposition; that is, that industrially strong unions freed from the restraints of a centralised system would be able to write their own pay cheques, not because of greater productivity, but because of industrial muscle. Greater inequality would result, and wage outcomes would be determined by industrial muscle; there would be some reform. It is no wonder that major employer organisations supported the current system in submissions to the Hancock Committee, and it is no wonder that such a stupid policy did not get a run on Tuesday. I pray it never gets a run in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn now to the statement itself. Before Peter Reith and certain unnamed leader writers got carried away with what should or should not have been included in the announcement on Tuesday, it all seemed pretty clear. In the Australian Financial Review of 27 February, Michael Stuchbury said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The core of Canberra's March 12 economic statement will be cuts in manufacturing protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       He then outlined some specifics, and went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       If delivered, this would bend a century of failed protectionist economic development strategy in Australia almost to its breaking point.
      </para>
      <para>
       This was delivered: a reduction of tariffs to 5 per cent by 1 July, 1996; a phase-down of tariffs to 15 per cent on passenger vehicles; a termination of global quotas in the textile, clothing and footwear industry; and an across the board reduction in tariffs in that industry. We will be one of the world's most well behaved nations in trade matters. Realistically, with our comparative disadvantage in financial ability compared with Europe and the Americas, we cannot afford anything else. We cannot compete with their subsidies and we cannot compete with their export enhancement programs. We can only compete on a level playing field, to use a much overused phrase.
      </para>
      <para>
       These policy directions will give us a great deal of negotiating strength in the current round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, which is where a level playing field will be achieved-if it ever is. We can be optimistic and hope that this leads to some countervailing action on the part of other important world traders to reduce their own inefficient protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       The most important effect of these proposals is the effect that they will have in our domestic economy. No longer will we attempt to protect ourselves from the cutthroat nature of world trade. The years of hiding behind tariff walls and seeing our industries fail to compete-the black years of McEwenism-are over. We must either learn to compete as a nation or accept a decline in our relative standard of living. I honestly believe that we will learn to compete, that we can take on the world and, if not beat it, at least hold our own.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact that this Government has taken us so far along the path of competing internationally, the fact that as a society and as an economy we are so universally focused and aware of the job ahead, and the fact that this Government has put in place economic policy settings over a number of years which should allow us to compete effectively throughout the world is a great credit to this Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Micro-economic reform is under way. There is still much to do in this area, and no one statement can be expected to provide the answers. To quote an almost sympathetic editorial:
      </para>
      <para>
       It-
      </para>
      <para>
       the industry statement-
      </para>
      <para>
       rightly rejects the newly fashionable arguments for protection. It largely ignores the demands for the Government to increase subsidies for exporters. And, in the midst of a recession, it takes politically difficult decisions to cut protection to the most inefficient sectors of manufacturing. It is a more courageous document that Australians once would have expected from their leaders.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators would no doubt be surprised to learn that there was a time in this country's history when Australians were the highest per capita users of patent medicine in the world. We were the kings of snake oil. I think the criticism of the industry statement bears this out to a degree. There is an apparent desire for simple, one-stop solutions to the complex problems facing us. The Opposition, in the role of snake oil salesmen desperately trying to unload policies like deregulation of the labour market and a consumption tax onto an unsuspecting public, provides no answers that any sane society would be brave enough to try.
      </para>
      <para>
       The policy settings are in place, the business community knows the task ahead, and the union movement is committed. Only a Labor government could achieve all that. There are no easy solutions. The snake oil salesmen cannot be trusted. This statement never set out to rectify our economic problems in one fell swoop and to criticise it on that basis is to commit an injustice upon it. This statement is a step in the right direction, but it was never going to be anything but a long, hard road.

        —It was said by many before the industry statement was released on Tuesday that it would be important and would be examined as importantly and as closely for what it did not contain as for what it did. Today's debate on last Tuesday's industry statement by the senior Ministers of the Government has confirmed the paucity of the content in that statement. The statement is obviously a political document. It is particularly political in the sense that it is a lowest common denominator document. It is a document that was cobbled together to put together those elements that could be agreed between the different factions of the Australian Labor Party and that could be agreed between the Hawke Government and the trade union movement. The net result of that, of course, is that we have a statement which says very little indeed-it is far too little, too late. It has no coherent or cohesive strategy to it; it does not tackle the basic problems of micro-economic reform at all. To the extent that it does tackle micro-economic reform, it does so in a minimal way, and it tackles macro-economic policy not at all.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the statement there is virtually no reference at all to the broad macro-economic policy issues that are required if we are going to have an environment in Australia in which industry is going to be able to compete productively, in which employment and investment are going to grow, and in which we are going to seriously tackle our huge foreign debt problem and our balance of payments crisis.
      </para>
      <para>
       The main criticism I have of the statement is, as I have said, that it is a cobbled together statement of a whole mishmash of small bits and pieces with no real economic policy framework to put those pieces together. That is not to say that the statement is completely without merit. Of course, there are some very worthwhile movements and developments in the statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have welcomed the changes to the depreciation arrangements, for example, although they do not go far enough. We have welcomed the Government's decisions in relation to the reduction in tariffs, although it has made a fundamental mistake in not making that tariff reform part of a wider reform based particularly around micro-economic changes; that is, changes to make our manufacturing industry and all other industries able to operate on a lower cost and more efficient basis. The Government has not removed any of the major impediments to greater production and productivity. Nevertheless, the tariff decisions are certainly in the right direction.
      </para>
      <para>
       The tax deductibility changes for environmental impact statements are again in the right direction. The speeding up of and changes in the anti-dumping examination arrangements are sensible, and there are other measures about which one could comment equally favourably. But, as I said at the outset, those issues and those decisions are really very small beer in the totality of what is required to put this Australia right; to actually build a competitive Australia which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says the statements are all about. It does not do that at all and, as the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, said in his initial comment on the industry statement:
      </para>
      <para>
       The statement fails to come to grips with the reality of our economic crisis and with the magnitude of the policy adjustment required to eliminate inflation, to boost production, to boost exports and to boost import replacement activity so as to stabilise and ultimately reduce our debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       Today, in response to a question from me in the Senate at Question Time, Senator Button admitted that this industry statement really had nothing to do at all with trying to tackle our chronic current account deficit and the balance of payments, or our chronic debt problem. This debt problem now threatens to become built into our system in such an intractable way that it will hamper economic growth and development and employment and investment in this country between now and the end of the century.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was only during the election campaign last year that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that by 1992 our foreign debt situation would be stabilised. What has happened since then is that the foreign debt situation has continued to deteriorate, but our foreign debt problem is not addressed at all in the industry statement. It was confirmed by Senator Button today that it was not intended to be.
      </para>
      <para>
       I ask the Government as I have asked it on numerous occasions-as have many others from the coalition: what is the Government going to do in terms of strategies to tackle our foreign debt and balance of payments problem? Because if we do not tackle those problems, we are going to continue to be hindered, in terms of growth and development and employment, by bouncing up against a balance of payments crisis every time we get a healthy growth in demand in this country. The only way to tackle that problem is to free up the productive capacity of this country and to give the talents and skills of our people and the use of our resources free rein so that we can be a more productive, producing society; so that we can meet the demands that we, as Australians and consumers, very rightly expect of our economic system.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the fundamental problem that we have in this country. We have a perfectly understandable and correct demand situation. People do want to be able to buy, consume and invest. The only way one can do that is if one gets the supply side of the whole thing right. The fundamental flaw in the whole economic strategy of this Government is that it has failed to do that. Indeed, the policies which it has adopted have worked in the opposite way; they have been counterproductive.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was delighted, but I must say surprised, to hear the Prime Minister admit for the first time on Tuesday in his statement that the Government had got its economic policy making wrong over the last two or three years by an excessive reliance on monetary policy. That reliance on monetary policy has forced interest rates to the highest level in the Western world. It has made investment in this country virtually out of competitive reach of most producers or investors, and it has put the Australian exchange rate to a level much higher than what its real value is.
      </para>
      <para>
       All that has happened because the Government has failed, for whatever reason, to adopt other policies-particularly in terms of its Budget and wages policies-complementary to monetary policy. Instead, because it has failed so badly on Budget policy, because it has refused to free up in any significant way the wage fixing system in this country, and because it has refused to allow employers and employees to talk together, to negotiate together, to get together and agree together on proper, appropriate terms and conditions of employment, the Government has therefore been forced to have a monetary policy which is absolutely excessive and which has crippled development in this country. This policy has crippled development not just in terms of investment, manufacturing and productive activities, but it has also crippled scores of thousands of households in Australia, hundreds of thousands of individuals and has made life a misery for countless Australians-when there was never reason why that should have been the case.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the Government was really serious in wanting Australians to believe that it was trying to produce and build a competitive Australia, the first thing it would have had to start with was to look at those fundamental broad policy directions that one needs to adopt and pursue if the other important policies-but of a lesser level-are going to have the impact that is necessary. That is a longish way of saying that one cannot get successful micro-economic reform-even if one tackles it seriously, which this Government is not doing-unless one has a proper macro-economic environment. Unless the broad brush picture is right, the smaller detailed picture will never be right.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is being realised by more and more commentators and more and more industries in Australia. The only people who now do not realise that are the Government and the supporters of the Government. I am not a trade union basher, as I think my colleagues in the Senate would know, but it is a fact that the inability of the trade union movement to accept and adapt to fundamental necessary change in this country is reinforcing the rigidities and the problems that we have. Unless there is a fundamental change in attitude-throughout the trade union movement, and I must say throughout much of management as well and, indeed, much of the Australian community because it is not just a one-sided issue-then we are going to hobble ourselves quite unnecessarily and severely for the remainder of this century.
      </para>
      <para>
       I return to the industry statement. Most people are now starting to realise many of those problems. The industry statement has had a dreadful response throughout the media, the community and most industry groups that stand to benefit or otherwise from the statement. For example, officials of the electronics industry-a key industry that the Government sees as one of the leading lights of development in the 1990s-describes the industry statement as:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . a piecemeal range of measures hardly sufficient to reduce existing impediments to development.
      </para>
      <para>
       They also say:
      </para>
      <para>
       It would not provide incentives for industry to increase investment, research and development or exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Chamber of Commerce says that the `Key issues fail to take the centre stage'. The Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Ian Fletcher, says:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister's industry statement is little more than a package of Band-aids.
      </para>
      <para>
       When bold and decisive action was required to deal with our fundamental economic problems, the nation was presented with a statement long on rhetoric and short on real action.

      </para>
      <para>
       The Confederation of Australian Industry, one of the major industry bodies in this country, said much the same. It drew particular attention to the position facing small business. Its Executive Director, Ian Spicer said:
      </para>
      <para>
       By making only a cursory reference to Small Business Development in the statements made by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Industry Minister, the Government confirms that it does not understand the critical function that small business must perform if the Government's ultimate goal of Building a Competitive Australia is to be achieved.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Mining Industry Council, which represents the major miners of this country and major contributors to our exports and therefore critical to our future economic development says the statement has `gone only halfway to establishing a dynamic economy'.

       Representatives of the rural sector, which is in great and deep crisis, made similar comments. The former Minister for Science and Technology and a colleague of Senator Button and others in government, Barry Jones, who is still a member of this Parliament, put it very well when he was quoted in the press today as saying:
      </para>
      <para>
       The manufacturing sector `would not make it' unless the Government's economic statement was immediately followed with stronger measures . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       He also said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The statement was a step in the right direction, but should have come eight years ago when the Government was first elected . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       That is absolutely true. This Government is a government of inertia. It is not true, as the Prime Minister, Treasurer and other Ministers have tried to delude the Australian community into believing, that it has been an active or a proactive and initiating government. This Government has not been an initiating government.
      </para>
      <para>
       If one looks at the policy changes that this Government has made during its eight years in office, one will find that almost without exception they have been decisions reacting to pressures that have been put on it. One can go right back to the 1983 or 1984 decision, admirable decision though it was, of floating the dollar back in the early period of the Government's tenure of office. That was a reaction to the recurring crises that were being caused by speculative raids on our currency. The Government did the right thing but it did it for the wrong reasons. It did it because it was forced into it, not because it was its own decision. One can level much the same comment at virtually everything that this Government has done.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not possible for this Government to say that it has been inactive and retarded in any way by the coalition. The Liberal-National Party coalition has, almost without exception over the last eight years, been positive in wanting to work with the Government to have the desirable and proper changes made to the structure of the Australian economy so that we can have, once again, the prosperous, flourishing and enterprising economy and society that we had particularly throughout the 1950s and the 1960s. That was a prosperity and a flowering of Australian economic history, which was crushed during the three years of the Whitlam Government and which it has taken a great deal of time to retrieve.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Fraser Government had difficulty in doing that. So has the Hawke Government. But the Hawke Government has compounded the problems by its sheer refusal to take active measures to fundamentally change our economic structure. That has been due to the inhibitions that the very nature of the structure of the Australian Labor Party and the Labor movement in Australia imposes on Labor governments of the day.
      </para>
      <para>
       The industry statement is a damp squib. It is far too little far too late. It does not acknowledge the need to paint a proper productive environment through the appropriate balance of macro-economic policies, and it is amazingly silent on the enormous task that the Government has now built for itself in terms of redeveloping or redirecting a fiscal and budgetary policy in tune with the needs of the times.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been an enormous, massive deterioration in the fiscal and budgetary position of the Government this financial year. From a Budget surplus of $8.1 billion, in all probability-indeed this is accepted even now by the Treasurer-the Budget outturn for 1990-91 will be a probable move into deficit. The Government-the public sector-has once again shown the colours of traditional Labor governments by getting its hands right into the cookie jar of the nation's savings. That is a budgetary situation which is totally inimical to the needs and the interests of the Australian community.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is also one other aspect within that budgetary situation that the Government, for whatever reason I really do not know given the way that this was promoted by the Treasurer very rightly back in 1985, blindly refused to look at, and that was the introduction of a broadly based consumption tax. That is nothing short of disgraceful. As the Australian Financial Review said today in its editorial, which I commend to all senators, consumption tax is the missing link in the whole process of inducing a desirable restructuring of our economic policies, our taxation base and, therefore, the ability of the taxation system to aid rather than to hinder the further development of investment, savings and productive activity in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The changes that were announced in the industry statement to the wholesale sales tax, allegedly to remove some of the restraints or the costs on business inputs, are absolutely minuscule. A full year figure in 1992-93 will be only $375m. The wholesale sales tax raises something like $11 billion. Of that $11 billion something like $5 billion to $6 billion comes, in effect, through the tax on business inputs. The relief given in this industry statement is a whole $375m, something like 5 per cent or thereabouts of the real cost of the wholesale sales tax to business.
      </para>
      <para>
       It will do virtually nothing to alleviate the tax cost pressures on exporters and yet it is a direction of productive activity more towards exports, which is the very thing that this nation needs. So I urge the Government again to look at its intransigent attitude towards a broadly based consumption tax or a goods and services tax because its failure to do so is costing Australia and all Australians very heavily indeed.
      </para>
      <para>
       They are some of the things that I wanted to say about the industry statement. There are many things that could have been included in that statement, and should have been included in that statement, to make Australia truly the competitive Australia that the statement title very misleadingly purports it to be.
      </para>
      <para>
       The coalition's policies in the areas of Budget policy, monetary policy, wages policy, privatisation and micro-economic reform-in a meaningful way, not just rhetorically-have been spelt out very clearly by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and other coalition spokesmen. They do not need repeating here today. But there is a better way for Australia; there is a way to build a competitive Australia. Regrettably, and to the great cost of all Australians, that opportunity was not taken up on Tuesday.

       <para in-line="1">
        —There are two good things about the statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Firstly, the Prime Minister's statement and the accompanying statements by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and also, to some extent, by Senator Cook set out-as should be done from time to time-the position of the Government and the philosophy which guides it. It gives us an opportunity to see the philosophical position from which the Government is coming and from which it derives its industrial policy. After all, as an industrial society, our industrial policy is one of the things that we need to look at extremely closely.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       So I welcome these statements and the opportunity that they provide to look more broadly at where this Government is taking us and to make some criticism of that. In the course of debating individual pieces of legislation, very often we are debating detail and the philosophical position lies hidden. Very often we come to apparently different conclusions because of those different philosophies and positions which we take. Those positions are not made explicit and I believe that they should be, because that, after all, is far more important than the conclusions which we draw from those positions. Given the right starting position, and given the right philosophy, we will all come to the same conclusions and there will be no differences between us.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second reason that I welcome the statement is that the Prime Minister-not in the statement itself but outside the statement in press comments-said that he was looking at least 10 years into the future. We do need to look at least at a 10-year time span. I believe that we need to look much more extensively into the future-much further into the future. That, of course, is the right way to plan where we need to go; because unless we have a clear idea of where we are going as a society-as somebody once remarked- `you will finish up some place else'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having said that, one gets the clear impression from all these statements taken together that the Government has no clear idea of where it is going. It has no clear idea of the society that it wishes to construct: the society in which we will live 10 years hence. It is a society built entirely out of a disjointed, inappropriate econometric view of the world. I might describe the people who write a policy document like this not as members of the species homo sapiens but as members of a different species altogether: homo economus. In that group I would also put the members of the Opposition. They are working to exactly the same discredited model which simply does not fit with the world in which we must live into the next century. There is no wisdom in these statements at all. So the people who have spoken so far on this statement simply do not deserve the title homo sapiens, the Latin word for wisdom, of course, being `sapiens'. There is no wisdom in these statements and we have heard no wisdom from the Opposition.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has been recognised by leading thinkers in recent times that the decade of the 1990s is indeed a major turning point in history. It is the decade in which major changes must be made in the relationship between industrial civilisations and the environment if any civilisation is to survive into the mid-term and certainly into the distant future. Nowhere in the Prime Minister's statement-and nowhere in any of the other statements-do we find even a suggestion that these people who now lead us recognise the environmental constraints which are looming very largely before us and which are recognised by most leading thinkers in the world today.
      </para>
      <para>
       The econometric model which comes through in the Prime Minister's statement and the other statements is one of inhuman dimensions. It is one which is driven by an ideology in which humans are simply competitive units in an economically driven society in which competition is far more important than anything else. It provides us with a vision of human beings on a treadmill which is being driven faster and faster, on which we must run faster and faster merely to stay in the same position. And for what end? To serve inhuman and, ultimately, impossible economically determined ends.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a lot absolutely fundamentally wrong with these statements. The Prime Minister, Senator Button and the other Ministers who have presented these statements to us are leading Australia up a completely blind alley. This is unfortunate because the alternative vision is certainly present in Australian society. We have some of the leading edge technology which would fit with the new vision. We could, if we chose-if we were intelligent-pursue quite different directions.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have indicated in this place before, there is one index-if we wish to look for it-which must serve as a goal underpinning all industry. All industry depends ultimately upon the use of energy. The release of energy in industrial societies-industrial civilisations-around the globe has led us to a position where we face an imminent greenhouse warming of the planet with enormous and probably quite unpredictable consequences for every aspect not only of human civilisation but of life on the planet as a whole.
      </para>
      <para>
       Globally we set up an inter-governmental panel on climate control comprising a number of experts in this area. The panel's recommendation-made only last year-was that as a matter of urgency the world had to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent, as rapidly as possible. That is not to bring the greenhouse gas levels down to the levels before industrialisation got under way; we need to do that simply to cause those levels to plateau, and to plateau at a level which inevitably will have quite far-reaching consequences.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we translate that figure into the profligate release of these greenhouse gases by Australia, that means that Australia needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 92 per cent as rapidly as possible. That surely is the overriding factor which needs to be taken into account in designing industry over the next decade. That is totally ignored in the Prime Minister's statement. That view is shared by a significant number of Australians. I point to the Saulwick poll in the Age of 26 December 1990, which asked Australians a number of questions. One question asked: do environmental groups make reasonable demands? The poll found that 63 per cent of voters thought the demands made by such groups were reasonable. Only 28 per cent of Australians thought the demands made by environmental groups were unreasonable. Seventy-nine per cent of the voters said that the threat to the environment was real and had to be taken seriously, while fewer than one in five-fewer than 20 per cent-said that green activists made too much fuss about this threat.
      </para>
      <para>
       The latest poll showed that 62 per cent of voters said Australia should concentrate on protecting the environment even if it meant some reduction in economic growth. If one looks at the age and gender distribution of these people, one sees that concern for the environment was higher among women, young voters and-need I say it?-supporters of the Australian Democrats and, to some extent, the Australian Labor Party. Eighty-two per cent of the people aged 18 to 24 said the demands made by environmentalists were reasonable, compared with only 47 per cent of those over the age of 55. If one were to look around this chamber-if honourable senators were in here-one would find a very unrepresentative group in terms of the declared concern by the Australian public over this very fundamental question, a concern which one finds nowhere expressed in the Prime Minister's statement. The Prime Minister has totally ignored the environment. In fact, the word `environment' appears in his statement only to the extent that he addresses the issue of so-called resource security, which is to parcel away parts of the environment for the exclusive, exploitative use of parts of the timber industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       One finds the word `environment' in Senator Button's statement only linked to the word `economic'. Senator Button seems to be quite unaware that ultimately we are dependent upon the natural environment both for our survival and for the continuation of our industry. We are not separate living organisms who can build societies, who can build industry, detached from the realities of the real world. In order to recognise the constraints which the environment places upon us, I point to the German philosopher Haeckel who, way back in the middle of the last century, used one of the wisest aphorisms I have seen anywhere when he said that freedom is the recognition of necessity; in other words, one is free only to the extent that one recognises the constraints within which one operates.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will be free in this country-and, indeed, in any other-to establish an industrial civilisation which is sustainable in the long term only to the extent that we recognise the constraints within which we operate. That major constraint which is looming large-which most experts recognise but this Government fails to recognise-is the constraint imposed by the use of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide and other industrially generated gases to the atmosphere. What sort of a different society would this be? The Government in its statements clearly considers that in the next century we will live in a more global economy where there is more trade, particularly in goods. Informed people are already seriously talking about the imposition of a carbon emission tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       Among the things that will be impacted upon most strongly as we come to recognise the inevitability of restricting our use of fossil fuels will be transport and trade, which will not expand. Transport and trade indeed will diminish. The world of tomorrow will not be a global community in which there is massive trade in goods; it will be a world in which peoples at all levels will be increasingly self-sufficient and the trade which will occur will be trade in ideas and information, which require increasingly less energy for their transmission. The bulk transmission of goods will become severely restricted in a greenhouse world. That suggests immediately that, in terms of the imbalance in trade at present, we should not look towards increasing exports but towards import replacement. That is the strategy which will fit the greenhouse world.
      </para>
      <para>
       It means that we should not divide up our transport system in this country as we have, and say to Australian National, `You produce a profit at the bottom line and don't take into account any problems in relation to road damage or other modes of transport', so that we have Australian National closing railway lines, ripping up tracks and tearing down the bridges simply to make a profit and putting more energy intensive uses of transport onto our road system. It means that we should develop the technologies which are able to meet those sorts of greenhouse targets-and in this country we have leading edge technology in the area of transport. In the University of New South Wales we have produced the most efficient photovoltaic cells in the world. We have in Sydney a man who has been attempting to build an electric car for use in this country for over 10 years without government support-a well-known engineer who designed Sydney's double decker trains. We have in the University of Sydney a design for an electric vehicle which could meet 70 per cent of all private motor vehicle transport needs and be totally solar driven.
      </para>
      <para>
       This technology is not receiving the support which it should be getting. This technology provides an industrial base which not only we but the rest of the world will need in the years ahead because it is technology which will meet that 92 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases of which I spoke earlier.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we look at our balance of trade and our debt, we find that $27 billion, roughly a quarter of our total debt, is owed by State electricity utilities that have never looked to energy efficiency but have simply looked-like a lot of private industrial concerns-to expand their own hegemony over the provision of electricity, causing the most inefficient use of electricity. We do not find any remarks at all in the Prime Minister's statement about impacting on the massive debt, the increasing debt, borne by those State utilities, several of which want to continue to build unnecessary power stations. I point to Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. We do not need these power stations which, if the best predictions in relation to greenhouse are correct, will never be able to generate the cash flow required to pay them off. We find that the Prime Minister fails to recognise this as any sort of a problem, because he is looking in a different direction.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn specifically to the Prime Minister's statement on the so-called resource security. We were promised a statement which would say a great deal about the detail in relation to the protection of the environment. What do we find? We find very little detail in the Prime Minister's statement and very little detail in the addendum to the Prime Minister's statement and we find a number of totally inaccurate statements and assertions. The Prime Minister says:
      </para>
      <para>
       But we recognise that-in part due to this commitment-
      </para>
      <para>
       that is, commitment to looking after the environment-
      </para>
      <para>
       there has been a contraction of the forest resource allocated to existing operations in the industry. Concern about future access to the resource has made new investment uncertain.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we look at the actual figures, we see that there has been an expansion in recent years in the amount of resource available to the forestry industry; there has not been a contraction at all. Moreover, the forestry industry is still well within the allocation of resource which it has available to it. Even with the increased areas set aside for conservation purposes, it would be some time before the forestry industry came up against any sort of limitation on access to resources, so the Prime Minister is quite wrong. The Prime Minister also said that he took this action of moving towards so-called resource security `only after receiving unqualified legal advice that it was the sole way the Commonwealth could provide a binding undertaking of the kind necessary to get major projects started which will provide new exports and new jobs'.
      </para>
      <para>
       I ask the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, who is in the chamber, to table that legal advice. I, and many people in the environment movement, would be very interested to see that unqualified legal advice which said that that was the only way that these industries could be established. Frankly, I do not believe it. I do not believe that that was the reason for this action to be taken. On the same page in the Prime Minister's statement there is reference to becoming a `clever country'. The Prime Minister states:
      </para>
      <para>
       This does not necessarily mean working harder; in Germany and Japan, both highly successful competitive countries, working hours are actually falling.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to read some quotations from an article about Germany's secrets of success by Tim Colebatch in the Age of 19 February. He points to the massive investment which Germany is making in education and training, far greater than Australia. Germany is certainly becoming the clever country. The article states:

       $32,000 award wage and huge pension? There's something else you should know about him. He was at school until he was 19: in an affluent state system run by some of the world's best-paid teachers.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government has contracted support for education-
      </para>
      <para>
       Moreover, German schooling is tough. Each year he faced real exams, and those who failed-10 or 15 per cent-had to stay down and repeat.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tim Colebatch continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       The main reason for Germany's economic success is the quality of its products. German companies dominate four huge industries-motor vehicles, industrial machinery, chemicals and electrical apparatus-because they make the best products in the world. And they do so by investing heavily in new products and processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1986, on OECD figures, Australian manufacturers spent $1 in every $200 they earned on research and product development. German manufacturers spent five times as much; $1 in every $40 was ploughed into staying at the top of the learning curve. German business has very different priorities, and they have worked; German companies now supply one in five patent applications lodged in the Western World.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to working harder, the Prime Minister clearly does not understand what that does in terms of global equity. There are two inputs to industrial production; there are two inputs to gross domestic product (GDP)-the measure which the Prime Minister and the Opposition wish to see grow-material resource input and labour input. Economic growth, as desired by the Government and the Opposition, meaning growth of gross domestic product, therefore means a growth in the consumption of one or both of these inputs. The question is: are there limits to growth in the consumption of either or both of these inputs?
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have already pointed out in relation to the inputs-one of the inputs is the capacity of the atmosphere to absorb polluting gases which are causing the greenhouse effect-there are limits to the input of resources. We do, after all, live in a finite planet. Exponential growth in material consumption of resources clearly has limits. Energy consumption is a clear cause of greenhouse gas emissions and escalating changes in the composition of the global atmosphere. Energy use is closely linked with the extraction and use of all other material resources, so continued growth in the consumption of material resources is incompatible with ecological sustainability.
      </para>
      <para>
       What of labour, the other resource that the Prime Minister mentions? The United States and Japan have recently experienced economies growing much more rapidly than the increase in their material resource use. Their material input to GDP has in fact declined. The labour content of GDP has increased far more rapidly, making a shift from material resource input to labour input. But labour is also limited. There are only 24 hours in a day and 8,760 hours in a year-the time interval over which GDP is measured. Everyone has the same number of hours available for work. People cannot buy hours and add them to their equitable quota.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are only three ways in which an individual, a community or a country can increase the value of the labour component of GDP; work harder or more hours, increase the value of one's hours vis-a-vis the value of the work of others-and I stress that-or increase the value of one's work compared to the work of others. Working more hours or working harder at the same job clearly has strict limits. Moreover, one should seriously question the sanity of any society that sought merely to make its citizens work harder and harder merely to chase a growing GDP. Doing the same work or even doing different work and charging more for one's time involves taking an advantage over another in a zero sum game.
      </para>
      <para>
       The zero sum nature of the labour component of GDP is important to grasp. It arises out of the fixed and equal number of hours available to everyone.
      </para>
      <para>
       If a pilot charges three times as much per hour for his time as I do for my skill, then I must work three hours to buy one hour of his. As his fortune rises, so my fortune falls and in a precisely reciprocal way and to a precisely reciprocal extent. So it is between nations. If the Japanese charge more per hour for their time, Australians must spend more time to buy the products of Japanese labour. Inequity places strict limits on growth through this course.
      </para>
      <para>
       This analysis also means that human inventiveness will not cause global economic growth but may allow one person, group or nation to grow at the expense of another. For those who are being left behind by competitive labour costs there is one temporary solution; that is, to attempt to feed their economic growth by increasing the rate of exploitation of material resources. As we have seen, that has strict limits.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tonight we will debate the private member's Bill which I have introduced in relation to the importation of tropical rain forests. What we see there, par excellence, is an example of people being forced to over-exploit resources simply to continue to maintain some standard of living in a competitive world. So here we see how countries with growing economies, even those with relatively declining material input to their growth, exacerbate environmental despoliation and depress resource prices in those countries struggling but failing to make their economies grow. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), when he uses the oxymoron sustainable growth, does not know what he is talking about.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I welcome the opportunity to debate these fundamental philosophical matters. They are important. We should have more debate on these matters, but I am afraid that the Government has no clear idea of where it needs to position Australia in the future. Indeed, it is taking Australia up a blind alley because it has failed to recognise the imperative dictates of the environment.

        —Today we are debating the Government's industry statement, which was put down two days ago. This statement, for which we have all been waiting, is truly consistent with the economic performance of the Hawke Government in its declining days. It is an exercise of too little too late. This is the resounding response not only from the business community but also from this Government's former science Minister. For a second I will concentrate on that one point. Not just the coalition is saying that the Government has not gone far enough; there are people in the Government who totally agree with that position.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The greatest burden hampering the private sector today is taxation and low productivity resulting from the lack of labour market reform. Where is the labour market reform in Tuesday's statement? It is absolutely nowhere to be seen. What has been said that will make it easier for employees to sit down with employers to work out their own agreements, not merely to save jobs in the recession that we `had to have', but also to build real productivity? Absolutely nothing has been said that will do any of that. At once the major differences between this tired Labor Government and the coalition become obvious. We got the message a long time ago that without the freeing of the labour market, reforms in tariffs or any other area would not allow Australia to compete and to survive.

       Nothing in this statement will change the facts revealed in Perth last month that compulsory unionism, supported by the Hawke Labor Government and of course its political master, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), continues to perpetuate rorts in the multimillion dollar construction industry. A fourth year apprentice on a Perth construction site grosses $900 a week and the lollipop man with the Stop-Go sign clears $800 a week.
      </para>
      <para>
       Yet week after week the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, gets up in this place and says how dreadful it is that the executive salaries and packages in this country are too high. If he can stand up here pretending to know all and say that he condones fourth year apprentices on construction sites grossing $900 a week and the lollipop men clearing $800 a week, I will go he. I asked him a question about this in the Senate only a few weeks ago, which naturally he refused to answer. This is his area, yet he completely ignores the realities of how he is crippling the construction industry.

       I say again and again that these extortionate wage levels upheld by union muscle is the reason that business is struggling and a major reason why today we learn that in Western Australia one member in 10 of the work force is out of a job. Once again, we had another debate in this place only the other day. We talked about the realities and the concern that this recession-cum-depression is causing the people of Australia. Not one Government senator was able to recognise the realities of that concern in the community. We will not build any kind of clever country when our rigid and corrupt industrial relations system gives a Sydney crane driver a gross income of $130,000 annually compared with $120,000 for the captain of a 747.

      <para>
       Everyone in this country will remember a dispute not so long ago-about 18 months ago-when the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Hawke, absolutely condemned pilots for being lazy, for not earning their money. At that time most of those pilots were not earning anywhere near the $120,000 that a captain of a 747 earns today, let alone anywhere near the $130,000 that a crane driver earns. But do we hear the Prime Minister or Senator Cook saying that that is absurd and that the crane drivers should not be earning that amount of money? Of course not.
      </para>
      <para>
       Only today it was reported in the Australian Financial Review that the ACTU is hoping to do a deal with the Australian Democrats to ensure that a centralised wage system endures beyond the inevitable demise of the Hawke Labor Government. This same Government will do all that it can to further this process. The sad reality is that the Australian Democrats will probably buy that argument from the ACTU because the Democrats do not have any policies. Their only policy is promising everything and anything to the world, knowing full well that they will never have to deliver. They can afford to pretend to be all things to all people. But at the end of the day, as with the Gulf war, we will see quite clearly where they stand.

       We have of course heard all about productivity breakthroughs on the waterfront. The coalition welcomes every improvement to a situation that has proven a massive impost on our export industries. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of deliberate exaggeration as to the progress of reform when the productivity gains made by Conaust Pty Ltd have resulted from the sidestepping of the Government's own program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Unfortunately, we do not have long to go before the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, will resign. As Senator Walters said, Senator Collins has of today only 53 more sleeps before he resigns because he has not been able to deliver true reform on the waterfront. The Government has failed to meet its targets in cutting the waterfront labour force. Of the 500 redundancies scheduled to be processed by the end of September, not one was achieved by that date.
      </para>
      <para>
       The end of March will see 451 redundancies, not even the September target. And 213 new waterside workers have been employed. Some reform! Of course, productivity on the waterfront is improving. It had to. That is nothing to be proud of at the moment at least, because it simply had to. But it is lagging far behind such trading partners as Britain and New Zealand. This is the heart of the problem-this Labor Government does not have the intestinal fortitude to tackle the problem fully.
      </para>
      <para>
       Only last month the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), whose area of responsibility is at the sharp end of waterfront costs, conceded that reform was proceeding too slowly. Sadly, he does not communicate that with Senator Collins, the Minister responsible. They both go off in their own ways, both leading the country down the mine, with no communication and no reform. It is all very fine for the Minister to deplore the attitudes of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, but when will the Hawke Labor Government do anything about it? This Government has decided on a conciliatory approach that in fact results in union veto over the pace and nature of reform. Needless to say, the statement does not tackle the related problem of the union-upheld trans- Tasman shipping monopoly. It will still be cheaper to ship a container from Melbourne to Auckland via Hong Kong than it is to ship it direct.
      </para>
      <para>
       Lack of labour market reform is one glaring omission of the statement. Of course, lack of real tax reform is another. We hear all about changes to sales tax. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has not dared to brag about the end of the special 50 per cent punitive rate of tax on luxury cars. Have we heard one syllable from the Government that it goofed, that it made a mistake, that it was wrong and that it has cost this country and the people of this country millions of dollars? No. This Government now has to admit that it has destroyed jobs and businesses for no reason other than political grandstanding. It ignored the basic common sense rule that if taxes are raised arbitrarily, purchasing patterns will change and revenue collection will fall. This is quite apart from the economic damage that is done to a particular section of industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       This result bears out exactly what the coalition was saying less than 12 months ago, that is, that this was a tax based on appeal to envy to reaffirm the support of Labor's grass roots. Of course, we know that the Australian Democrats are expedient in that regard also. They constantly use the yardstick of the politics of envy. They too supported this tax. Sometimes this Government cynically underestimates the good sense of its own supporters. As I say, the Democrats must share the blame for the pathetic outcome of such a move. The Government's stupid attack on luxury cars, with antique clocks carefully ignored, I might add, is a powerful illustration of the coalition case against sales tax and in favour of a fair, logical, goods and services tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sadly of course for the people of Australia, probably they are not going to get a particularly fair debate on the subject of goods and services tax. It was only yesterday that I saw an article written by Senator Maguire in a Labor Party newspaper called the Herald. There were just so many untruths in that article that one cannot even begin to list them. But at a later date I will bring them before the Senate and attempt to counteract them. That is the type of campaign that the Government is going to undertake. It will not be telling the truth. It will simply exaggerate right the way down the line.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sales tax is all about governments and officials making arbitrary and complex judgments about what constitutes a luxury or what is a so-called necessity. Businesses which actually pay the tax on behalf of the whole community know that it is about revenue; revenue that this Government has put up by 206 per cent since it came to office. How many people in the community realise how much sales tax they are paying? How many realise that they are now paying an additional 206 per cent more sales tax than they were in 1983 when this Government came to office?
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia needs an indirect tax that is honest and visible so that all people will know how much they are paying, when the tax is increased, and on what products it is imposed. People need an indirect tax that is not subject to political whims or complex litigation as, for example, when confectionery manufacturers fought a fruitless and expensive legal challenge on the status of sugar coated nuts.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) are, of course, bragging about other changes to sales tax, supposedly ending its application to business inputs. They are giving some recognition to another major scandal inherent in this unjust tax that costs exporters $1.2 billion. What we are being given is not real reform-just like the labour market saga-but window dressing that purports to have countered the coalition case for genuine reform that would exempt exports and levy the tax at the point of sale. We are told that sales tax revenue will be cut by $200m in the next financial year and by $375m in 1992-93. This latter figure amounts to less than 4 per cent of the sales tax revenue for 1990-91 anticipated in the Budget papers.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, it is estimated that the actual amount of sales tax collected from business inputs is between $5 billion and $6 billion. Last year the Victorian Employers Federation estimated that half of total sales tax derived from inputs. Clearly, therefore, when the small print is made real for the business community it will be seen that tax will continue to be paid on a great many production costs. As before, the cost of compliance will be borne by businesses which will pay the extortionate penalties if they get it wrong. Not for the first time, tax reductions may be eaten up in increased compliance costs that weigh so heavily on smaller business.
      </para>
      <para>
       It would have been too much for this Government to have asked the business community whether it wanted a complete change to the existing failed system of indirect taxation. The 1990 Arthur Anderson national small business survey showed 75 per cent support for the kind of goods and services tax that the coalition is proposing. It is no accident that the business associations calling for reform represent small business and service industries that are outside the scope of sales tax. These people know a bad tax when they see one.
      </para>
      <para>
       This statement is not going to result in much change to the $1.2 billion paid in indirect taxation by export industries in 1990-91, including a tax rate of over 4 per cent on forest products and over 6 per cent on transport equipment. The cost effect of this latter figure, impacting on rural export, hardly needs to be spelt out. The farmers are struggling. The farmers are dying from the pressures put on them by this Government. They are walking off the land in unprecedented numbers. They are going broke at an unprecedented rate. As we have stated quite clearly in the Senate this afternoon, the Government does not seem to care about the future of our rural sector in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       A cut of $375m-that would be proportionally less in the 1990-91 context-is still going to leave Australian exporters with an imposition from which they will be freed by the coalition alternative. All the tinkering with sales tax in the Government's industry statement points to one inescapable fact: the Hawke Labor Government knows that it has a rotting lemon on its hands, that it is being unfair and harmful to the very people such a statement is supposed to assist. The Government knows that the coalition is putting forward a concept similar to the 1985 plan that the Treasurer was forced to abandon. As with labour market reform, the Hawke Labor Government no longer has the courage, if it ever did have it, to institute reforms that it knows are right for Australia. Whatever happened to the 1984 principles for taxation reform? They were just thrown out of the window. Taxes must not add to the overall burden. They must be simple, fair, neutral, and make evasion more difficult. The coalition proposes such reform through a goods and services tax. This Government responds with cheap politics.
      </para>
      <para>
       Stripped of the rhetoric, labor market reform and tax changes are the crucial needs of industry. Here the Government has failed. The coalition welcomes the commitment to lowering protection. But here the Government has simply moved towards the firm coalition commitment of eliminating protection altogether.
      </para>
      <para>
       Resource security legislation is only a belated recognition that Australia's economic future and real sustainable development had earlier been sacrificed to the buying of green preference votes. It remains to be seen whether the actual legislation will deliver genuine resource security to export industries that ultimately provide the national wealth without which we cannot protect our environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       This statement does not address the deepest problems that hamper our industry and its productivity. In pointing this out, I am proud to have been able to restate the fact that the coalition does have firm policies in the area of labour market and indirect tax reform. It is a pity that the Government has not seen fit to avail itself of the offer that is constantly being repeated by Dr Hewson of bipartisan support for policies that will get this country back on the road to success.

        —Australia has waited with bated breath for the Government's industry statement. The need for direction from the Government is at a crisis point. No-one would argue with that. People in all walks of life are crying out for some positive Government direction. The Government has been active in providing policy and direction that have had a negative impact. The Government's policy of slowing the Australian economy by using high interest rates is exactly why Australia is in its present state. In Australia's economic environment high inflation has resulted in high interest rates. As a consequence there are the associated problems of trade imbalances, high exchange rates and spiralling wages and prices as well as other economic woes.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Ironically, the Government's approach to easing the balance of payments problem by raising interest rates may in itself have been the greatest single cause of the continuation of high deficits and growing debt levels. These massive and debilitating problems which all Australians face today are the reason the Government owed Australia a proper industry statement on Tuesday.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are told that tariff levels are to fall across the board from the present 10 to 15 per cent to 5 per cent by 1996. While Australia is cutting its protection to primary industries, the rest of the world is increasing theirs, with America and the European Community (EC) outbidding each other on subsidies. Dr Blewett, the Minister responsible for trade, has already convinced the Government to lift the sugar embargo, to lower tariffs to 10 per cent on primary products-now being further lowered to 5 per cent-and to regulate our wheat industry. Had it not been for the vigorous defence of the Australian Wheat Board by the National Party, the Wheat Board would have lost its single seller export status. I can assure the Senate that the overseas wheat exporting countries would have congratulated Dr Blewett and told him what a great fellow he was. That would be to his face; behind his back they would have laughed at him.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact is that Australia has shown its hand and surrendered every bargaining chip that it has ever put on the table to try to take the world down the free trade path. But the world has not responded. The answers to our pleas have been that the EC has increased its subsidies by $5 billion to $23 billion this year, while America has introduced the 1991 Farm Bill, increasing its export enhancement programs by $425m to $900m this year and $1.2 billion next year. Last week we saw a bipartisan parliamentary delegation head off to America to plead with the American Administration to stop subsidising, as the world market is being driven down below the cost of production. We saw a spokesman from the American wheat lobby on television telling us to mind our own business and that the American Administration would make the decisions on how it would dispose of its grain.
      </para>
      <para>
       That might be all right for the American wheat lobby and the American farmers, who are guaranteed $175 per tonne net, but our farmers are playing the game in the world market, receiving no guarantees for their crop and having to match subsidised world prices. The Australian net price to farmers is between $60 and $70 a tonne. A third of our farmers are so desperate that they will not have the cash flow to plant next season's crop. We have gone down the road to further reducing tariffs on agricultural products.
      </para>

       I want to raise the question of what could be called secondary dumping. I am glad that Senator Childs is in the chamber because he is one person who understands this, in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I wish that Senator Button were here so that I could explain this to him. However, I will have to rely on Senator Childs getting him in a corner and explaining it to him.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is immense corruption on the world market in primary industry commodities as the EC and America subsidise against each other in an ever increasing trade war. The world price of commodities is driven down; the prices are neither fair nor equitable; they are distorted and corrupted. These prices become world prices and ultimately become domestic prices-the prices that our farmers are paid for their domestic market products. The grossest trade distortion of all is when Australian farmers get prices which are less than the cost of their production on their own domestic market.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our farmers are under tremendous pressure. They have to compete on overseas markets that are corrupted by subsidies. We have to wear that. That is part of the game, I suppose. But surely it is unreasonable for them to have to take the corrupt world market price as a domestic price. I hope that Senator Button is listening to this on his video. As the Minister responsible, I ask him to ask the Government committee on anti-dumping that was mentioned in the statement and also the Senate committee to take a reference on the hurt caused by secondary dumping of agricultural products. That is very important.
      </para>
      <para>
       Primary industries and many other industries have already made the sacrifice of tariff cuts and are going through the pain of adjustment. They have already done their bit to enable the Australian Government to lead its crusade in the international arena for worldwide free trade. Everyone knows-if they do not know, they should know-that there is not a level playing field for Australia's unprotected industries. Australian industries are meant to play a virtuous role and to compete with highly subsidised United States and EC products and the government levies that they attract. Not only industry but the whole Australian economy will flounder as a consequence. Tariff cuts cannot be the only tool. To just cut tariffs is to sacrifice many more Australian industries, with resultant unemployment. Before the industry statement, industry made it known to the Government that what was needed was no more tariff cuts without meaningful reforms which would enable them to be more competitive.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us look at some of the impositions that industry has to work under. It must be remembered that this is in an immediate climate of impossible interest rates for investment, decreasing sales, decreasing profits and returns, and increasing bankruptcies. During the past two years wages have gone up 10.6 per cent. On-costs are now running at about 25 to 30 per cent, as a percentage of wages, to industry. Oncosts have been allowed to escalate while industry has been going through a massive decline. Bankruptcies have risen 56 per cent in the last quarter. It must be an indication to the Government that business cannot afford the impost of these ever increasing costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are always new costs for industry to meet. The cost effect of the 38-hour week has added 5 to 6 per cent to wage costs after its introduction. Unfortunately, the effect of the 1987 radically different wage system is imposing very real and very large costs on industry. The aim of the accord was to lead to real improvements in productivity and efficiency with the elimination of inefficient and wasteful work practices. But what has happened is that industry has had to pay the money-that is, the wage increases-in return for a promise by the unions to look at efficiency improvements at some future time. I will concede that there have been some efficiency improvements in some of the bigger industries, but in small business they have not happened.
      </para>
      <para>
       In real terms there has been little, if any, real improvement in efficiency and productivity coming from award restructuring. The present national wage system is imposing the following further costs for business, according to the paper on labour costs by the Queensland Confederation of Industry Ltd. I have explained these figures to some Labor people, who have looked at me and said that they do not really believe me. I shall put these figures on the record today so that Senator Jones and other people will be able to study them. I also recommend that Senator Bryant Burns study them.
      </para>
      <para>
       The structural efficiency principle has cost 6.5 per cent. The classification creep that has been the unintended consequence of award restructuring adds a further one per cent. The increase in minimum wages adds a further 1.5 per cent. Wage drift accounts for a further 2 per cent. This sort of outcome will produce an inflation rate of about 10 per cent. On top of the structural efficiency principle-costs of about 11 per cent-there are other costs. These are genuine costs taken from the aggregate records of a number of Queensland firms. These costs include the introduction of the second tier wage increase, 4 per cent; superannuation, 3 per cent; shorter hours-the 38-hour week, which came into existence in Queensland only last year or the year before-5 per cent; and training tax, one per cent. That gives a total cost of 13 per cent. If we combine these costs with the extra costs for labour, as a consequence of the present award system, it represents a total increase in costs of about 22 per cent to 23 per cent-and one firm had even estimated an increase of 25 per cent. Despite the benefits that the present system has promised to return, it continues to generate large labour cost increases that are economically unsustainable.
      </para>
      <para>
       In other words, we have given benefits beyond the capacity of industry to pay. That is why we are seeing so many bankruptcies. No industry can take the imposition of extra costs in today's poor economic times and then cop the reductions in tariffs that have just been introduced. It is impossible, it cannot happen and the results will be that many companies will go offshore. The people who welcome our blind faith in a reduced tariff policy are our competitors, who rush in and use Australia as a dumping ground for many of their varied products. To drop tariffs without getting productivity increases is suicide. There are specific industries in overseas countries that throw in an extra production run to dump on the Australian market. We find viable, efficient Australian industries suddenly forced to direct their resources, energy and money to establish anti-dumping cases.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was with pleasure that I was able to move the motion that ensured that the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology would investigate the suitability of the present anti-dumping regime. Anti-dumping procedures are allowable under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If we are determined to lead the way in an anti-subsidy war, we should at least be looking at GATT-legal ways to save some of our industries from falling victim to unfair competition from overseas companies.

       It is interesting that this Government has brought down an industry statement called Building a Competitive Australia  while at the same time our greatest industries, the rural industries on which Australia has maintained its wealth, are struggling from the imposition of destructive Government policies. At this very moment our good old reliable wheat industry, on which Australia has prospered since its inception, is in the position where plantings will be reduced by 35 per cent this year because it will not be able to get any Government support. Six million tonnes of wheat will be lost from these reduced plantings. At a time of fierce and unfair competition from the United States of America and the European Community, Australia, because of this shortfall, will lose existing markets to these very same competitors. Wheat farmers must have enough resources available to them to enable the industry to keep up its supply level when essentially the world market is in a state of low supply.

       The plea for compensation for losses arising from the trade sanctions against Iraq, estimated at $315m, is still there. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised this Parliament that the burden of the Iraqi war would fall equally on all Australians. But it has not; it has fallen firmly on the wheat farmers of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The thrust of the statement is directed at encouraging exports. Our traditional export industries must not be left to wither on the vine because of hope and unrealised fervour for potentially successful secondary industries. Across the whole range of primary industries trade promotion should be attacked in an aggressive manner. Australian farmers produce quality products in the most internationally effective manner. In the context of Australian industry, primary production is a winner but no industry, no matter how efficient, can compete against odds such as are determined by a war between the two biggest producers in the world.

       The Prime Minister spoke on Tuesday of meeting the challenges of international competition. There is no international competition when our competitors do not compete fairly or do not even play on the same ground. There is no challenge in a marketplace that is absolutely corrupt. The desperate plight of rural Australians received a cursory acknowledgment in Tuesday's statement. The Prime Minister said that rural Australia in particular is experiencing a very tough time. I say to the Prime Minister that it is more than that. There is such an interdependence in rural areas that activities that have never been on the verge of collapse have reached that point.

       Small business in the country is in an even more desperate plight than urban small business. Small business has such a capacity to employ Australians that it is vital it is not forgotten in any industry plan. Unfortunately, small business did not even get a guernsey yesterday. It was mentioned, and when it became too hard it was dropped altogether. The Government should at least accelerate its investigation and implementation of the Beddall report, which was tabled in the other place 10 months ago but has not seen the light of day in here as yet.

       The announcement in the statement that there will be a reduction in general agricultural tariffs is an about-face for the sugar industry. The sugar industry since May 1989 has gone through massive changes in its contribution to industry deregulation. The industry is a major export earner for Australia, with 80 per cent of its yield being exported. The raw sugar industry was awaiting the terms of reference from the Industry Commission for an inquiry into sugar, which included the tariffs, when the new reduced tariff regime was suddenly imposed on the industry without notice on Tuesday.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government, when lifting the embargo on the importation of sugar which took effect on 30 June 1989, established a tariff regime. Following a Senate inquiry, the tariffs were set at $115 a tonne for two years, reducing to $95 a tonne from 1 July 1991, with a further reduction to $70 a tonne from 1 July 1992. As of Tuesday, the tariff will be reduced from $95 to $76 from 1 July 1991, and is to be further reduced on 1 July 1992 from the scheduled $70 a tonne to $55 a tonne. Surely the industry had a right to expect that the tariff would not be changed prior to the planned Industry Commission inquiry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The immediate cost to the industry of the tariff reductions will be $16m a year. That will amount to a loss in Australian export earnings. The determination of the existing tariff system followed extensive input from industry. Senator Childs will remember going all over Australia taking evidence not only from industry and farmers but also from the many unionists who put submissions before that inquiry. Not only did the farmers and the industry have the right to expect the findings of that inquiry to be implemented and held to, but the Government has ripped that up. It is not only attacking the farmers; it is also attacking every worker employed in the sugar industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is only another example, if another example is needed, of this Government making commitments and then breaking them. If we want to see evidence of that let us refer to the wool industry. Mr Kerin promised on 11 occasions that the 700c price would remain firm and then, at some whim, walked away from the industry. The inquiry is taken seriously. The statement has the result of changing an established and certain system midstream and requires some announcement from Government as to its real intentions and bona fides for the forthcoming industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proper direction for all industry that was required from this statement was really not forthcoming. With submissions from industry groups and disclosures in the media during the devising of the statement, the Government was being given plenty of good, practical advice on what industry in Australia needed. The good advice was ignored. Industry said, `No further tariff cuts without meaningful micro-economic reform that will enable us to be more competitive and meet the competition from imports'. Small business said, `Consider the contribution we can make to the Australian economy and work force', but was totally ignored. Of course, rural industry was barely acknowledged, other than its present organisational structures-that is, the statutory marketing authorities-being threatened by trade practices legislation references, and simply equating the rural tariff levels with manufacturing tariff levels. They are two totally different industries with rural industry already out there fully exposed to the vagaries of world market prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a sorry state when our great rural industry is pleased to hear that in April the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will announce a rural adjustment program that will ensure farmers most in need during the current rural crisis will receive appropriate assistance. That is not very complimentary to our rural industry. It had a right to be included in this statement and it was rejected. The statement is a disappointment. It follows on the disastrous Government approach of applying theory without reference to realities and practicalities. Therefore, there is the great fear that the effect of this statement, coupled with the inappropriate policies of high interest rates, will only lead to the further rapid decline of Australian industries. Now that the Government has given us a policy for industry, it must ensure that the Australian industry is successful and is ready to go.

      <para>
       In conclusion, I believe that the Government must not only tell Australian industry that it must work smarter and be competitive; it also has to be honest with the worker, it has to take the worker into its confidence. We are out in the international pool where there is no protection. We are a small country with 17 million people and that is a disadvantage in manufacturing, because manufacturing in Australia cannot get the massive production runs. We are starting behind the eight ball. The Government must tell the workers that they have to share the responsibilities and pull their weight too. They are in competition now with countries that do not give comparable benefits to their industries. In America, the basic wage is $3.50 an hour. Of course, there are add-ons for skills; there is no four weeks leave; there is no 17 per cent loading, and there is no long service leave. In Japan, industry works 2,000 hours a year; Australian industry works 1,700 hours a year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister should be saying to the workers of Australia and to the unionists, `You have to be competitive too; we have pushed you all-industry and workers-off the deep end. You will either sink or swim'. They cannot rely on one particular sector of an industry. If the workers cannot accept that, then jobs will go and it will not be industry's fault. No matter how much the Australian Council of Trade Unions abuses industry and calls it `wishy washy, uncompetitive, wimps' and all other names that are being used at the moment, industry can play a role. But the workers must play their role, and they must realise that the benefits they have received in the past will not be forthcoming in the future. Australian industry certainly cannot compete against other countries that do not provide the benefits and the costs for their workers. If Australian workers realise that, then hopefully we will be competitive and we will go into the future.

        —We are discussing the Government's statement entitled Building a Competitive Australia. I would like to comment on the needs of the manufacturing industry and the very welcome decisions that are contained in the Government's statement.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Manufacturing is a vital part of the economy. Australia can ill-afford to step away from its problems. Manufacturing accounts for about 16 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 45 per cent of current exports. It comprises the kernel of the nation's technical skills which are vital in primary resource industries as well, and that, in part, answers what Senator Boswell was just asking.
      </para>
      <para>
       No other country of significant size has been able to sustain a high standard of living over a long period without a strong manufacturing base. The trade deficit, which has featured so much in this debate, is significant especially as manufactures amounted to $19.9 billion in 1988-89. A further problem is the composition of Australia's manufactured exports. Of the approximately $20 billion only $4.5 billion has a high value added; in other words, elaborately transformed manufactures-goods such as cars, engines, scientific equipment and components. The remaining manufactured exports of about $16 billion comprise raw materials which have received limited processing; for example, the sugar industry that Senator Boswell was referring to.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other significant reason why I believe it is an important subject and the Government's initiatives are extremely important is that 72 per cent of Australia's imports comprise manufactured goods. Therefore, I welcome the many initiatives that are contained in the statement, particularly the introduction of exemptions from the wholesale sales tax. A simplification of the system will reduce the cost burden in industry. The new exemptions flow from the wholesale sales tax review in the 1990 Budget. Exemptions are extended to include inputs used in manufacturing for research and development design and production processes. Staff training will also be included in the exemptions. So there is a significant raft of proposals which will make it so much easier for industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new depreciation regime will allow manufacturers to claim depreciation on the estimated life over which assets will earn income and provide taxpayers with greater certainty. The example of 125 per cent research and development deduction is a particularly welcome initiative. Research and development is one area where we have to move from such a very low base, especially in the private sector. Private sector research and development is only 0.5 per cent of GDP. That is a very poor performance over many years. The 125 per cent deduction will be retained as a permanent feature of the tax system. It means that we can expect private industry to have a certainty about that proposal. When it is linked with the Government's training levy-in other words, the training of staff and the pressure on people to develop their skilled staff, their scientific staff, instead of pinching them from somebody else-we will have a regime that offers great possibilities for us in the future in the vital area of research and development for industry development.
      </para>
      <para>
       The enhancement of the capital base of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation is an example of the very appropriate and excellent intervention by the Government in industry to promote exports. This is what the statement Building a Competitive Australia is all about.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other financial service companies have shown that they are not prepared to accept the risks in securing long term access to export markets. That is part of an Australian problem that has so often been identified where people want very quickly to get returns on their capital. The support for trade and credit insurance is essential in view of the strategic support provided by other governments to support their own exports in securing overseas markets. It is encouraging that the Government is prepared to provide $200m callable capital to a successful and essential government business enterprise.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is to introduce an advanced manufacturing technology strategy to encourage the development, production and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. I welcome the Government's action and, in particular, the decision to maintain and extend the bounty scheme for production of machine tools and robots with effect from 1 July 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       The bounty will be extended to cover equipment used in processing advanced materials such as ceramics, carbon fibre and composite materials. This recognises the importance of such materials as alternatives to metal in internationally competitive products and will cater for advances in materials processing technology. The treatment of machines for working of advanced materials will be made consistent with that for metal working machines and robots. To do this duty free by law entry will be extended on a case by case basis to imports, allowing end users access to the latest equipment at world prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       The decisions in this area reflect the Government's view that the bounty will continue to be an important factor in maintaining a key industrial capacity with an important role in the diffusion of advanced manufacturing technologies. The use of advanced manufacturing technology is very significant because it makes a real contribution to efficiency, productive skills enhancement, employee well-being and the general competitiveness of manufacturing industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will introduce a program to assist leading edge customers of advanced manufacturing technology to work more closely with local suppliers and relevant research organisations to develop products and services to meet their needs. The strengthening of core strategic capacities within the Australian advanced manufacturing technology supply sector and the joint development of more indigenous products and services will greatly assist change and improvement in our manufacturing base.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to turn to another aspect of this issue which does not involve a great amount of money but I think it is an important development; that is, the extension of the Australian Quality Awards. Achievement of quality is important for international competitiveness and the Government places priority on businesses achieving international standards of quality in products. Enterprise Australia has organised Australian Quality Awards for the past three years. In 1990 the Government provided $50,000 to fund the awards. Reflecting its initial success, the program is to be substantially upgraded so that the awards recognise outstanding achievement, involve more companies, encourage greater commitment by companies to organisation-wide quality improvement, establish an evaluation process and provide performance benchmarks of international standing.
      </para>
      <para>
       I mention this because in the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology report entitled Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation: Making it Together, we acknowledged the work of Work Skill Australia which, in 1982, created national work skill competitions. Senator Brownhill is here in the chamber, and he has been one of the people instrumental in promoting the Work Skill Olympics and other aspects of giving credit to people skilled in industry. One of our recommendations was that the Skill Olympics should receive greater public recognition for our winners in this area in exactly the same way as we honour sports men and women. I mention that because the Quality Awards are a move in the same direction.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many people do not acknowledge that it is very important to have successful models in every sphere of activity; no less than in manufacturing industry which for so long has had an attitude problem. People have seen manufacturing industry as not being as attractive as white collar and other types of industry and commerce-a whole of range of industries that are seen to be more attractive. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in his industry statement:
      </para>
      <para>
       The challenge is therefore to make decisions and adopt the practices and attitudes which will enable this and succeeding generations to achieve those basic goals.
      </para>
      <para>
       In a moment I would like to outline the proposals that address this challenge in a report on new management techniques in manufacturing industry of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. This report put great emphasis on the people side of the manufacturing process; the sort of thing that has been referred to in the Prime Minister's statement as `working for a clever country'. It is the emphasis in this area that will be the basis of success in our manufactures. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       <para>
        PARLIAMENTARY INFORMATION SYSTEM `UNOFFICIAL ACCOUNT'
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President,
       </para>
       <para>
        I present the 308th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts-the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) `Unofficial Account'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's task in this Inquiry was to examine the roles and responsibilities of the key players in the establishment and operation of the `unofficial account' and to assess what further action was required in response to the breaches identified in the report of the Auditor-General. Chapter 8 of the Report summarises the Committee's findings in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The term `unofficial account' has been used throughout the report and the Committee emphasises that the account was clearly illegal. It was set up and operated by a small number of individuals within the Parliamentary Information Systems Office. The Committee considers it likely, because of the extremely unusual nature of the account, that if it had not been for the actions of certain other individuals, the account would have remained undetected for a considerable period. In fact, it may never have been discovered.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the question of possible disciplinary action against those connected with the `unofficial account', the Committee notes that this responsibility rests solely with the relevant delegates under the Public Service Act 1922. In the Committee's view, consideration of such action will need to take account of the advice of the Attorney-General's Department in relation to the breaches identified by the Auditor-General, as well as the findings of the Public Accounts Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee draws attention to the fact that although it is concerned with issues of accountability, consistent with its charter, this Inquiry differed significantly from the Committee's usual inquiries in that the terms of reference called for an assessment of specific individuals' roles and responsibilities with regard to the `unofficial account'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee wishes to emphasise that, while its evidence is taken on oath or affirmation, the Committee is not a court of law. Nevertheless, at all times during the Inquiry, the Committee attempted to ensure that the principles of natural justice prevailed. Witnesses were given every right of reply to allegations made against them. Ultimately, however, where there was a conflict in the evidence before the Committee, the Committee was required to make a judgement about whose evidence to believe and has done so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has concluded that poor management within both the Parliamentary Library and PISO, together with the lack of effective accountability mechanisms in a situation of devolved responsibility, created the environment which enabled the `unofficial account' to be set up in the first place and remain undetected for so long.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was shocked to discover that, at the time of the events under review, there was no internal audit function within the Department of the Parliamentary Library nor, indeed, in any of the Parliamentary Departments. In the Committee's view, internal audit is a fundamental link in the chain of accountability. The Committee has recommended, therefore, that each Parliamentary Department that has not already done so should establish, as a matter of priority, an adequately resourced internal audit function.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inquiry has also demonstrated the need for all new entrants to the Australian Public Service to be briefed on the financial legal framework affecting public servants' dealings with Commonwealth financial resources and the Committee has made a recommendation accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Government examine ways to ensure that its major contractors comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation and operating policies which impinge on contracts.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, these last two recommendations in no way relieve senior public servants or contractors to the Commonwealth of their responsibility to be aware of, and comply with, relevant laws and regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has also recommended that the Department of Administrative Services review the guidelines and procedures regarding the disposal of surplus, unserviceable or obsolete assets to ensure that the arrangements currently in place are adequate, clearly understood and properly implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee emphasises that while the sum involved in this investigation-a total of $88,100-may not be significant in terms of total Commonwealth outlays, the principles involved are significant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, the Committee believes that its investigation has proved to be a salutary reminder not only to officers of PISO, but to all Commonwealth public servants of the responsibilities involved in managing and accounting for the taxpayer's dollar.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Committee notes that in February 1990 the Presiding Officers transferred PISO to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and that since that time substantial measures have been taken to improve the management and accountability of PISO within this new Departmental structure. The Committee is satisfied that the serious shortcomings it had identified in this area have now been properly addressed.

       The Pappas Carter report commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Council, and recent publications by EPAC, have placed particular emphasis on the importance of changing the workplace culture. In cooperation with the AMC, we will develop a program to raise the efficiency of Australian enterprises to world standards. We will draw on the experience of our own world class companies together with the best practices that can be found anywhere in the world in this endeavour.
      </para>
      <para>
       This attempt to have world class companies has proved very elusive because until now Australia has not had enough companies that could properly be classified as world class. It is significant to note that the Government has appointed Mr John Prescott, the Managing Director of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) and Chairman of the Australian Manufacturing Council, to chair the board that will oversee the new program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Historically, BHP had a very bad reputation in industrial relations and its general relationships with its staff. It is significant that that has changed dramatically over the past few years. Despite a bad record, as far as I am concerned, BHP has adopted new management techniques which have brought it into the twentieth century and which now mean that many BHP plants are an example for other Australian companies to follow. I welcome the fact that this new program will have $25m spent on it over two years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Boswell, when he was referring to the costs faced by businesses in Queensland, failed to mention whether management is using modern techniques or doing what BHP did for many years and merely giving instructions and orders to people and wondering why its work force was so passive and resentful. Such businesses have missed out on all the innovation and creativeness that have become characteristic of countries that are successful manufacturers, such as Germany, Japan and, of course, Sweden.
      </para>
      <para>
       I welcome the Government initiatives to develop the human capital in our manufacturing industry. Although the Government has done many things to help industry become more efficient, the significant reference to Australia becoming the clever country becomes operative only when people are taken into the process through commitment and cooperation and through the shared commitment to agreed goals that have been worked out by people participating in a more democratic process, which can build on the strong foundation the Government has created through award restructuring and the other techniques that have been brought in to try to improve our way of doing things.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology produced a report, which the Government has not yet responded to. I find the Government's tardiness in replying somewhat irritating, although I appreciate that the Government is dealing with reports that have been tabled in both Houses on ways of improving manufacturing industry. As the Government has not yet responded, I commend to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) a consideration, in following through the initiatives in the industry statement, of the proposals contained in the report New Management Techniques in Manufacturing Industry. People and Technology. The emphasis in the report is on people and technology being the secret of success in manufacturing.
      </para>
      <para>
       The significance of the report is that it proposes the creation of advanced manufacturing technology in Australia based on examples of efficiency in other countries. It recommends that an Australian model be established with uniquely Australian characteristics. For example, Australia is one of the few countries that have so many different languages in its factories, workplaces and industry generally.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should like to comment specifically on the proposal by the Committee for the development of an Australian model for new management techniques. That will be the principal outcome of a series of national conferences which will serve to raise the awareness of new management techniques referred to in the Prime Minister's statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The model would be developed over successive conferences as experience and knowledge of relevant factors increased. The Committee recommended that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce use the recommendations and comments in the report entitled People and Technology as the basis for developing a draft model for consideration at the proposed conferences. The report says:
      </para>
      <para>
       Development of that draft model should take place following consultation with bodies such as the AMC and NIES. The draft model should form the basis for separate industry models which would clarify the terminology, specify performance indicators and enable the identification of businesses able to meet the standards of that model.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is very important in this discussion about modernising industry to realise that there are no agreed definitions at this stage of what constitutes the world-class manufacturing organisation. In addition to the national conferences, it was proposed that there be complementary State conferences.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee also recommended that the first national conference cover such matters as the development of an Australian model for new management techniques; development of working groups to discuss experiences with new management techniques; the education system's ability to train the work force; reports by consultants, including case studies; international industry experience, including guest speakers and case studies; and industry sector forecasts and trends. Here there was an attempt to follow the very successful forecasting that occurs in primary industry at a national conference. The parallel is significant: if we are to redress the problems we have in manufacturing, then we need the same sort of intelligence, but we also need the discussion and participation of the players from industry in looking at the future of the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is particularly important in conjunction with the Government's statement because we do have to change the whole of Australian industry culture so that people will be more interested in, and see the importance of, Australia having successful industry. There is only one way to achieve that: to have a proper democratic public debate about those issues. Unfortunately, that debate does not take place in Australia in a concerted way at the moment. It often occurs only in a negative way. Unfortunately, so many contributions from the Opposition have contributed to that negative debate that does take place in our society instead of the sort of thing that I would see taking place in that national conference on industry. Of course, one of the significant points that we would finally be looking at in such a meeting would be the strategies for developing overseas markets in conjunction and consultation with Austrade.
      </para>
      <para>
       My final point is that it was proposed that that conference take place with the minimum number of peak organisations, the primary emphasis being on the participants from management and labour so that we did have the people who are experiencing these new management techniques that were referred to in the Prime Minister's report being the dominant people. The people going to that national conference will increase the community awareness of these techniques so that we can get that attitude change referred to in the statements by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button.
      </para>
      <para>
       I commend the Government's statement. I think that there are many very satisfactory developments. I think that for too long there has not been a discussion about the strategy that Australian manufacturing industry, in particular, should follow. I hope that, together with the Government accepting the concept of a national conference to highlight industry issues, the Government's statement will help Australian industry to become export oriented, to engage in import replacement and generally to have a more powerful presence in the world. I commend the statement to the Senate.

        —The Government's industry statement, under the pretentious title Building a Competitive Australia, delivered in this place only two days ago on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the accompanying statement by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), was widely touted for weeks before the event as this Hawke Government's last chance.

        —Its last chance, as Senator Brownhill says, it certainly was. It was touted as the Government's last chance to bring this destructive recession to an end; its last chance to build a competitive Australian economy; its last chance to give the Australian people some hope; and its last chance to salvage some political credibility. It has missed every one of those chances. It has wasted the chance to initiate and accelerate the real reforms-the structural reforms-which the Australian economy so desperately needs. Why? `It is not easy to introduce micro-economic reform quickly, when the Government naturally had to represent union interests'. They are not my words. Those words are reported as being stated by none other than the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin. They bear repeating: `It is not easy to introduce micro-economic reform quickly, when the Government naturally had to represent union interests'.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Government's cover has been blown by this Minister. Despite all the rhetoric, this is a government which claims at best to represent about 30 per cent of the Australian work force in the private sector-those in trade unions; and a somewhat higher number in the public sector-those who make up the new class. These words reinforce that this Government remains the creature of, and is beholden to, the trade union movement.
      </para>
      <para>
       No wonder the Australian Council of Trade Unions has been given de facto Cabinet status under this Hawke Labor Government. No wonder the statements two days ago were heavy on rhetoric and very short on action. All failed to come to grips with the real crisis on our doorsteps. No wonder each failed to produce real strategies to battle inflation and unemployment and to bolster production, exports and import replacement. No wonder each failed to provide answers to reduce our foreign debt. This Government has, in restating its agenda for growth and reform, simply reinforced that both this country and its economy are completely off the rails. This industry statement is a superb yardstick for the Government's failures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Who can possibly believe anything that this Labor Government says? Here we are on the verge of economic collapse and this Government holds up a bunch of unpalatable carrots. Even one of its own, the South Australian Premier and National Labor Party President, John Bannon, has come out and criticised this statement. He has criticised his own Party-his own Government, in effect-by saying that, if the economy did not recover later this year, as forecast in the statement, manufacturing industry would be left in a vulnerable state with further job losses in some sections of the industry. Amongst its many other critics, even this Labor Party Premier has criticised the Government for failing to have the guts to tackle the issues head on. In fact, a range of quite diverse groups have given quite negative responses to the statement. From the welfare sector through to a range of industry groups there has been a similar response. It is all a phoney, put-up job, lacking substance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Button and the Prime Minister have delivered nothing but a bland recipe for more of the same: no labour market reform; no acceleration of waterfront reform; no abolition of cabotage to give us competitive coastal shipping or to get rid of the trans-Tasman restrictive arrangements dictated by the unions; no privatisation; no genuine reform of taxation; no reduction in the centralised bureaucracy-nothing.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government has the gall to come into this chamber and tell us that it has the solution to meet the economic challenges facing this country; but it has offered no real solutions. It has done nothing but fail spectacularly and miserably on all fronts. We heard on Tuesday from the third of the triumvirate, Industrial Relations Minister Cook, that we need to rejuvenate the economy and make it more productive; that we need to pull together. He would even have us believe that this Government is instrumental in having us do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       If this industry statement reflects a carefully planned and phased reform program, as he claimed it did, then I say we are in for much bigger trouble than we have already had. The Minister applauds his Government's actions in handing over $2m through the rationalisation process. That is on top of the generous handouts already earmarked for the retirement of watersiders across the country, on top of the already excessive greed of transport unions. He talks about the $25m for the Australian best practice demonstration program and the $20m for workplace reform programs, as though in merely handing out money problems are solved and strategies for change are in place.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Minister, with misplaced confidence that the process will produce a catalytic effect of change will, fortunately, not be a Minister after the next election and be able to boast of any success. The Minister talks about no longer accepting that workers should leave their brains at the factory gate. We in the Liberal and National parties have never thought like that. So it is the Labor Party that has had to change its way of thinking with regard to workers. Contrary to the Minister's comments, this statement explains nothing to Australian taxpayers but how this Government will finally empty the larder.
      </para>
      <para>
       This country's dilemma is not one of success but a question of national inadequacy, of a desperate need to adapt to a rapidly changing world. Professor Peter Drucker, in The Changed World Economy, could not have put it better, and I quote from that book:
      </para>
      <para>
       From now on any country-but also any business . . . that wants to prosper, will have to accept that it is the world economy that leads and that domestic economic policies will succeed only if they strengthen, or at least do not impair, the country's international competitive position. This may be the most important-it surely is the most striking-feature of the changed world economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian firms which generate incomes and wealth for this country are restrained by a whole range of policies and manmade institutional arrangements which this Government strictly controls. We have to diversify our export base and take risks in growing markets, like the manufacturing areas of technology. If we do not adapt and conquer these and other areas of change, then we will have to content ourselves with a reduced rate of growth and an impoverished standard of living.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why does the Government have to wait until it has got us into the worst recession since the Second World War before it feebly attempts to inject some life into the economy? Clearly, it is a case of too little, too late. That this Prime Minister's meagre plan is too little, too late, is confirmed by the fact that it represents about one-eleventh of the urgently needed reform identified by the Business Council of Australia as crucial to national productivity improvement. Without the rest, it will be impossible to reduce our foreign debt and keep our standard of living from falling even further. If the Government had the guts to implement the whole package of reforms identified by the Opposition as necessary, and which we are committed to introducing, then Australian companies would be able to lift their productivity to world best levels and national income would explode by a similar amount over the coming decade.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, it is quite clear that we are operating below our world best potential. We have a strong store of human resources but we make poor use of them. High labour turnover, absenteeism and an unwillingness to use labour saving technology, combined with management that has failed to adopt the superior quality and service control practices of most other developed countries, have seriously eroded Australia's international competitiveness. In a ranking of 22 countries in the 1990 World Competitiveness Report, published by the World Economic Forum and the International Institute for Management Development, Australia is well below average in every factor, save for human resources and natural endowments. In the other eight areas we rank within the bottom 45 per cent. These include socio-political stability-no doubt as a result of the incompetence of this present Government-innovative forward orientation, State interference, market orientation, dynamism of the economy, financial dynamism, industrial efficiency and outward orientation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The initiatives announced by the Government will be ineffective and meaningless without total structural reform. Provided each area is tackled simultaneously, reform and revitalisation will take place. Industry will become more efficient and more internationally competitive. Our physical proximity to the newly and rapidly industrialising countries of South East Asia, such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand-rather than to the markets of Europe and North America-gives us opportunities, provided we can meet the needs of customers in the region. But we are competing against the successful Asian countries-Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong-and our efforts to date in increasing the focus on Asian markets have not been sufficient to prevent our share of the value of world exports from falling.
      </para>
      <para>
       We do not have a low wage structure, so to compete we must attain high productivity and quality levels. Our standards of quality and service are below average. Even our best performance is barely above the average levels in other countries and is approximately the same as the worst Japanese performer. There is no longer any safety net for industry. The message cannot be made any clearer: we must simply improve productivity. It is no good saying that we have come a long way in the last 20 years, because our competitors are improving too. Indeed, other nations are improving a lot faster than we are, so that critical gap is widening.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent Industry Commission figures indicate that even limited improved efficiency in transport and communications and the public sector provision of services could add as much as $18 billion to our gross domestic product each year, and with reduced protection adding a further $4 billion, that makes an extra national income of $22 billion per year. That equates to about $2,300 per household, 53,000 additional jobs, a 7 per cent reduction in the cost of living, or a real wage increase in excess of 9 per cent. None of these figures takes into account the possible effects of comprehensive industrial relations reform or the introduction of a goods and services tax, which will both be the top priorities for the next coalition government. But the Government simply ignores the need to get on with all of this.
      </para>
      <para>
       Central to the Government's statement is much rhetoric about the Government's success in winding down import protection for manufacturers and announcements to accelerate that process generally, particularly with regard to textiles, clothing and footwear, and the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. As a result of those decisions, the Australian newspaper columnist Paul Kelly wrote in this morning's edition:
      </para>
      <para>
       The protection debate in Australia is dead-for companies, industries and politicians. The days of arguing for protection-the biggest game in Canberra-are gone.
      </para>
      <para>
       In similar vein, earlier this evening at the annual dinner of the Society of Modest Members, I heard this week described as the Bert Kelly Memorial Week. However, when one looks at the announcements in detail, one has to question whether that statement by Paul Kelly, or indeed the claim for this week to be Bert Kelly Memorial Week, is quite the case.
      </para>
      <para>
       The announcements involve general levels of tariff reduction from 10 per cent and 15 per cent to 5 per cent between 1992 and 1996, while for textiles, clothing and footwear it will come down from the present massive levels to between 15 per cent and 25 per cent by the year 2000, and for passenger motor vehicles to 15 per cent. This is too little, too late, too slow and too unbalanced. It is too little because, as Professor Garnaut and others have clearly demonstrated, the benefits to Australians of reducing tariffs to zero by the year 2000 are considerable. We should also remember that the Industry Commission in its draft report on the motor vehicle industry recommended a phasing down of tariffs more quickly to a zero level by the year 2000. In its final report it slackened that off to 15 per cent, which the Government has accepted. That perhaps indicates that the debate has not quite yet been won. That is why the Liberal and National parties have taken the policy initiative to reduce all industry protection to negligible levels by the year 2000. It is only when that policy is implemented that we will be really able to celebrate Bert Kelly Memorial Week. I certainly hope he is here to see that.
      </para>
      <para>
       The initiatives are too late as well as being too little, because a more determined attack on protection should have commenced earlier. The initiatives are too slow because the rate of reductions each year should be greater to achieve negligible levels of protection, as I have said, by the year 2000. The statement is unbalanced because it completely ignores the need for structural reform in our economy. Need I repeat it yet again: there is need for reform in the labour market, in all the transport sectors, on the waterfront and in government business enterprises. There is the need for these initiatives to accompany reduced protection so that our industries can compete without protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Government's failure to act in these key areas does not provide a valid argument against reducing tariffs. Reducing protection on its own provides net benefits to Australians, even if all other things remain equal. It should ensure that a wider range of goods and services is available to consumers and, more importantly, that they are available at lower prices. It should also ensure that resources of capital and labour are employed in those types of businesses where we are actually efficient and internationally competitive, even allowing for our structural disadvantages, and therefore resources will be allocated to those areas where we can create real wealth through the generation of export income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Moreover, reducing protection without accompanying structural reform will not make it impossible for Australian manufacturers to compete against imports. Failure to achieve the much needed structural reform will simply mean that the Australian economy remains weak and hence the Australian dollar will continue to fall in value against overseas currencies, as it has for the eight years of Hawke Labor Government economic mismanagement. The only exception to this has been during the period when the Government wrong-headedly enforced high interest rates which in turn attracted hot money into Australia and artificially kept our currency higher than justified by our real economic situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the absence of structural reform, this slide in our dollar's value will continue and more than offset the reduced protection initiated by this statement, even in the case of textiles, clothing and footwear, and motor vehicles. By way of example, over the last seven years the landed cost in Australia of a representative sample of cars imported from Japan and Germany has increased by only 18 per cent in yen and deutschmark currencies respectively. But in Australian dollars, the increase has been a massive 166 per cent, so great has been the depreciation of our currency. This massive increase in landed cost, as a direct result of our currency poor international standing, has much more than offset any reductions in protection designed to make imports more competitive against locally manufactured vehicles. Our currency will continue its slide into oblivion under this Government's policies. That is why the Government should be going all the way in reducing protection to negligible levels by the year 2000, as advocated by the Opposition.
      </para>
      <para>
       The real tragedy in this statement is for the Australian people, more than for Australian industry. It is our people who will suffer from this too little, too late policy of reducing protection by having to pay higher prices than necessary for goods and services; whereas industry, as I have shown, because of our continuing currency devaluation, would not have suffered from a more rapid reduction in protection. It is our people who will suffer from the failure of this Hawke Labor Government to initiate by this statement much needed structural reform in our economy, the so-called micro-economic reform. This failure condemns our economy to continue its poor performance and low levels of productivity. This means that, even if people are able to extract wage increases, in real terms everyone will be poorer because in real terms everything-goods and services, locally manufactured or imported-will be dearer. So everyone will be able to buy less and will be condemned to a lower standard of living. It is this, rather than reduced protection, which has the capacity to destroy local manufacturers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The real threat to Australian manufacturers is the ever-diminishing demand for their products because Australians, in real terms, are becoming poorer and poorer, and unable to buy them. This statement, because it fails absolutely to initiate structural reform, offers no hope to Australians for a more productive, more prosperous and brighter future. Instead, at least until a coalition Government is elected to take those initiatives and change things dramatically, it condemns Australia to becoming the poor, white trash of Asia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another initiative in this statement which is too little, too late is the reduction in the so-called luxury car tax, introduced nearly a year ago. This initiative was nothing more than a politics-of-envy, soak-the-rich sop to Labor's Left in the lead up to the last election, without any regard to practical policy formulation. It represented a classic case of the static analysis of tax changes, completely ignoring the dynamic effect of such changes. When the legislation was debated last May, I warned the Government that, quite apart from its other shortcomings, it would not result in the extra $100m revenue for roads, which was its claimed purpose, and that it would more likely cause a loss of revenue. But the Government thought it knew better. It thought that the massive increase in prices engendered by a discriminatory sales tax of 50 per cent would not significantly affect sales. It was horribly wrong and I was absolutely right.
      </para>
      <para>
       Partly as a result of the recession, but largely as a result of this tax, sales of cars subject to the tax plummeted from an annual rate of 15,000 in 1989 to less than 5,000 annual rate in the last half of 1990. Whereas that earlier lower tax regime raised $450m in revenue in 1988-89, instead of the expected $550m for 1990-91, about $225m would have been raised if this tax had continued-about half that earlier generated by the lower rate of tax. The extra $100m was really pie in the sky. The Government claims that reducing the tax, as it has now done, to a still discriminatory level of 30 per cent will cost $15m this financial year and $45m in a full year. I very much doubt this. Again, a static view is being taken.
      </para>
      <para>
       Undoubtedly, sales will improve as a result of the price reductions because of the reduction in tax, just as they and revenue fell because of the extra impact of the luxury tax. It is therefore more than likely that there will be a net gain in revenue as a result of this change. But more change is needed in this area. There is no justification for any continuation of a discriminatory tax regime. If a sales tax level of 20 per cent is appropriate for most cars, then it is for all. What is really needed is the abolition of sales tax and its replacement with a broad based goods and services tax. Then cars would bear only their fair share of taxation rather than bearing some 17 per cent of the total Government tax take, as is the case at present. Only then will Australia get a first class export-oriented local car industry capable of matching best international practice, which the Government has set as a goal for this statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       For some years now the Opposition has been calling for extensive micro-economic reform to revitalise the Australian economy, along with major tax reform and the reduction of industry protection to negligible levels by the year 2000. There is no indication in this statement that we are likely to achieve any of that. The statement provides no strategies which would address the severity of our position in a world economy. Finally, no explanation is offered about how we have learned from our past mistakes. Australia cannot afford to wait any longer for these reforms. But sadly, this Government's statement reaffirms that Australia will have to wait for the election of a coalition Government to get any decent reform.

        —This evening the Senate is debating the statement put down during the week by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and Senator Button, Building a Competitive Australia. Unfortunately, I believe that instead of bringing down a statement to turn this country around we have had rather a mishmash of back downs and bandaid situations for the future. The industry that is hurting most in Australia at the present moment is, of course, the rural industry. The Prime Minister did address that point in his delivery to the House of Representatives but laid all the blame on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade situation, the GATT war, the United States export enhancement program, and subsidisation of its products.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I realise that that is the situation. But, unfortunately, those rural industries need immediate help as well as long term help by more pressure being put on the GATT round when it comes around again, and, indeed, all the time, as has happened with the delegation to the United States of America only last week. It is now actively continuing in the Middle East. While I agree that we have to do more and be a stronger force in GATT, I also think we need some measures that will work a lot quicker.

       Senator Chapman has already spoken about the statement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). In April he will bring out a statement about how the rural industry will be assisted. It will work through the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation of Western Australia, Rafcor. Money will be sent to the farmers most in need. I agree that the ones most in need should be helped. I would like to make two points. First, April is too late, especially for the wheat growing industry in the northern parts of Australia. In many places seeding is taking place. If it is not taking place the planning will be. Fertilisers, chemicals and labour-all that sort of thing-have to be put in place. So April is too late.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian reported a statement made by Mr Kerin. I was very surprised that he made such a statement. I rang his office and the office of the Australian to find the exact source of the article. I give Mr Kerin the benefit of the doubt. He may not have been reported completely accurately. But if it has not been reported as he said it, I wish he would come out and say so. This article is dated 13 March 1991. I will read out the piece that annoyed both me and the rest of rural Australia. Mr Kerin said:

       Kerin defends decision on wheat submission
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has hit back at farmers who have accused him of disregarding a Grains Council of Australia plan for a base wheat price of $151 per tonne for next season.
      </para>
      <para>
       His comments followed the Australian Wheat Board's announcement that yesterday's Cabinet decision-involving a watered-down version of the GCA's proposed package-would mean growers receiving a post-harvest payment increase from 30c to up to $6 per tonne.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Kerin told Parliament that Cabinet had examined the GCA plan, which had been included as an annexure to his Cabinet submission on help for the ailing industry, before opting for a solution allowing the AWB to increase its borrowings by $100 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       But Mr Kerin hinted yesterday's decision was not the final response to the wheat industry's problems, saying ``it was necessary to hold the position while moving to a new policy position''.
      </para>
      <para>
       He said farmers had to realise that it was not easy to introduce micro-economic reform quickly in the area of off-farm costs when the Government naturally had to represent union interests.
      </para>
      <para>
       An AWB spokesman said the government decision effectively meant growers would receive money earlier from the 1990-91 wheat pool.
      </para>
      <para>
       ``In very broad terms, that will mean between $5 to $6 a tonne as a national average on Australian standard white post-harvest payment to be made in the third week of March,'' he said.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Kerin also told Parliament that the supplementary payments scheme to wool growers might only cost half the $1 billion predicted by some doomsayers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Kerin said the recent performance of the wool market in the first free market sales in 17 years had defied many gloom and doom predictions-but warned it was too early to make a judgment.

        —I thank the Senate. If that is not what Mr Kerin said, I would like him to say so. I will now move onto other parts of the statement. I will deal with the finer parts. I know that Senator Chapman and others have covered the broad structure of the announcement. I will now move onto resource security as announced both before and in the statement. Resource security, welcome as it may be-I do not believe with the method by which resource security will be put into place-only extends to the timber industry and to a $100m project. What about mining? Mining is doing rather well. It is just as well that it is doing rather well, otherwise Australia would be further behind in our foreign earnings.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Where does the fishing industry stand? This is another good provider of export income. These industries certainly were not mentioned. What is the Government doing about this? I do not agree with the way that resource security will be applied. State governments will have to pass complementary legislation. The green movement is howling from the rooftops at the first mention of resource security. Senator Coulter and Senator Powell were carrying on about it. I commend the Government for doing something, but it must not forget that there are other industries out there that need-I prefer to call it-access to resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       I move on to that part of the statement which talked about the `clever country'. I notice that $15m extra has been allocated to CAP-the country areas program-and for school retention in country areas. I congratulate the Government on the initiative to do as much for the country as it has done for the cities. But it could have gone a lot further.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another aspect is the fringe benefits tax, which will be changed when we are in government. A matter that has been taken up with me in the last few weeks relates to a housemaster in a boarding school who is living on the end of a three storey building with 150 adolescent schoolboys. His quarters are supplied; he has to live in that building, otherwise he does not get the job; he must be in that building 24 hours a day to take care of those children-so why are his quarters taken to be a fringe benefit? I cannot understand that.
      </para>
      <para>
       The school I was talking about has 27 people on its payroll simply looking after boarders. Of course, whatever wages they receive, there is also the 47 per cent on top. Why is that considered a fringe benefit? I believe in a fringe benefits tax when there are definite fringe benefits. But this is totally ridiculous. The Government should look at this. This school that I am talking about and other schools have been doing their bit to postpone collecting the tuition fees. In fact, they have wiped out tuition fees and given people time to pay boarding fees. The schools are doing their bit. As honourable senators from distant areas such as Senator Collins and others know, boarding schools have to be used or else children do not get an education.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now move to the apprentice retention scheme. There has been $74m allocated to this. That is a good idea. But what is the Government doing for apprentices who lost their jobs in the last 12 or 18 months because of the economic downturn? Only the other day I was talking to a young fellow from Adelaide. Unfortunately he is off the payroll. Very little will be done for people like him. I also note that $1.6m has been allocated for 1991-92 only. Once again, what will the Government do once that year has gone?
      </para>
      <para>
       I see that Senator Button hopes to have general tariffs down to 5 per cent by 1996. Passenger motor vehicles are to be reduced to 15 per cent by the year 2000. I welcome this. But I point out to the Senate that primary industries are down to 5 per cent already, or so near it that it does not matter. I believe that Senator Button intends to get it down to 4 per cent in the foreseeable future. Honourable senators can see that primary industries are not treated the same as the manufacturing sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       I move on to another back down by the Government-and that is the wholesale tax on business inputs. Exemptions will be extended on transportation by rail, pipeline and conveyor belt. Once again, I agree with it. It will cost the Government $200m in 1991-92, $375m in 1992-93 and $405m in 1993-94. Why has the Government left road transport out of this? Road transport has to work in areas where there is no railway. And where there are railways it will give the railways an unfair advantage over road. Once again, the Government has not thought it through.
      </para>
      <para>
       I move on to another exemption-the wholesale sales tax on lubricants, office furniture, and equipment. On 23 August 1983 the Government decided to put a sales tax on lubricants. During his second reading speech, Mr Hurford said that the Government proposed to tax oil, greases and lubricants at 23 per cent. He went on to explain that the reason it was going to impose a sales tax on them was that a lot of book work was attached to keeping one sales tax on one industry separate from the sales tax on other industries. The Government wanted to make sure the taxes were paid each year. The Government decided to tax the lot. Now it has backed down and decide to take the tax off. It is a piecemeal situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I can remember a tax being imposed on hand tools used in agriculture in about 1983. That is another area in which this Government has turned around. I have said before that, out there in the community, people need help through these measures now and not down the track. These measures are going to be introduced in the Budget Session and they are going to be put into action when they have received royal assent. I have already said that people out there are hurting. They should not have to wait for the Governor-General's pleasure after we put it through in the Budget Session. I can see another six to nine months gone before any of these measures get through.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now move on to depreciation. It is another area in which the Government introduced a hurried measure and now it has turned around. If I can be so bold, I will quote myself. In this chamber on 7 November 1988, I said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Depreciation changes probably have the greatest effect on primary industry. This Government has been hell-bent on removing any incentives that a succession of coalition governments offered primary industries to keep.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is where I was cut off. Senator Walsh interjected:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is called cleaning up rorts.
      </para>
      <para>
       I retorted that, if we were to return to the practice of writing off over a period as defined in this schedule, it would be more in keeping with the 1950s. It seems to me that the Government is now agreeing with me and my colleagues, as it has reversed this decision also.
      </para>
      <para>
       I welcome the broad-banding of depreciation rates where there is a schedule between 2 1/2 per cent and 33 1/3 per cent, and one fits into one's own slot. I welcome those measures. I also welcome the measure that allows items of $300 or less to be written off immediately and that allows other items to be written off over a life of three years. Of course, the biggest saving in this sector is in accounting fees, where one can put all one's items together if one writes them off at the same rate. So one has got one item on the schedule instead of 33. Of course, it saves a lot in accounting fees.
      </para>
      <para>
       The laws on effective life have been changed. That is a measure that this Government altered in 1983. I also welcome the Taxation Commissioner's ability to give rulings. He may change the assessment if one happens to be in the wrong slot, although it was not mentioned whether there would be penalties.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn to the sales tax on luxury cars, which I termed quite some time ago a jealousy tax. The Government has finally seen its folly. It has admitted that during the last Federal election campaign one of its advisers-I do not think he is an adviser that I would like to see in our campaign at the next election-advised it to put in a measure to appear to be socking the rich. At the same time, it promised to use that $100m to fix up black spots. Fortunately, the Government has seen the folly of its ways, as Senator Chapman pointed out, and pulled that measure out. There is still a 10 per cent luxury car tax. Other cars, below $28,000 wholesale, are taxed at 20 per cent; but a so-called luxury car over $28,000 wholesale will still be charged that 30 per cent, which is still a 10 per cent luxury car tax or jealousy tax or whatever one likes to call it. I remember at that time that the luxury tax, or jealousy tax, extended to four-wheel drives that are used in remote areas. But fortunately the Government did something about it about six months ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       I welcome the changes in anti-dumping measures which shorten the period in which investigations take place. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near short enough. As I have said already, there have, unfortunately, been no changes in the fringe benefits tax. Those remote areas and the small businesses in them have lost out time and time again with this fly in, fly out basis, where men and women leave their families in the city and fly out to their jobs and in a fortnight go home. So very little of the money they earn is spent in those small local businesses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another measure that was retracted-much to the disgust of the Australian Democrats-by this Government was negative gearing. Along with negative gearing and all those measures in this statement which we are debating tonight, it will have to do more as the time comes if we want to turn this country around. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, there is no support for the Grains Council of Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —I rise to give my unequivocal support to the Customs (Rainforest Timber) Amendment Bill 1990 which was introduced by my colleague Senator John Coulter last year. This Bill represents for the first time a plan of action through which Australia can implement a responsible policy on the importation of tropical rainforest timbers and timber products. The Australian Democrats believe that if the Bill is adopted it will have an important demonstration effect on the rest of the world.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The rate of global tropical deforestation and the inadequacies of the existing multilateral institutions to deal effectively with this issue have made it imperative for responsible countries such as Australia to take a leading role now in arresting the destruction of a key part of our global heritage. Australia is uniquely placed to act on this matter since we are among the few developed countries in the world to still have some tropical rainforest areas intact. After losing two-thirds of our original rainforest cover to clearing and logging, Australia has finally moved to protect some of what remains in this country. It is time for us also to encourage the rest of the world to protect what remains of their forest areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        As things stand at the moment, our involvement in the destruction of tropical forests continues beyond our shores. Through our trade, our aid programs and our other links with Asia and the Pacific, Australia plays an important part in the destruction of the world's tropical rainforest areas. Australia imports approximately 200,000 cubic metres of tropical forest timber each year. About 80 per cent is from Malaysia, with the bulk of this from the states of Sarawak and Sabah. Another 10 per cent comes from other South East Asian forests. Although small by world standards, our import trade directly implicates Australia in tropical forest destruction. The world is now estimated to be losing some 20 million hectares of tropical forest each year. This figure equates to an area 18 times the size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground being destroyed each minute, or an area equivalent to the State of Victoria being destroyed each year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Logging in the Asia-Pacific region is largely driven by Western demand for cheap timber. The Democrats believe that the Western world's part in this destruction is quite unacceptable. Tropical timber is under-priced on the world market because of demand for cheap timber from the industrialised world, particularly Japan and the European Community. In some ways it is understandable that the newly industrialised Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) such as the Philippines and Malaysia, in addition to less developed Pacific Island countries, are seeking quick export earnings to aid their development.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the problem is exacerbated by the willingness of less developed countries to accept what is in effect a very low price in order to attract foreign investment and to earn quick export dollars. As Senator Coulter has alluded to, by importing rainforest timbers from unsustainable sources, Australia is in fact exporting environmental damage. There can be no denying that tropical rainforests are one of the most important global environmental assets in the world today, yet the levels of destruction in some ASEAN countries have now reached critical levels. For instance, the Sarawak forests of Malaysia are disappearing at a rate of over 15 million cubic metres per year, while a staggering 80 per cent of the Philippines forest cover has disappeared during the past 30 years. At this rate, all of Sarawak's primary forests and the remaining forest cover in the district of Palawan will be logged within one decade. It is clear that immediate action is necessary if these tropical forests are to be saved from further destruction.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need to remember also that tropical rainforests are the most important habitat for protecting global biodiversity because they contain almost half of all world fauna and flora species. The fact is that these are an irreplaceable part of the world's environment. Permanent conversion of rainforest areas to agricultural land, unsustainable slash and burn agriculture and unsustainable demands for fuel wood fodder and other forest products are the three chief causes of tropical deforestation in the world today.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, this type of logging represents a substantial threat to the tropical forests of the Asia Pacific region. Moreover, there are no examples of commercial logging regimes that have been shown scientifically to be ecologically or environmentally sustainable. Added to this, we have the situation where the current rates of deforestation are estimated to contribute some 2.8 million metric tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere annually in the form of carbon dioxide. Tropical forests store significant quantities of carbon collected in tree trunks as the forest grows. Left alone, the carbon balance is stable. However, forest fires and the felling of trees for timber products release large quantities of carbon into the air.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure I need not remind the Senate that these types of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and other activities are contributing to the earth's greenhouse effect and causing global warming. By supporting this measure to ban the importation of tropical rainforest timber products, Australia will by necessity be helping to create a domestic market for timber and other products which are produced in an environmentally responsible way in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        For instance, one of Australia's chief manufacturing exporting companies, ACI, is currently involved in a fairly new project of exporting a replacement rainforest timber named arakariar from its own plantation areas in the Imbil area near Noosa in Queensland. This is a pale, softwood timber that is perfect for use in housing construction and internal use. I understand that this timber is in fact stronger and more durable than the rainforest timbers which we presently import from Malaysia. This is indeed a real achievement on the part of ACI to be able to produce such a timber from its own plantation areas in Queensland. This type of project must be encouraged.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, apart from the environmental benefits, ACI is an Australian company using Australian workers. In view of our disastrous balance of payments account we are in the situation where we can export a locally made product instead of importing, as we do now. I raise this example to show that this Bill has a great deal of potential to assist Australian industry to engage more positively in the production and export of replacement timber products as some companies are doing at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Naturally, the environmental considerations are vitally important. But the fact is that this country could do far better by encouraging the sort of local production which ACI now engages in with replacement timbers from this plantation area in Queensland. Banning the importation of tropical rainforest timbers and timber products from other nations is one way of achieving that goal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some concern has been expressed that this measure would be in breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) or that somehow it represents an anti-free trading proposal. This is not the case. As the Senate will appreciate, although GATT essentially promotes a liberal international trading regime, there is provision for this sort of trading measure in certain circumstances. For instance, under article 20 of GATT, entitled `General Exceptions', trade measures may be used for:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        In general, therefore, as long as the GATT principles of non-discrimination as laid out in articles 1, 3 and 13 are not violated, trade restrictive measures on a unilateral or bilateral basis such as this are defensible under GATT. Accordingly, we cannot accept any suggestion that action by Australia to restrict imports of tropical timbers would be inconsistent with our obligations under GATT.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the rate of tropical deforestation in ASEAN and Pacific countries, and the inadequacies of existing multilateral institutions such as the International Tropical Timber Organisation to deal with this problem, it is imperative that some international attention be directed in a positive way towards this problem right now. In this regard, consumer countries, albeit small ones such as Australia, have an obligation to take immediate action towards slowing down the wholesale destruction of a vital part of our global heritage by adopting measures such as the one which Senator Coulter has introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the only Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country with at least some of its tropical rainforests left and protected, Australia should be setting an example to other consumer and producer countries alike, otherwise we may well risk being accused of double standards by protecting a small amount of our own few remaining rainforest areas but viewing as acceptable the trade with those Asia-Pacific nations which, at this rate, will have destroyed virtually all of their rainforest areas in another decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, the current importation of rainforest timber products to this country lies at odds with the Government's previously stated desire to protect the few remaining tropical rainforest areas in the world. For instance, in the Government's own publication Our Country, Our Future from July 1989, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's future timber needs should be met, without placing at risk the long term conservation of the rainforest resources of other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats believe it is time to act upon that commitment. We have been intrigued by the Government's desire in recent days to portray itself as committed to making environmentally sensitive decisions. The Democrats suggest that the Government's decisions on the south-eastern forests and, particularly at the moment, on resource security legislation indicate a very shallow commitment indeed to the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under these circumstances it is perfectly understandable that virtually all the major environmental organisations in this country are currently in the process of rejecting the Federal Government precisely because of its poor track record in environment issues. The Government continues to ignore the environment at its own peril. The fact remains that on Australia's doorstep in South East Asia and the South West Pacific is about one-quarter of the world's remaining tropical rainforests. We have an opportunity tonight to do something to protect those remaining forest areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of these tropical forests are threatened right now. The fate of the world's biological diversity depends on our actions. We have only a few years to rescue the situation and, indeed, to save ourselves. Halting the import of tropical timber products is an important step in this process. Australia must demonstrate our good international citizenship by substantiating our verbal commitment to the protection of the world's tropical rainforests and adopting this Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         —The Customs (Rainforest Timber) Amendment Bill being debated tonight, which is Senator Coulter's private member's Bill, has obviously been put forward as a public relations exercise to grab a headline or two and was never intended as a serious Bill. Let me give honourable senators just a short rundown as to why this is so. For some time there has been concern around the world about the likely depletion of tropical forests and the impact on the world that may occur if these forests are not managed correctly.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Recently, three representatives from Sarawak in Malaysia visited Australia, lobbying whoever would listen to them in an attempt to stop their own Government using timber from their State. Obviously, they convinced the Australian Democrats, who are now suggesting that we in this Senate pass a Bill to prohibit the importation into Australia of rainforest timber, not only from their State or indeed their country, the rest of Malaysia-but also from any country which is willing to export these timbers to us.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, how much of these timbers do we in this country actually import? Coopers and Lybrand, in a report commissioned by the Government on this issue, put our total imports of forest products from tropical countries at $340m per annum-or only 16 per cent of our total forest product imports. Of course, only a minor part of these products from tropical countries is rainforest timber.
       </para>
       <para>
        Coopers and Lybrand explained the difficulty in getting separate figures. Japan is the dominant importer of tropical timbers and Australia plays a very minor role in this area. Malaysia is the dominant supplier. Australia takes less than 5 per cent of Malaysia's exports of sawn timber. Of Australia's imports of forest products as a whole, 54 per cent comes from Malaysia. According to the Australian Timber Importers Federation, small quantities of sawn timber mouldings and dowels are imported from Sarawak-but that State is not a supplier of any significance and the great bulk of Australia's imports are from the peninsula of Malaysia, which, according to the International Institute for Environment and Development, has the most complete theoretical system of operational management in South East Asia. Of our timber imports, 14 per cent comes from Taiwan, 11 per cent from Singapore, 9 per cent from Indonesia and 6 per cent from the Philippines.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I am talking about 54 per cent of our timber imports coming from Malaysia, let me point out to the Democrats-and I think it is important to take this into consideration-that the Malaysian Government is very sensitive about suggestions of import bans. Interviewed in August last year, the Malaysian High Commissioner to Australia described allegations of cultural genocide and being a hooligan government-which statements, of course, have come from some elements of Australian conservationists-as very offensive.

         —That is an interesting comment by Senator Coulter. He said that that is an accurate description of Malaysia. I might add that the High Commissioner found that very offensive. While conceding that there were what he described as law and order issues with the Penan people, the High Commissioner pointedly referred to Australia's treatment of its Aboriginal population and to forest disputes in New South Wales, Tasmania and Fraser Island. He concluded that, even though the Malaysians knew that Australia developed its farms and orchards from raping its rainforests earlier in its history, it is not an issue for Malaysia to ban Australian apples, meat or dairy products as Australia would like to do with Malaysia's timber.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Today, we have had headlines in the paper saying that Malaysia has decided to downgrade ties with Australia. The Malaysian Cabinet has decided to suspend all non-essential cooperative projects with Australia. The Malaysian Prime Minister has also proposed a regional trade bloc which would exclude Australia. And here we have the Democrats suggesting that we now hurt those people further, suggesting that we no longer accept their timber.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not sure what the Democrats want to do. I do not think that they do either. Do they want to ban all rainforest timber? In the second reading speech, Senator Coulter said that the import ban was the focus of this Bill. Is it a total import ban? The Democrats say that they want to ban only logs, sawn timber, veneers or plywood made from tropical forest species listed in this Bill. Other wood products, such as mouldings, window frames, doors and furniture, will still be able to be imported without restrictions. The reason given for this exemption is administrative difficulties in identifying species in the source areas within the particular country of the wood used in the products. The Democrats want only logs, sawn timber, veneers and plywood made from tropical forest species to be banned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed new subsection 50a (3) in clause 3 of the Bill-that is the most important part-states the conditions under which the Minister can use a licence to import tropical forest timbers. The wood must satisfy all the conditions listed. The conditions state that the wood must be identified as coming from a specific area of the country of origin. The wood must come from either plantations or secondary regrowth forests. How on earth will that be policed?
       </para>
       <para>
        They say that substantial areas of the forest from which the wood is taken must be adequately protected in secure parks and reserves. I will come back to the stupidity of this in just a moment. They go on to say that the owners and the inhabitants of the forests must approve the felling of the trees. They say that the felling of the trees cannot threaten the integrity of the forest or the ability of the forest to support the traditional inhabitants.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me go through those again. The Democrats say that the wood must be identified as coming from a specific area of the country of origin. How are they going to police that? There is no suggestion in their Bill as to how they would police that. They say that the wood must come either from plantations or from secondary regrowth forests. In what way will they be able to establish whether it comes from a primary forest or a regrowth forest? Nothing in the Bill tells us how they intend to do it. They say `substantial areas'. That is good legislation, is it not? What are substantial areas? What does Senator Coulter mean by `substantial'? I am not asking the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins); I am just wondering what on earth the Democrats could possibly mean by `substantial', because there is no indication in their Bill as to what it means.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill goes on to even more ridiculous stuff, saying that the owners and the inhabitants of the forests must approve of the felling of trees, and that the felling of the trees must not threaten the integrity of the forest or the ability of the forest to support the traditional inhabitants. Of course, the fact that the inhabitants could be forced out of the area before the logging was to commence so that their approval for the logging would not be necessary, and the fact that after it was logged there would be no inhabitants anyway, so the forest would not have to support any inhabitants, does not enter their minds. It is just unbelievable nonsense. As I say, I do not believe for one moment that this supposed legislation could ever have been taken seriously. There is nothing in the Democrats' legislation to say how they intend to police this logging.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we did set the example, if we were good citizens of the world, if we decided to stop the importation of all rainforest timbers, and even if Japan and the other countries that import rainforest timbers joined us, what proof have we that this would stop the felling of the rainforests? We have none at all. Would they be cleared for agriculture?

         —Senator Coulter says no. As far as I am concerned he is the only one in the world who has said no. Most people say-indeed, Coopers and Lybrand say-that that is the most important and largest purpose of clearing these forests. We have underdeveloped countries with growing populations, and Senator Coulter is expecting those forests to maintain their original inhabitants without any expansion. Senator Coulter says that he is right and, of course, Coopers and Lybrand-who are perhaps a little more reliable-say that they believe the main cause of tropical deforestation is the shifting of agriculture and formal development of programs, certainly not logging.

        The report also says that there is no justification for the introduction of supply restrictions of any kind. The options it mentions include encouraging substitutions through research and development; consumer education; improved efficiency in the use of timber; aid-related initiatives such as assisting in forest management; establishment of other forest industries in source countries; improved production from already cleared land; and international lobbying with source countries, other importing countries, international agencies and through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to improve market access for products from developing countries. I agree with that entirely.

        It is not that the world has no concerns about the depleting rainforests, but they are largely publicly owned forests and almost wholly located in developing countries with rapidly rising populations. These countries have widespread poverty and high levels of foreign debt. We have the Democrats here saying that we should add to those problems by refusing their exports. It is all very well living in this magnificent country, with the security that we have here and with no starvation, to tell them that they must not make use of their resources, that they must not expand, that they must not clear for agriculture and that they have to stay in their native forests.

It is all very well for the Democrats to tell these developing countries what they must do and that in return we will give them $60m a year in aid and to say that, if we do that, other Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development countries will build up a rainforest protection fund of several billion dollars. What absolute rubbish! Nobody has suggested that that would or could occur, yet the Democrats are willing to deal a death blow, if you like, to the very poor in these countries.

        These developing countries cannot possibly afford to withdraw their timbers from the market. It is up to Australia to help them with forest management so that these timbers can be an ongoing source of income. The fact that a low level of selective timber harvesting is possible and would add to the productive value of the forest is terribly important. Unlike some of the other products of the forests, such as nuts and latex trees, which are more subsistent in nature, timber is a cash crop. If the world price of rainforest timber were more realistic, then timber products could form an important and essential part of a sustainable rainforest economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the countries that we are talking about it cannot be forgotten that the problem of shifting agriculture will not go away, and that stopping logging will not save the major source of deforestation. The Democrats have to understand that if we stop importing these timbers it will not make one jot of difference to the deforestation of the rainforests in these underdeveloped countries. If these people cannot make money out of the rainforest timber, they will just slash and burn it to make money by growing food through agriculture. We have to make these rain- forests productive for them, and the only way we can do that is to send teams to teach management of those forests-and with that I would agree.

        On Wednesday there was a much healthier sign for Australia when the Rainforest Information Centre released the Australian Rainforest Memorandum, a document I strongly recommend that all honourable senators read for a thorough discussion of the reasons why Australia has a responsibility to act now to protect the world's remaining rainforests. The central premise of the Rainforest Memorandum is that the best way a country can contribute to the protection of rainforests is by examining its own actions. For Australia, this means both protecting our own rainforests-what is left of them and ensuring that no action taken by Australia, be it under the guise of aid or trade, should contribute to the destruction of rainforests in other parts of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to remind honourable senators for a moment of the bipartisan support this morning in this chamber when the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill 1991 was debated. I remarked then that it was refreshing to hear an issue debated purely on its merits rather than on party lines, although some party debate did come into it in one or two of the contributions. I hope that honourable senators will accept rainforest protection as worthy of similar support.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if it does not get that kind of bipartisan support in this chamber, I think it is highly commendable that Senator Coulter and his office workers have managed to gather the signatures of a record number of 31 members of Federal and State parliaments who are supporting this call for a ban on the import of rainforest timbers. It is very interesting that there is a long list of 31 members of Federal and State parliaments including Australian Democrats, Greens and Independents.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very pleased to see that I have been joined in the West Australian list by Dr Ian Alexander, who recently resigned from the Labor Party-he was the member for Perth; Ms Pam Buchanan, Independent member for Ashburton, who also recently resigned from the Labor Party in Western Australia; and Mr Ian Thompson, who resigned some time ago from the Liberal Party and is now an Independent member for the Darling Range. So there is some sense amongst the Independents who have been disaffected with the major parties on environmental and other issues such as social justice issues, the issue of our participation in the Gulf war, the way decisions are made in the larger parties and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a very interesting group and I commend Senator Coulter and his staff for getting the support of all those people around the country. It will probably not be the first time that there will be concerted effort on the part of non major party representatives at State and Federal level to work together on important issues of national and international significance. Indeed, in many ways, the need for action to stop the destruction of rainforests is of even more urgency than the issue I mentioned this morning, which was the protection of Antarctica. That is because, as the Rainforest Memorandum points out, the continuation of the present level of deforestation will result in the total destruction of the world's tropical rain- forests within 30 years. This is a fact which should be raising alarm right around the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        We may see the end of an entire forest type within our lifetime and that should be cause for extreme concern. Without concerted effort from all countries, our grandchildren could grow up in a world without tropical rainforests, and I certainly would not want to see that happen. I am sure that even if Senator Walters thought about it in those terms she would not want to see that either.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been efforts through various international programs to stop, or at least slow down, the rate of rainforest destruction but the results have been disappointing. Part of the reason for that is the complexity of the issue. But the sad fact of many of these programs is that they are developed without sufficient participation of the indigenous communities or the relevant non-government organisations. Of course, there is a great deal of power in non-government organisations not only in Australia but also in many countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        As in Australia, decisions on natural resource use are more likely to be acceptable if they are made in an open manner with adequate opportunities for the involvement of such community organisations. I totally agree with Senator Coulter's comments in his speech on the second reading of this Bill that the restriction of rainforest timber imports is only one part of a comprehensive strategy which is needed. It is, however, a vital part of the action that Australia can and should take.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Coopers and Lybrand report, which has been mentioned previously by Senator Walters this evening and on previous occasions in this chamber, has been used to deny the effectiveness of an import ban. The report lends support to the need for wider action. But that cannot be used as an excuse to avoid taking the relatively simple action of adopting this Bill as an affirmation of Australia's intent to see the destruction of the world's rainforests stopped. The scale and urgency of the problem is too great for direct and immediate action not to be necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred previously to the complexity of the problem of rainforest destruction. Somewhere between 50 and 90 per cent of all plant and animal species may be present in tropical rainforests, as Senator Bourne earlier alluded to, and are therefore at risk of extinction if we keep going at the same rate of destruction that is currently under way. The loss of rain- forests means an incalculable loss of genetic resources and other non-timber forest materials. This increases the gravity of the issue. The role of rainforest global climatic cycles is not yet fully understood, but there is already worrying evidence that climatic disturbances in Brazil and in the Ivory Coast may be related to massive deforestation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here I must comment on something Senator Walters just said. I was about to write down her classic quote which she gave us at the end of her speech when suddenly it was my turn. But she said something like, `The countries of the world that we are trying to ban these imports from need the rainforest timbers and if they cannot sell their timber resources then they will clear the forests for agricultural purposes'. Even if they do that-as has happened very widely in a country like Brazil-it has been clearly demonstrated that the soil on which rainforest timbers thrive is not suitable for agriculture. For one or two years there may be satisfactory cropping or there may be satisfactory grazing for cattle, which feed the hamburger market of North America and countries like Australia as well, but all too soon the soil which previously housed and nurtured the tropical rainforests is useless for agriculture. That has been demonstrated over and over again and so that is not a suitable argument to use in this debate.

        I want to turn to the Australian Rainforest Memorandum which was launched just this Wednesday. It is important to note that there are other uses on a sustainable level which can be much more useful to the global community than chopping down the timbers, because that is tantamount to mining. Once one has chopped down the rainforest timbers there is nothing there to get another time. But if we use a tropical rainforest in a sustainable way, then there is an ongoing constant yield and that is what I think we should be looking towards. I want to quote from this Rainforest Memorandum:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the governments of most tropical countries do not even gather information on the sustainable economic potential of non-timber rainforest products . . . In the Amazon Basin the livelihood of over two million people is based on the collection of rubber, Brazil nuts and other ``minor'' forest products. These people are able to gain their livelihood without damaging the biological integrity and genetic wealth of the rainforest ecosystems . . . Recent studies have shown that the value of non-timber forest products often far exceeds the value of timber in tropical forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a most important point; the renewable resources which can be harvested by the indigenous people in the rainforest are actually of greater economic benefit to the countries involved than chopping down the trees-which is a one-off exploitative action. The memorandum continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        A study in the rainforests in Peru showed that the economic value of the minor forest products including fruits, resins and medicines which were actually being marketed, exceeded the economic value of using the forest for timber by nine to one.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now that is a very significant figure and I think that the importance of that should not be lost on people who seem to be bent on opposing this legislation. On economic grounds alone there are very good reasons for countries being encouraged to use the renewable resources that the rainforests so generously provide rather than chopping down the trees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, it is important to note that intact primary rainforests have considerable and lasting economic potential as a storehouse of high value drugs useful in modern medicine. A lot of this is still an unknown quantity. A great deal of research is still to be done on the medical benefits to be derived from tropical rain forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        The economic benefits from the genetic material in rainforests have also been left out of the cost benefit analyses of development projects affecting rainforest areas. The extinction of a single plant species with genes that could be used in an agricultural crop may well represent a loss of billions of dollars. But we do not know enough about that yet. So that is why there is a plea to stop the cutting down of tropical rainforests while further research is undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        The negative effects and poor long term prospects of industrial development in tropical forests make the complete protection of the remaining primary rainforest imperative from an economic as well as an ecological point of view. Exceptions should only be allowed for traditionally established sustainable methods of utilisation or for uses which empirical scientific studies have proved beyond doubt to be ecologically sound. These options exclude widespread forestry practices and other forms of intensive exploitation. We have to remember those final two words, `intensive exploitation' because that is what it amounts to-the mining of the forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the effect of rainforest destruction on indigenous communities that increases the urgency for this Bill to be passed, and in that sense we have a moral obligation to take action now. The argument has been advanced from time to time that banning the import of rainforest timbers will only put economic hardship on those communities, as Senator Walters alluded to, but I do not think she did it very logically, and certainly it was not convincing to me.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality is that in many rainforest areas logging is the start of a process of dispossession of the indigenous people. Logging of tropical rainforests is too often the cause of further iniquities in land and wealth distribution both within and between countries. It seldom seems to have any effect in alleviating poverty but instead contributes to social disruption and, ultimately, the loss of entire cultures.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to give the example of the Penan tribespeople of Sarawak. The tribal wisdom of the Penan people is about to be lost to the world for ever unless the logging stops in their traditional rainforest home. It is not only the source of their food and every aspect of their livelihood but it is also the source of their spiritual integrity.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is really sad to hear people from the Penan, as we were privileged to do last year when some members of that fast disintegrating tribe came to Australia to make a plea to Australians not to buy rainforest timbers. They said, `Chop out the market rather than chop down the trees'. They told very, very sad stories about the disintegration of their tribal life and about the fact that they were losing their tribal homes, which have been theirs for countless generations. How can we consider doing that in this relatively enlightened time towards the end of the twentieth century?
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that we have just had the most ghastly example of unenlightenment in the Gulf war. Perhaps I should not even use that terminology. But we should know better at this stage of human development than to allow one of the last remaining tribal people to disappear from the face of the earth. I make an impassioned plea that we stop the importation of rainforest timbers because the Penan tribespeople are at risk of disappearing altogether from the face of planet earth or becoming spiritually deadened, even though physically some of them may be left. There are only 60 families left at the moment living according to their tribal culture; a mere 60 families. So it is very close to the end point for the Penan tribespeople, and their forest is being logged 24 hours a day-ruthless destruction of their habitat. If we allow that to happen in the latter part of the twentieth century, all the predictions of doom that have been suggested for people as an endangered species on planet earth will probably come to fruition.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not deserve to survive as a species-the rest of us who exploit in that way-if we allow the destruction of these tribal people, whose wisdom we should appreciate, whose wisdom we should respect, and whose age-old customs we should respect and revere as much as we possibly can, to go ahead just because we like their rainforest timbers. If we allow that, there is no doubt that the human species in general will be on the endangered species list itself. That is not a very comfortable place to be but that is where we would deserve to be if we allowed the destruction of the Penan people's habitat to continue at the rate that it is going at the moment, so that within 10 years they will be culturally and spiritually dead. That is a very, very serious responsibility for countries like Australia to think about very carefully.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill does in fact allow the importation of rainforest timbers under licence if certain conditions are met and wisely avoids using the criterion of so-called sustainable logging. The term `sustainable yield' has become as misused as the forest to which it is supposed to refer. A World Bank consultant is quoted in the Rain- forest Memorandum as saying that:
       </para>
       <para>
        No commercial logging of tropical forests has proven to be sustainable from the standpoint of the forest ecosystem, and any such logging must be recognised as mining, not sustaining the basic resource.
       </para>
       <para>
        The state of knowledge on tropical forest ecology and silviculture is not adequate to allow any empirical claims as to the sustainability of tropical forest logging operations. Despite this, and the acknowledgment by the International Tropical Timber Organisation that serious attempts at sustainable management are being made on less than 0.125 per cent of the rainforest area currently logged, there are still claims made to justify development assistance on the grounds that it is directed to sustainable forestry operations. How people come to that conclusion is beyond me. The Government's policy on rainforests states that:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's future timber needs should be met without placing at risk the long term conservation of the rainforest resources of other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is commendable. It assumes that tropical rainforests can be managed and logged on an ecologically sustainable basis which, as I demonstrated, is not possible. As yet, there does not appear to be evidence to support the possibility of ecologically sustainable logging of rainforest timbers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The role of development assistance is crucial in the protection of the world's rainforests and the populations of people dependent on them, and it is increasingly recognised that the direction of aid to environmental projects and the assessment of the environmental impacts of all development projects is essential. The findings of the Senate Inquiry on the Environmental Impact on Australian Development Assistance are yet to be fully addressed by the Government. But I look forward to the response to that report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I recommend again to senators that they read carefully the Australian Rainforest Memorandum and note the deplorable record of some Australian companies operating in the Asia-Pacific area. There are far too many examples of projects which have had devastating effects on the landscapes and the lifestyles of the people of the region. This morning during the debate on the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill I applauded the inclusion of clauses to prevent the involvement of Australian corporations in mining activities in any part of Antarctica. Reading the list of disastrous projects with which Australian companies are involved in rainforest operations, I am convinced that controls are needed on the activities of Australian companies to ensure that they operate with the same regard to environmental impacts in other counties as they would here in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to quote just a couple of the examples given in this Rainforest Memorandum about Australian operations in other countries, which are most obvious in our region-in Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The memorandum states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The three largest operations in which there is Australian involvement are the Ok Tedi and Bougainville mines in Papua New Guinea-
       </para>
       <para>
        although Bougainville has been closed now for two years-
       </para>
       <para>
        and the Freeport mine in Irian Jaya.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ok Tedi mine is located in one of New Guinea's remotest regions, high in the Star Mountains on the banks of the Ok Tedi River. The Ok Tedi flows into the Fly River, Papua New Guinea's major river system. Forty thousand people live beside the banks of the Fly and depend on it for food, water and transportation. BHP is a major shareholder in the consortium which controls this mining operation. Major shareholders in BHP include the Westpac Banking Corporation--

        I visited Ok Tedi just two weeks ago as part of the parliamentary delegation visiting Papua New Guinea. It was a very interesting visit, too. I was personally quite shocked at the amount of devastation which was there before us: a whole mountain had disappeared. The only Papua New Guinea person with us at that time to see this felt the same as I felt. He commented to me, `I bet the people here didn't know, if they were told about it in advance, that a whole mountain would disappear'. It has been gouged now right down to below ground level.

       <para>
        At this operation, 100,000 tonnes of waste a day are moved, most of which-78,000 tonnes a day-goes into the river. It is a very disturbing operation, to say the least. Sixty-six million tonnes of sludge goes into the river per year. Thirty-five million tonnes get to the Fly River mouth, a long way downstream, the rest of it being deposited on the way. The company was keen to point out that it did not affect fishing, but that is really debatable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In January 1984 a tailings dam which was being constructed was interrupted by a landslide. The cost of building a tailings dam would be $US44m. So it is not being built. There just is not a tailings dam. So all the tailings go down the river, to the extent of 78,000 tonnes per day, taking with them whatever is left after the processing has been done.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that the company said that it takes three weeks for the sediment to travel downstream; that there is a massive amount of fine mud at the mouth of the Fly which is coagulating at the river mouth; and that the dilution effect will get rid of a lot of the mud which comes down the river but that there is a collection of the copper at the base of this mud deposit. It is estimated that the mud will hold the copper deposits there for 100 years. How on earth the company comes to that conclusion, I do not know; but that is what it said. It said that, despite the fact that there are five-metre tides twice daily and a high water velocity, the mud would hold the copper sediments right there, so that we in Australia need not worry about the contamination of the Coral Sea with copper leftovers. That is another aspect of it. Apart from that, of course, the destruction of the rainforest timbers has gone into that.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many other examples in this rainforest memorandum of Australian companies not being careful about the environment of the countries in which they are operating-for massive profits. That is really where I think there is a big difference between the kind of argument that Senator Walters presented to the chamber and what is being said on the other side of the debate, where people are genuinely concerned about the protection of this resource for future generations. We are not interested in cash cropping the rainforest timbers. We are not interested in quick bucks being made out of a resource which is not renewable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will briefly mention rainforest management in Australia. I appreciate that the World Heritage listing of the Queensland wet tropical rainforests has greatly improved the prospects for the survival of those forests, although pressures continue through demands for tourism and mining and, of course, a space port proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        I had never actually been to the northern Queensland tropical rainforests until a week or so back, but it was quite an illuminating experience. The rainforests have often been called the womb of life. In the rainforest one can actually hear and feel the vibrancy and the pulsating of the rainforest. It would be a very sad thing if we were actually prepared to mine the rainforests of other countries. It is important that we hang on to what little we have left in Australia, but we must not deprive other countries of their resource, which is, of course, a global resource in terms of cleaning up the atmosphere.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is very interesting that in Victoria temperate rainforests are being logged in contravention of the State conservation strategy because of the overcommitment of the timber resource when long term timber licences were granted. It is interesting that the Victorian Government can say that the resource security legislation did not have an impact on it. The Western Australian Government can claim that, too. But, of course, what has happened is that, because of the overcommitment of timber resource in the past, we are actually logging the remaining bit of temperate rainforest in Victoria. I think that is a crime against future generations. As I said, the same thing is likely to happen in Western Australia, where there is already protection for the timber industry. In Western Australia, there are small patches of rainforest in the Kimberley region, where new species of plants are still being discovered. The rainforest fragments are only one of the many environmental and cultural treasures in the Kimberley region and lend weight to the call for the Kimberley wilderness to be recognised and fully protected.
       </para>
       <para>
        To come back to one of the comments that Senator Walters made, I agree with her that we cannot really tell other countries what to do with their resources. I had a very signal lesson on this when I went to see the Brazilian Ambassador a couple of years ago and talked to him about the debt for nature idea: to relieve some of the developing countries of their huge international debt, maybe other countries could help by buying some of the rainforest to ensure its preservation for future generations. He told me very politely to go away, which is fair enough. Neither should we tell other countries what to do with their resources. But they have been under enormous pressure in the past to finance their crippling debt repayments. The World Bank has put enormous pressure on them, but now the World Bank, thank goodness, seems to be changing its tune. The World Bank project, global environmental facility (GEF), is one where the World Bank has joined two United Nations agencies in a three-year pilot program which will help ease the pressure which developing countries are placing on the global ecosystem, in particular by chopping down their rainforests. I quote from AM this morning on the ABC:
       </para>
       <para>
        The GEF is to be funded by contributions from participating nations, but despite our attendance at a funding meeting last November, Australia is yet to commit itself to the project.
       </para>
       <para>
        The presenter, Peter Thompson, went on to report from Washington-an interview with Matt Peacock:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . Australia's reticence has already dented our reputation as a green conscious nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        So what has happened this week in this place over resource security legislation is matched by what we are doing internationally. We are not coming up with the goods. When a question was asked by Senator Bourne of the Minister this afternoon about that, he said, `Oh well, we can't keep paying for everything'. But Australia has international responsibilities. We are now unlikely to be invited to the first GEF meeting in six weeks time. I think that Australia, in that respect, is opting out of its international responsibilities. I hope that it does not opt out of its international responsibilities as far as banning the importation of rainforest timbers is concerned, in support of Senator Coulter's Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to end by commending the rainforest action groups around Australia, which have undertaken non-violent direct action to highlight the fact that rainforest timbers are constantly coming into Australia through our ports. Their very brave and pointed actions are educating the public to try to change consumer habits. They are also educating timber companies about alternatives to rainforest timbers. That is highly commendable, because there are alternatives; we do not have to use rainforest timbers in the way that they are being used at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there is an argument that the market economy should work. We need to educate people about alternatives so that they do not actually demand rainforest products, and so we actually show the countries from whom we buy at the moment that there is not a ready market. As well as that educative process in the community, we need a little legislative help. That is where this Bill is very important. We need education in the community plus legislation, and then there will not be a market for the rainforest timbers. The countries which at the moment exploit rainforest timbers might be encouraged to use the renewable resources in their rainforest timbers to make the money that they so urgently need. We have to stop mining the rainforests. It is the exploitative mentality which is really expressed in the `nothing left' option. The alternative is to allow wise use of rainforests in the truly renewable sense of the word.

         —Destruction of tropical rainforests is a major global ecological problem calling for urgent action. If action is not taken now, the world will continue to lose a resource of immense value at an alarming rate. Clearly, action must be taken. The question is: what is the most appropriate and responsible action that can be taken by Australia?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The approach embodied in the Customs (Rainforest Timber) Amendment Bill is fundamentally mistaken. If adopted, it would not contribute at all to a reduction in the loss of tropical rainforest. In fact, it would be counterproductive because it ignores the international political realities within which we must operate. Successful action to arrest tropical forest loss can be made only in cooperation with the governments in developing countries which are responsible for the forests. In the face of criticism that this legislation will barely create a ripple in the waters of international trade in tropical timber, the Australian Democrats have singled out the example of Malaysia where, according to Senator Coulter's second reading speech:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the impact . . . would be significant enough to be noticed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Curiously, Senator Coulter appears to see a move to damage the balance of trade for one of our near neighbours as some sort of a victory. In reality, the mere fact that the Bill is up for debate in this Parliament has put pressure on our very sensitive relationships with Malaysia, and while Senator Coulter and the Democrats no doubt gain some satisfaction out of knowing that something they have done might make one overseas country sit up and take notice, the vast majority of developing countries to which this Bill will apply in practice will hardly notice in terms of lost trade, but they will be justified in criticising a country which prides itself on a commitment to free trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes to show that the Democrats do not give these countries credit for having the nous to recognise that it is in their own interests to manage the timber resources in a sustainable way. That we need to do it for them by imposing bans-what an absolute insult to these countries, and what a shocking way for any political party in Australia to try to dabble in foreign relations. I can only think that Senator Coulter has absolutely no conception of the conditions in most developing countries which the proposed changes to the Customs Act would affect, and no idea about the resolve in many of the governments concerned to develop proper forest management techniques. One then might ask why the Democrats bothered with the political stunt of introducing this Bill. I suppose we have only to read this morning's newspapers to understand why the Democrats have to resort to these sorts of stunts. The Sydney Morning Herald today leads with a headline that says, `Angry Greens plan new political party'. Peter Garret tonight on the 7.30 Report said the same thing. The Democrats are petrified that a new political party might arise and take from them the measly 7 per cent of the vote which they still hold.
       </para>
       <para>
        People laughed at me a few months ago when I reported that Senator Vallentine and the Tasmanian Greens were getting together to work out some way to take over the Democrats. They have obviously realised the Democrats are a spent force anyhow and do not want to take them over; they are going to form their own party. Can honourable senators imagine what a new Green party would do to this mob over here? Their 7 per cent vote-which has fallen from 14 per cent at the election-would disappear completely and they would be out of a job. Would that not be a great thing for Australia, and a great thing for Australia's foreign relations? That is what the stunt is all about. The Democrats are trying to recover some lost ground. They thought they were doing well in the Gulf war, but then realised that 66 2/3 of their supporters did not support them, so they are trying to claw back at anything they can- hence the stunt of this sort of rubbishing legislation.

       <para>
        Just over a month ago I spent some time travelling in Indonesia as part of a parliamentary delegation. From what I saw there, I have no doubt that Indonesia has already made some significant steps towards improvement and plans to do much more in the years to come. The changes it has made, and continues to make, aim to reduce the amount of timber felled while increasing export revenue for the people of Indonesia. Three years ago, the Indonesian Government banned the export of round logs, a move which led to significant reductions in logging while maintaining the same financial return to the country. It has more recently imposed a tax on sawn timber, which has led to an increase in the value added timber industries and to reduced timber loss while maintaining income levels. Indonesia has also banned the export of unprocessed rattan cane, again to encourage value added industries and to prevent wholesale destruction of the resource.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the Democrats that countries such as Indonesia know the value of tropical forests as a resource and want to maintain it for the interests of future generations. Furthermore, governments of these countries know their own backyards far better than we do, and are far better qualified to know what measures to improve forest management are appropriate. We should be encouraging them to do this by working with them, not trying to isolate them. It is no good the developed world lecturing or threatening less developed countries when such actions would have major economic implications for those countries, unless they are prepared to address those consequences. It might make some Australians feel good if their country were to ban imports, but the results on the ground would almost certainly be counterproductive.
       </para>
       <para>
        What these countries desperately need is forest management technology. I cannot think of any other country in the world better suited to help in this area. Our foresters and scientists, in this area of tropical timber in particular, are second to none in the world. I have had some dealing with our foresters. Last weekend I was on Fraser Island talking to the foresters. I am aware of the timber industry in Ravenshoe, and have been for some time. Those people are dedicated professionals. They know what they are doing. They are university trained, most of them at the Australian National University. They are young, dedicated people who have a real feeling and a concern for the forests that I suspect the Democrats and Senator Vallentine would not know about, would not understand and would not care about.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was interested to hear Senator Vallentine say she had been up to the northern tropical rainforest. She would not answer my interjection to tell me where she was, but I would guarantee that any of the rainforests that Senator Vallentine was able to get into-and which she marvels about and says are magnificent-are the forests that have been logged for 100 years. Yet people such as Senator Vallentine, and anyone else who might go to see them, will walk through them and say, `Aren't these forests magnificent? Aren't they virginal? Aren't they pristine?'. Yet they are forests that have been logged for 100 years under sensible forest management plans. That is what is needed. In addition, I have spoken with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation people in Ravenshoe, who understand timber and have some real knowledge about it. They, as well as the Queensland forestry service, are dedicated professionals who have an expertise and learning which would be of immense benefit to the countries to our near north.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are already involved in the area of forest management in many places. I had the privilege to be in West Timor recently and heard of the plantation projects already under way there in which Australia has been involved. That is being done to help prevent the slash and burn agriculture. We could be doing much more in this area and a concerted assistance to the operation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to Indonesia and other countries would be a good point on which to begin. Such cooperation must be based on the premise that it is in the best interests of the developing countries concerned to manage their forests much better than they have in the past. The tropical forests are a valuable resource which can yield a wide range of potential long term benefits to developing countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sometimes this may involve conversion of forests from their pristine state to secondary regrowth, with some loss of biodiversity within defined areas. At other times it may involve very selective logging or harvesting of forest products without logging. The preservation of these resources and their management under conditions of sustainable development are clearly in the interests of the developing countries themselves. It is not clear from what Senator Coulter has said that he accepts this or accepts that the utilisation of timber from the tropical forests has a legitimate place in the range of conditions under which forests are managed and preserved. We should accept that governments of these countries by and large accept the need to improve their management practices, but they are unable to achieve these improvements overnight for the very reason that they are developing countries with limited infrastructure and shortages of key skilled personnel.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the institutional deficiencies in the developing countries, the certification process required under this legislation proposed by Senator Coulter is totally unrealistic. It is by no means a simple matter of imposing bans and tough penalties in these countries. The forests are too extensive and mostly in remote locations, institutions are generally too weak and logging is only one of a range of threats facing the forests. Shifting cultivation is a more serious threat than logging and plantations, and pastoral activities have also claimed many rainforests.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coulter quotes statistics from Sarawak about losses of forests to slash and burn agriculture, but fails to recognise that loss of secondary forests and prevention of regrowth is also a loss of a resource. It may make more sense to ban the importation of beef produced on cleared rainforest, or chocolate produced from cocoa from cleared rainforest or starch produced from casaba, or paper from kenaf and so on. If the market for timber products were severely reduced or disappeared altogether in these countries, the likelihood is that the land uses, such as clearing for agriculture spurred by poverty and population pressures-the major cause of deforestation in tropical countries-would result in even greater forest loss. Senator Coulter should think about that. His simplistic solution to these things shows a narrowness of foresight that is typical of him and his Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only a complex framework of licensing, with incentives to balance utilisation and conservation properly framed, can provide the regulation needed to manage the forests in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. This is no easy task and must take account of the resources and needs of local communities if it is to be implemented. Experience with the total ban on ivory, which was much more uniformly implemented in developed countries than any ban on tropical forest products could ever be, suggests that the lack of incentive to manage a resource for long term benefit can lead to its total destruction. The honourable senator should think about that, too.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is called for is one of the most complex processes of institution building facing many developing countries. It must simultaneously tackle a wide variety of forest problems-natural forest management, plantation forests, utilisation of forest products-while at the same time dealing with a variety of related agricultural issues. Governments in developing countries need to have access to, amongst other things, proper inventories of their resources. Without this, plans cannot be prepared to optimise the benefits achieved from forest products while ensuring the resources are not degraded.
       </para>
       <para>
        Without a proper planning base, governments cannot enact regulations cap- able of being enforced. There are also urgent needs for systems of monitoring compliance, including the provision of staff with appropriate training and skills and, no less urgently, a need for communities to be educated about the resources they use. These needs call for large scale investment of resources, including substantial transfers of skills from developed countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has the technical capacity to contribute a great deal more than we have thus far. Australian technology in remote sensing, for example, is highly developed and could play a major part in assisting developing countries to manage their resources in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. Scientific expertise available in Australia can also play a part advancing the ability of developing countries' institutions to better manage their forest resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        Developed countries, as major consumers of value added products from tropical forests that generate substantial tax revenues, have both an obligation to contribute to the improvement of management practices in the tropical forests of the developing world and the technology to enable developing countries to make such improvements. This can only be achieved, however, by working closely with developing countries, accepting that they genuinely want to maintain their forest resources-for reasons of self-interest as much as anything else-and recognising that bans and restrictions would only harm our ability to do something constructive in cooperation with the governments of developing countries in the region. How can one cooperate and give the assistance wanted when one insults these countries by even suggesting legislation as ridiculous as this?
       </para>
       <para>
        Developing countries should, of course, contribute greater resources themselves. In many cases, the collection of revenues from timber products is less than it should be. There is often widespread avoidance of payment of taxes and fees, which calls for an increased institutional capacity in order to minimise such avoidance. If this can be done, developing countries will be able to afford to allocate far greater resources to forest management. We should also be aware that the fact that timber is generally exported as logs or sawn timber, rather than products with substantial value added, reduces the opportunities for tax collection in developing countries. Such opportunities are passed to the developed country consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a global problem, tropical forest management calls for global solutions. Unilateral bans or restrictions by Australia fail to see these problems in a global context and, as I said, are a narrow minded attempt to do something warm about the problem. What is called for is a global approach such as the tropical forest action plan program being carried out by the FAO.
       </para>
       <para>
        This program provides a common framework for assessing programs needed in each country to end the waste and destruction of tropical forests and allows developed countries to provide assistance in support of such programs. This is a constructive and practical way in which Australia can do something to halt the destruction of tropical forests. Conversely, if we adopt a course of imposing bans we will be ignored by developing countries and miss the opportunity to make a contribution that only Australia, a developed country with a substantial tropical forestry resource, can make.

        It is interesting, I might say, to note that in this particular debate the Government has not bothered to even list a speaker on the speakers' list. One wonders why the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has not done so. It could be that none of its members could keep a straight face when they read some of the ridiculous provisions of this Bill. Maybe that is the reason why they are not speaking on it. It could be, however, that they are not wanting to offend the greens. In this week they have done enough offending of the greens to turn them away forever. I suppose the Government is trying, a bit like the Democrats, to retrieve something out of the fiasco of this week and is not wanting to speak, and hopefully in a neutral way it will not--

The third reason why ALP members are not talking on this could be, of course, that they are all out in the back room, all the factions, trying to work out some sort of approach to this Bill. The different factions of the ALP would all have different thoughts on it and I guess some of the loony left of the ALP would be over there with their fourth wing mates in wanting to support it.

It is high time that the Government announced a decision on this matter to remove the concern of Australia's near neighbours about the threats of import bans and to assure them of our desire for some constructive involvement with them, some cooperative involvement with them, to do something about what everyone sees as a very real problem. This is what the Liberal and National parties are advocating, and we would urge that the Government adopt that sort of approach as well.

        As well as that cooperative approach, we should be giving massive assistance to these countries in the techniques of forest management and the ways in which they can protect their forests and deal with them properly. We should be supporting projects to reduce pressures on remaining forests, such as improved production from the already cleared lands, and we should be improving the efficiency of the use of tropical timbers in Australia. These are some positive suggestions, and the main one is cooperative help to the countries to our north. These are some positive ways in which we could help solve this problem, rather than resorting to the type of ridiculousness that this Bill suggests. I urge the Government to support us in rejecting this Bill.

         —In that lengthy meandering, we did not hear anything more than a noisy bag of wind-which is usually a Scottish instrument with a very poor mouthpiece, which usually contributes only a cacophony of useless noise, and does not contribute anything to the progress of human civilisation. It was really only a catalogue of excuses as to why we should do nothing and why we should not care about the rainforests. If Senator Macdonald had any observation powers he would have noticed that, for example, with the preservation of both whales and elephants, the tactic which was adopted-it is the most effective tactic that we can use to preserve unique resources-was that of refusing to buy the products.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The illustration was given most adequately in the example of elephant tusks. The countries in which the elephants have an origin beg the world not to buy ivory. They even burn the supply to demonstrate how desperate they are to stop the trade. That is the example: do not buy the product; preserve the resource. But Senator Macdonald was not enlightened enough to observe that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had some babbling on about Indonesia, assuming what management practices were taking place there. The forest destruction process in that country has been transferred to Irian Jaya. The managed forests which Senator Macdonald assumed were being managed correctly might, eventually, be able to provide products in a sustainable way, but that has not yet been demonstrated and Senator Macdonald's arrogant assumptions will never help that demonstration take place. A similar arrogance was demonstrated by Senator Walters in her confused meanderings and perambulations around the reality which takes place. She quoted Coopers and Lybrand in preference to the people directly involved in the issue. She suggested that because Australia took less than 5 per cent of certain areas that that might be all right; in other words, if somebody else is raping, burning and pillaging, it is all right for us to join in. To suggest that we are helping, as Senator Walters did, native peoples who own rainforests by paying other entrepreneurs to destroy their resource is arrogance and paternalism in the extreme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Vallentine's figures demonstrated the economic advantages to be gained from taking advantage of the renewable resources which are provided by the rainforests. Such economic advantages can be demonstrated to the people who live in those areas, and such economic advantages should be made available to them. They will not be available if we mine that resource with our international entrepreneurs. Senator Walters also suggested that Malaysia was very sensitive about import bans, that our activities in suggesting that a ban might take place were a little offensive because of what we have done in the past with our forests and what we do now in relation to the Aboriginal people of Australia.

       <para>
        Must we accept the offending products of other countries? Must we buy something simply because, if we do not, the seller might be a bit upset? There is no compulsion to buy things. There is no compulsion to use products of another nation, especially not when substitution with plantation timbers is possible for all the uses to which rainforest timbers are put. This seemed to escape the contributors from the coalition. The Customs (Rainforest Timber) Amendment Bill 1990, which is before us, really is an open invitation to the Hawke Government to do itself a political favour. It hardly needs pointing out that the Government's environmental stocks have fallen sharply since the last election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the last 11 months we have seen disastrous decisions on the south-eastern forests resource security, a half-hearted commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a total failure to incorporate sustainability principles in economic policy. Sustainability has been a buzz word which has been mouthed regularly by this Government, but when it comes to applying it to anything so substantial as economic policy, there is a deafening silence. All these failures have a common cause. Had the Government taken the right decision in each case, then significant economic restructuring would have been required. But if the Government were to support this Bill, which would impose selective restrictions on the importation of tropical rainforest timbers, then those problems would not arise. That is because there would not be any major losers in Australia. We could restrict the importation of tropical timbers tomorrow and hardly notice the difference in terms of what products were available.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major cost to the Australian community would, in fact, arise from the other element of this dual-track strategy; that is, to provide substantial aid to help ecologically sustainable economic alternatives to large scale rainforest logging. That cost would be borne equally by all taxpayers. The Australian Democrats propose that substantial amounts of aid should be offered in the order of $100m to be fully funded by the measures outlined in our alternative Budget proposals for this financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that there is widespread support in the Australian community for restricting rainforest timber products and very little serious opposition. In a recent newspaper article, which I managed to glean, there was a call by architects for a ceiling on imported goods. Even though it came from a different perspective and that group may have been motivated by different reasons to those which motivates this particular Bill, the call by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the Advance Australia Foundation and the Industrial Supplies Office recommended in a joint submission to Senator Button that a content of 90 per cent of Australian materials in new buildings and homes be imposed immediately. The reason that scheme received support from Australia's largest building material manufacturers-BTR Nylex, Boral Ltd and CSR Ltd-was that for every $1m of imported building material, only eight Australians are employed. The Executive Director of the Industrial Supplies Office, Mr Roy Lilley, said that if $1m worth of material were locally produced, 33 Australians would be employed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is widespread support for this sort of action throughout the Australian community. It is that widespread support which the Australian Democrats have noticed-contrary to Senator Macdonald's assumptions-and that is what inspires this sort of Bill that has come before us now. The most recent evidence of support comes from the Australian rainforest memorandum which was launched yesterday by the Rainforest Information Centre and the Wilderness Society. It was also endorsed by 36 other organisations including environment groups, development agencies, churches, trade unions and businesses, which together represent some half a million members. Other recent expressions of support for import restrictions have come from a group of prominent actors and artists and from the Local Government Association of New South Wales.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill has won the endorsement of every Democrat and independent member of parliament in the parliaments of this country, with the exception of Senator Harradine. I stress, however, that Senator Harradine has not refused to sign it in endorsement, but is actually listening and bringing his wise deliberations to the debate which is happening now. The 31 parliamentarians who have given their support cover all parliaments of Australia. The Australian campaign to save the world's tropical rainforests is part of a global campaign which is growing daily. Greenpeace's research has found that approximately 1,000 local government authorities in Europe have stopped using tropical timber cut from unsustainable sources and they are recommending that local businesses and individuals do the same. A dozen large city councils, including Berlin and Frankfurt, are also supporting indigenous people's efforts to protect their forests and their cultures- I will emphasise that for Senator Macdonald's benefit-by way of a climate pact that includes measures to limit carbon dioxide emissions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Austrian Parliament has declared that imports of unsustainably cut timber will be banned. It is working out ways of implementing that measure. The Netherlands Parliament is due to debate legislation imposing such a ban by 1995 under strict ecological and social definitions of sustainability. The State of Arizona in the United States is reported to have stopped using tropical timbers, as have the federal railways of Germany and Switzerland and the German department of administrative services. So much for the notion that we alone are considering this. So much for the notion that only one vote does not count. Any politician should know that one vote is as important as another.

        —We now return to the important discussion of the evening. I was summing up before the dinner recess when we broke to discuss that non-piece of legislation, the Customs (Rainforest Timbers) Amendment Bill, which the Senate has been debating for the last hour and a half. I believe that the Government industry statement represents an undisciplined retreat from the policies that this Government has put in place in the last eight years. It is nothing but that. We were expecting a statement that would get Australia moving again. I am disappointed that the statement will not do that.
       </para>

      <para>
       I was very disappointed that Cabinet did not support the submission of the Grains Council of Australia on a one-off cap gross national product of $150 a tonne for wheat at the next harvest. Instead, we got $100m which equates to about $6 per tonne extra in growers' pockets in March for wheat grown last season. Although we are thankful for small mercies, it will not be nearly enough to give wheat growers around Australia the confidence to plant a full crop for next year.
      </para>
      <para>
       This would have been only a contingent liability over the next three years if the unthinkable happened and we produced another wheat crop sold at low prices. It has been reported in the newspapers that the last wheat sale to Egypt was around $US128 a tonne, which equates roughly to $A170. I believe we are out of the trough. I know that other countries that may wish to buy wheat from Australia in the next few months will have to pay around $US130 a tonne. I believe that, once again, we are climbing out of the trough. If the Government had acceded to this request it would have given growers in the industry confidence to plant. It would have given the banks confidence to lend to the wheat growers. That way we could retain our traditional markets, which we may not be able to hold if we do not grow our normal crop next year.
      </para>
      <para>
       We must produce our way out of this depression. The only way we can do it is by production. Primary industry can do it if it can get back on an even keel. The mining industry is doing it and has always done it. However, for the mining industry to do that, it needs to have access to resources. I was walking through Members Hall this evening on my way to a meeting on the House of Representatives side of the building when I heard, I think, George Negus lacing Senator Walsh. Which greenie outfit he represents, I do not know. I know that I have criticised Senator Walsh tonight for all the mishmash that he has caused since 1983 in regard to other measures. However, he had the temerity to suggest that mining companies should have access to the resources at Coronation Hill and other such places and George Negus had the temerity to flog Senator Walsh for this view. If we are to produce our way out of this depression, we must have access to those resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, there must also be increased productivity on the factory floor, on the waterfront, in transport and all other areas that can help us to become competitive with the rest of the world. That includes the public sector, the people who are on the public payroll. If those people could produce a little more for what they are paid, we would get a lot further in this country.

       That is the way we will get out of this recession-or this depression. It is not a recession; it is a depression. It is a long time since it was a recession. It is a full blown depression. It is the biggest depression since 1935 or 1936, or whenever it was. That is the only way.

       We welcome one aspect of these statements. Clearly, the Government has now realised that the period when we could use wholesale deregulation and monetary policy to depress the economy as a whole has gone. Now we must rely on specific targeted Government intervention. Very many of the measures contained in these statements, such as the wholesale tax, are indeed welcome. The wholesale tax exemption will now apply to preproduction activities in research, development, engineering and technical design. It will apply also to production related activities such as ordering raw materials and post production activities including storage, handling and dispatch, staff training and others.

       In the same vein we support the additional funding that has been allocated to the Export Finance Insurance Corporation. This funding totals $250m. In particular, Australian Democrat support is being extended to the funds being allocated to employers to enable them to maintain apprenticeships and work experience programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       We note also with interest and approval that the Government is now prepared to extend some sectional assistance to various industries. We note that these particular industry statements do that in the case of the aerospace and information industries. However, we wonder what happened to environmental technology, alternative energy development and the pharmaceutical industry. Clearly, these are industries which would have repaid in ample measure any development investment that the Government might have cared to make to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       We also note with approval the fact that the Prices Surveillance Authority will be asked to monitor the effect on prices of continuing protection to the extent that the Government is still prepared to extend it. We note that not before time the developing country preferences will be removed from Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, which are hardly any longer developing countries; they are very much developed countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       To our regret, many areas in this industry statement ignore the needs of our community, the needs of our economy. The current tax deductibility for research and development of 150 per cent will be reduced to 125 per cent after 1993-hardly the sort of measure we need if we are to become the clever country.
      </para>
      <para>
       We note the anti-dumping procedures and the promises that the time scales will be reduced; however, we regret that the onus is not reversed after the initial prima facie case is established. I would have thought it was time that we were tougher on those countries that dump their products-produced in conditions which are way below our own in terms of wages, safety conditions at work and environmental protection-and that we protected our own industries much faster, placing the obligation on those countries to prove that they were not dumping and swamping our markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       Perhaps one of the worst examples of the Government's mistaken strategies in this statement is that it has announced the abolition of the existing higher sales tax rate on luxury cars. We would have gone the other way. We would have included in the higher luxury duty category items similar to high priced luxury cars, such as jewellery and furs. However, the Government has decided that it does not care about the couple of hundred million dollars of additional debt that the import of these high priced cars will bring to us and is more concerned, once again, about the short term implications for revenue.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact that there is no equity capital fund for small and medium business is perhaps one of the worst examples of the neglect of our long term strategy in this industry statement. This was one of the forecasts made quite regularly when this statement was being prepared. We read in the media that one insurance company, the AMP, had decided that it would not supply the $100m that the Government expected, and that was sufficient for the Government to abandon the project. Unfortunately, that is not the way to give our small and medium enterprises a chance to participate in the reactivation of our economy. It shows up the failure of specific measures that we need to bolster, in a parallel development, the reduction in tariffs and agricultural subsidies. It should be noted at this particular point that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said:
      </para>
      <para>
       However much our competitors might bend or break the principles of fair trade, our own self-interest is served by a steadfast refusal to return to the days of protectionism.
      </para>
      <para>
       In other words, the Prime Minister is saying that, no matter how high the protective tariffs or the subsidies are that the European Community or the United States is prepared to offer its own agricultural producers or its own industries, we will deliver our primary producers and our industries on the altar of the free markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       We believe that the tariff cuts proposed for agricultural products should not proceed unless the United States, the European Community and Japan agree to liberalise trade in agriculture. Tariffs will, in fact, be increased if necessary in other areas to prevent access to Australian markets in retaliation for such protectionism by other countries. They are prepared to offend the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Why should we be concerned not to protect our own industries, not to protect our jobs, and not to protect our primary producers?
      </para>
      <para>
       There is another aspect that we should pay attention to when we consider the level of tariffs in our country; that is, the standards that we wish to maintain in Australia: the wage standards; the standards of working conditions in terms of health and occupational safety; and the standards of environmental protection. Where we are competing against countries where wages are perhaps half, perhaps one-tenth, of what we need to pay our workers to maintain reasonable living standards, when we need to enforce environmental standards to ensure that our children have clean water and clean air, we should be prepared to pay to protect our industries to the necessary extent to ensure that we do not suffer from the poor conditions in other countries. I call that the exploitation index, and I give notice that the Australian Democrats will develop such an exploitation index to catalogue the countries where conditions are at such low levels that we cannot be, and should not be, expected to compete with them.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are other measures which the Government has neglected in this statement and which the Australian Democrats would believe would enable us to help our industries to weather the storm that they are now facing with the reduced tariffs which will come down to an average of 5 per cent by 1996. One of these would be to place a bounty of 5 per cent on the value of new exports, other than minerals and petroleum. This would be a transition measure to ease the competitive disadvantage still suffered by Australian firms in respect of transport costs and through cheaper imports arising from the general tariff cuts. Last year, had that measure been in place, we would have spent $140m to support new exports of $2.8 billion. It would have been cheap to spend another $140m to double that export figure. I trust that the Government will consider such an incentive to our industries in future.
      </para>
      <para>
       We believe that in general terms genuine micro-economic reform involves a significant shift in the proportion of the national freight handled by rail. This will be achieved only by substantial infrastructure investment, and a proportion of an increased fuel excise should be directed to fund such an infrastructure develop- ment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Democrats would have wished to see a number of other measures included in the Government's statement. I will list a few more. The rate of interest withholding tax should be increased from the existing 10 per cent to 15 per cent with treaty countries and to 39 per cent with non-treaty countries. This would be a measure to make it less attractive for foreign lenders to supply loan funds and would have, as a by-product, the result of bringing our exchange rate down, something that would support our exporters and would discourage imports.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the financial sector we are now facing a situation where only financial re- regulation and savings incentives would increase Australia's savings ratio, thereby closing the existing current account deficit. Interest rates ceilings should be reimposed for small business and home loans and margins on credit cards should be examined by the Prices Surveillance Authority and regulated accordingly. National regulation of non-bank financial institutions is necessary to protect our investors and to ensure that sufficient funds flow into equity funds for our industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The resources of the Reserve Bank of Australia should be boosted to cope with the additional workload that this fiduciary supervision would entail. One of the ways to do that would be through the imposition of an annual licence fee on banks who at present pay nothing for the right to trade. There are other areas. The Trade Practices Act should be amended to reintroduce the merger criteria in existence pre-1977 to prevent undue concentration of ownership, particularly in the media area. These are amendments that I will move when the trade practices legislation is before the Senate shortly.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have mentioned before that we would have expected the Government, when looking at industry sectors deserving of support because of their capacity to repay such support, to boost the recycling industry and other industries dealing with conservation and developing technology designed to protect the environment. We believe, therefore, that the recycling industry should be boosted by removing the existing 20 per cent sales tax on recycled plastic products. The increased use of recycled products would open new markets, reduce imports of plastic products-worth $483m last year-and make waste disposal savings for local government. All recycled paper products would be made sales tax free, just as stationery was some time ago after pressure from the Australian Democrats.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are other areas in this general area of conservation and alternative energy. We believe that fuel efficiency and emission targets are needed for the motor vehicle industry to ensure that Australian production will match or exceed international best practice. This will give long term access to export markets which will become much more environmentally protective over the coming decades.
      </para>
      <para>
       Perhaps the worst example that we have had in recent days of the short term, short-sighted approach that the Government is taking to the development of our economy is the resource guarantee legislation that it has foreshadowed. The Australian Democrats believe that, if we put our minds to it, and if we concentrate on alternatives such as the development of plantations, we would have an effective resource guarantee and would not need to hoe into our natural forests and demolish them for short term economic gain. In fact, we believe that taxation should be progressively shifted away from income to the extraction and consumption of natural resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we look at the thrust of this industry statement we become conscious of its myopic nature. In summary, we should look at three areas where action in the long term is absolutely essential to get us finally to the point where we can aim for not only a sustainable economy but indeed a sustainable society. One initiative would be to make us the clever country through a research and development guarantee scheme similar to the model that we have in the training guarantee scheme which is now in place. It is in this way that we could hope to reach the sorts of development expenditure levels existing in Japan, Switzerland, the United States of America and Germany.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that the second major initiative that we need is a comprehensive retraining and income support scheme to ensure that displaced workers are retrained and relocated to subsequent employment instead of merely being made redundant. Currently we are telling unemployed people that they should be retrained, but what do they do if they are breadwinners and have to look after a family of dependants? We must make it possible, through a guaranteed income scheme that gives them the right to retraining, for industry to have the necessary flexibility to cope with the reductions in tariffs and to enable individual people to survive.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, it is time for us to look at our industrial relations system and, rather than move to the free-for-all jungle warfare that Senator Kemp and others on his side would prefer, we should look at the sort of industrial relations system that central European countries have put in place. If they have been able to do that, why do we persist with the adversarial system and why do we on the other side wish to take it even further and have a system where people are at each other's throats instead of a system where the interests of workers and employers are recognised as being complementary?
      </para>
      <para>
       Clearly, the first step towards such a measure would be for workers to have employee share ownership schemes in the enterprises in which they work and for them to be represented at board level. The Australian Democrats would favour taxation incentives to companies which were prepared to take such a far-sighted step to ensure that the interests of workers and employers are recognised as complementary, and that the industrial relations practice that follows from such structural adjustments results in a climate which will ensure that we have a cooperative effort in our industries rather than a confrontationist one.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have sketched out a range of initiatives that we would have liked to see in the industry statement. Seeing that the Government has now started to pay some attention to interventionist policies rather than abdicate its responsibility and let the markets take the hindmost, I express the hope that at least some of these measures will be implemented in future.
      </para>
      <para>
       In expressing that hope I refer to a question asked by Senator Archer as early as 10 December 1990. Senator Archer, who is known for his interest in and support for scientific research, asked Senator Button whether the Government was prepared to look at a rescue strategy involving stronger export development grants and incentives; Government provision of seed capital to selected promising high-tech industries to encourage banks and other lenders to participate; and a mandatory requirement on superannuation funds and other big institutions to invest one per cent of their funds in the technology sector. If Senator Archer from the conservative coalition can express such interest and such hopes, then I believe that our Government and Prime Minister Hawke might well reach that point of thinking as well.

       <para in-line="1">
        —In speaking very briefly tonight on the industry statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) entitled Building a Competitive Australia, I want to focus on two major areas of considerable concern to me: firstly, labour market and training or, as it is called in the statement, the clever country and, secondly, proposed resource security legislation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I welcome the initiatives detailed in the labour market and training area which cover so many strategies to strengthen the skills of Australian workers and in particular job seekers. These measures-concerning job skills, Skillshare, job seekers, Jobtrain and Jobstart-at a cost of over $100m will ensure that in the current recession training is maintained in readiness for an upturn in the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also good to see that a further $130m-plus will be used in three ways: firstly, to assist the States and Territories to provide young people with vocational training; secondly, to help unemployed apprentices and those facing the risk of retrenchment continue or complete their training; and, thirdly, a new program, training and skills, to help employers retain workers under the threat of retrenchment. I am sure that honourable senators will agree, regardless of which side of the chamber they sit on, that these measures are very appropriate in these difficult times.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, the allocation of nearly $23m on literacy and numeracy programs, including workplace literacy, guarantees a three-year program to provide special training and support for unemployed people with limited literacy and numeracy skills. As a former teacher specialising in remedial education, I especially welcome this recognition of some of the very considerable problems that these young people have in making the adjustment from school to work. This is difficult for people with limited literacy and numeracy skills at the best of times, and these are the most disadvantaged of our young job seekers at the moment. Clearly, this initiative in regard to literacy and numeracy will assist these young people.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further initiative in the Prime Minister's industry statement, the good school strategy, is one that I wonder whether it is copied from the local government scheme that I oversaw for nearly three years, the innovations program in local government. This was a most effective scheme in that it gave opportunity for recognition within local government of innovative ways of approaching the many responsibilities of local government. It was able to spread those very innovative and effective practices around the country.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know as a teacher that there are many teachers and many individual schools involved in similar innovative fields in education. Yet, we have failed in the past to be able to communicate those ideas and practices effectively around the country. I suppose it has been done to a certain extent through conferences, but it has not been approached in such a comprehensive way.
      </para>
      <para>
       I certainly hope that the good school strategy with the $10m that has been allocated to identify the best practiced organisations and structures in our 10,000 schools will enable Australia's teachers and students to benefit from a special focus on these proven methods and programs. In addition-as I am well aware of the special problems that young people face in rural areas-the country areas program extension, an educational program that will give special support and recognition to rural students particularly in these difficult times, will give an extra $15m to the program to try to encourage higher retention rates in rural areas. Again, this is an area of considerable need if these young people are going to acquire the skills to move on into the workplace.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second area of concern to me this evening is the decision to include proposed resource security legislation in the industry statement which, as many people will recognise, is controversial and requires very careful consideration, interpretation and a degree of open-mindedness in the coming months. On the one hand, we have the Federal Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Ros Kelly, assuring us that the proposed legislation will ensure that environmental and heritage protection remain a priority for Australia's native forests. I would commend the Minister on her very strenuous efforts to seek guarantees in this regard. In her press release she says:
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the proposed legislation environmental, heritage, cultural, social and economic assessments will now be done prior to the granting of resource security to that project.
      </para>
      <para>
       These assessments will for the first time ensure the identification of conservation needs for the region from which a project will draw its supply before that project can proceed.
      </para>
      <para>
       By basing the security guarantee on the volume of timber to be supplied for any project, we will retain greater flexibility to protect areas of high conservation value.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the new legislation I will have a direct role in ensuring that conservation and heritage values are properly and comprehensively assessed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will also have a role in determining appropriate conditions set for forest management and for periodic review of forest management and environmental protection practices.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, the Agreement will include a timeframe for establishment of plantations which provide for a long-term timber supply with the object of phasing out woodchip export through value-adding. This will relieve pressure on native forests.
      </para>
      <para>
       She concludes:
      </para>
      <para>
       With these safeguards in place, I am confident that the forest industries and conservation needs can be met and that the industry-
      </para>
      <para>
       that is the forest industry-
      </para>
      <para>
       will move to a secure, ecologically sustainable footing.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suppose what many people would ask is: what guarantees are there in relation to the conservation needs? Conservationists and their national organisations are perhaps predictably sceptical of these very well-meaning and earnest assurances. I do not want to denigrate them in any way because I believe the Minister has worked very hard to gain these guarantees. But I think that many people committed to environmental protection are sceptical simply because they fear that legislation in itself may preclude the kind of flexibility that ministerial negotiation and discretion could offer.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am sure that honourable senators have all been in the situation of taking a particular constituency case to a department or a Minister and being told absolutely genuinely, `Look, there is a case. There is an anomaly. We regret there is nothing we can do about it, but the legislation says and the legislation cannot predict for all contingencies'. We have all had that experience in relation to the necessary rigidity, I suppose, of legislative frameworks. I can understand very much the concerns of conservationists.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) has put forward in its submissions to the Resource Assessment Commission detailed proposals for an ecologically and sustainable forest industry including a transition strategy. The ACF argues that:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . resource security works against such a transition strategy, central to which must be an effective restructuring of the industry. By simply concentrating on the issue of security of access to native forest across the board, governments are in danger of ignoring the other problems faced by industry. Providing resource security in the form demanded by the timber industry runs the risk of entrenching restrictive and inefficient industry practices at a time when there is need for dynamic change through restructuring. Despite existing guarantees of access to public forest resources (such as the Tasmanian timber concession system and 15-year Victorian timber licences) the hardwood sawmilling industry has declined economically with major job loss, has been slow readjusting to further processing, and has been accompanied by the growth in a Third World style export woodchip industry that is economically and ecologically unacceptable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, the ACF concludes:
      </para>
      <para>
       Currently no forestry commission selling wood from native forests is making a commercially reasonable dividend payment to the community, the owner of the resource. Nor has there been an adequate evaluation of non-timber values of this public forest resource.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, in summing up it says:
      </para>
      <para>
       To go ahead with legislating for resource security, government will be issuing long term contracts to industry in the knowledge that log prices are too low and that a market system has not been established to price, allocate and freely trade the resource.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is very much putting the views of some of the conservation movement and, in particular, the ACF.
      </para>
      <para>
       Clearly, there are two eminently reasonable positions: firstly, what the Minister has given in her assurances and, secondly, what the ACF has given us in summary. These conflicting interpretations must be resolved. Over the coming months we are going to need extensive and logical debate between Government and the environment movement to ensure that the proposed legislation does in fact offer as much ecological security as it does resource security. Some people will argue that that is an impossible goal. They will argue that we cannot legislate for that ideal. However, I believe that it is a goal that we all have a responsibility to pursue with considerable vigour.
      </para>
      <para>
       While I can understand the frustration and the uncertainty of dedicated organisations like Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society in rejecting proposed resource security legislation, I personally very much hope that the Australian Conservation Foundation will remain committed to working in close collaboration with Government to guarantee that the framing of any legislation is balanced and in no way compromises what has been for this Government an outstanding record on the environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government, I believe, needs the Australian Conservation Foundation to continue its very rational and informed input into the debate that is going to ensue. It would be a tragedy if the ACF were to bail out. I can understand from its point of view that that may well be on its mind but it would be a very short term response and in the long term it would be a decision it would regret. Certainly, as a member of the Government, I would regret it and I think that Australians generally would regret it for many years to come.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally this evening I want to sum up some agreements that have been made following the announcement of the industry statement on the proposed resource security legislation. The Government has given an absolute assurance that a caucus committee will be established to liaise with Ministers responsible prior to and during the course of preparation of any legislation. The working group will canvass the broad range of issues in relation to resource security, and one of the first matters that has been put on the table as a result of efforts by a number of my colleagues is a call for the introduction of endangered species legislation to ensure that the Commonwealth Government has a mechanism to put into effect part five of stage three of the development process, that is, safeguards to accommodate major unforeseeable contingencies, for example, rare and endangered species.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will also be moving to ensure that the legislation complies with the principle that there be strictly enforced provision for the establishment of plantations in a specific time frame in order to facilitate the rapid reservation of native forests of high conservation value and a phasing out of woodchip exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will also be ensuring in discussions that attention is given to the importance of phasing out reliance on the logging of old growth native forests and that accordingly there will be some form of taper over a period of time in any resource guarantee so that there is a practical and effective incentive for companies to comply with this strategy.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have every confidence that this is a process that can achieve what both sides of the debate want to see achieved in the coming months. It is going to require a great deal of patience, commitment and open mindedness from both the environment movement and indeed from the Government. It is not going to be easy but I am sure that with goodwill on both sides and particularly, as I would like to emphasise, with the Australian Conservation Foundation remaining on board in this critical debate, a good outcome can in fact be negotiated.

        —Two days have now elapsed since the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made his final fling to restore the credibility of his Government. Judging by the poor reception Mr Hawke's statement has received from business, most sections of the media and many other groups in the community, not the least are the conservation groups as raised by Senator Reynolds this evening, it is clear that Mr Hawke failed in his task. Rather than restoring the economic credentials of his Government, Mr Hawke has in fact confirmed the worst fears of business men and women and the families of Australia. This Government is a government of special interests and of special deals with its mates. It has no capacity to take the decisions which will restore Australian prosperity, and with it our national pride and self-respect.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This evening Senator Chapman and Senator Panizza outlined, I thought rather well, the enormous restraint which this Government has on its decision-making as a result of its relationship with the trade union movement, and they are obviously very indebted to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) for confirming their views and the views of all people on this side of the chamber.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also thought Senator Alston in his speech made a similar point very well. `This Government', he said, `has tried to tackle the issue of economic reform with one arm tied behind its back'. The Government's arm, of course, is tied by the trade union bosses, who prevented a clear commitment and timetable for shipping reform, labour market reform, reductions in government spending, a proper privatisation program of government business enterprises and, among other things, the replacement of the wholesale sales tax regime by a consumption tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Conservation Foundation was mentioned at some length this evening by Senator Reynolds, and I can understand why she wants it to stay on board. If she accepts the view that has been promoted by Senator Richardson, having the Conservation Foundation on board was probably the main reason why at least Senator Richardson believed she and her colleagues are over on the other side of chamber. I am not so sure that Senator Richardson is right, but that was certainly the belief he had.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is interesting that Senator Reynolds believes that the Australian Conservation Foundation can be brought back on board. Certainly the Conservation Foundation believes that Mr Hawke broke his clear promise and commitment on resource security. A lot of us may ask why Phillip Toyne should be surprised. What is surprising is that Phillip Toyne and the Australian Conservation Foundation believed the Prime Minister would keep his word.
      </para>
      <para>
       Remember the Prime Minister's many promises in the elections during the 1980s? All major election promises on the economy have been broken. We were promised lower taxes and lower interest rates. Does Senator Reynolds remember his famous phrase in 1983? Mr Hawke said there would be no capital gains tax. Again, that was probably one of the early major promises that Mr Hawke broke. As we go through election after election, we cannot forget the famous big lie of them all, the daddy of them all. In 1987 he said, `No child will live in poverty'.
      </para>
      <para>
       So why, I ask, is Phillip Toyne surprised that the Prime Minister has broken his promise to the Australian Conservation Foundation? He broke his promises to the families and the children of Australia.

He went around saying, `There will be no recession'. Senator Sherry said that, I am sure, and so did Senator West and Senator Faulkner.

       Mr Hawke and Mr Keating used to tell us that they were not like the Whitlam Government. In fact, they used to go around bagging the Whitlam Government. They were not going to be bad managers of the economy, like the Whitlam Government. We do not hear much of that talk now, do we? We do not hear much of that talk at all. Along with their failed mates-and we can list the role of dishonour: Bourke, Dowding, Lawrence, Cain, Kirner, Field and Bannon; the list mounts up-one would have to say that Hawke and Keating are indeed the true descendants of the Whitlam Government. In fact, Gough looks almost good by comparison. He never had a foreign debt of $130 billion. Senator Richardson always used to go around bagging him, and certainly he made some gross mistakes, but Senator Richardson's Government is chalking up a Gough-like record.

      <para>
       This evening my colleagues have made some very important criticisms of the March economic statement. I will concentrate my remarks on what has been described today by the Australian Financial Review as `the missing link' in the economic statement. I refer to the failure to reform the indirect taxation system. Today's Australian Financial Review said:
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that the present indirect taxation system is hugely inefficient. Since its introduction in 1931 it has spawned a veritable industry of corporate lawyers and accountants who have spent endless hours doing battle with the Government in and out of various courts, over loopholes and anomalies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Financial Review criticised Mr Keating for attempting to prop up the failed wholesale tax system and praised Dr Hewson for his brave support of a consumption tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we want to find out how Australian industry is being crippled by bureaucracy, red tape and absurd tax laws, we need look no further than the wholesale sales tax regime. It is true that this tax is a nightmare for companies in its complexity. The proposals announced yesterday in the economic statement, while providing some relief, will, if anything, add to the confusion, bureaucracy and inequities resulting from wholesale sales taxes. Further, delaying the date of implementation until August will cause serious disruption to manufacturers and distortions in the market for a variety of goods.
      </para>
      <para>
       The anomalies, exceptions and absurdities of the current wholesale tax system can be illustrated by reference to innumerable examples. As the hour is late and we are all keen to go home, I propose to refer to just one particular example. It is an example that was raised by Senator Spindler in his speech this evening: the problem of recycled paper products. We can all support the use of recycled paper products. I am sure that all of us do-on each side of the chamber. A minute from the Australian Taxation Office has come into my hands which seeks to explain how the sales tax applies to recycled paper products. This minute exposes the absurdities and anomalies of the current system and testifies to the confusion it has caused among the Department's own officers and, by implication, industry at large.
      </para>
      <para>
       This minute shows how the Australian Taxation Office interprets the Government's regulations relating to these products. The Office was therefore moved to issue a lengthy minute in an attempt to clear up the confusion about the exceptions and exclusions which apply. As the minute shows, the harder one tries to rationalise the indirect wholesale sales tax system the greater is the confusion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Not all recycled paper products are exempt from the 20 per cent tax. Where the product has considerable value added to it by printing or some other process the product will not be exempt. How does this work out in fact? Let us take the simple first case. Recycled paper is tax exempt. Recycled paper with lines on it is tax exempt. For the same paper with lines on but with a company logo and some shading-voila, a 20 per cent tax. Recycled paper product companies should beware. If they put a company logo or trademark in solid print and shading over a section of the recycled paper they cop a 20 per cent tax. If the recycled paper merely has lines on it there is no tax, but put a floral design on that same piece of paper and, that is right, Mr Keating taxes them at 20 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       Apparently various branches of the Taxation Office were giving different advice on this complex matter of recycled paper products. For example, in some cases if the recycled paper had a trademark and a logo, exemption was not granted by some offices. However, if the manufacturer was lucky he may have obtained advice from another Tax Office which suggested that recycled paper with a trademark and a logo was exempt. If the Taxation Office is confused, think of the poor producer of the paper.
      </para>
      <para>
       Envelopes are covered by the same principles. An inter-office envelope on recycled paper would be taxable because of the squares printed across it. Envelopes that now provide squares in which to enter a postcode are, however, exempt. What is the reason for this exemption? Squares on an envelope for the purpose of postcodes are considered to be part of the address, not part of the envelope. The anomaly is, once again, absurd. An inter-office envelope, even when it is printed on new paper, is designed to conserve paper-yet it is taxed. I am advised by some tax experts that last night's statement does nothing to clear up the confusion surrounding the use of recycled paper and the indirect taxes that apply to it. Indeed, it may well add to the problems that recycled paper producers now have.
      </para>
      <para>
       The absurdities and anomalies of the wholesale sales tax provisions do not stop at recycled paper products. In almost every other category of product-and there are hundreds of them-any one manufacturer can be faced with the difficulties and exceptions of a large number of provisions of the relevant Act in the course of his business. All of these categories come under continual change and review as the bureaucratic red tape seeks to embrace new products, create new exemptions, and as a consequence create further and more profound uncertainty.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Opposition offered bipartisan support for a comprehensive reform of the indirect tax system. The Treasurer is on record as supporting a consumption tax but, as we know and as history records, this was vetoed by Bill Kelty. When the Government has to choose between Australia's interests and the interests of the trade union movement, Australia loses every time. Australia is the big loser from Mr Hawke's economic statement.

        —Mr Hawke in his industry statement on Tuesday missed the point so badly that he could be likened to a snooker player who forgets to chalk his cue, does not know how to bridge his fingers, and in pulling back his cue hits the black ball. Tuesday was a black day for Australia: so much promised, so much needed, but ending in an unfulfilled dream. The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), so eloquently called Building a Competitive Australia, I have to say is much ado about nothing. We are getting quite used to this Government doing its patchwork quilt routine six months or so after every budget it brings down. It seems to have become a hallmark of how this Government runs things. What a weaver it is, weaving the threads of economic despair for Australia, which started eight years ago and is continuing to this very day.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Given its abysmal record of managing the economy, it is little wonder it needs to resort to these mid-term reports to try to ginger up the troops. Having seen the glossy publication produced for the Prime Minister, one has to ask: why did he bother? Clearly, the statement has done nothing for the man in the street. It most certainly has done nothing for rural Australia and has wasted a few more forests in producing the paperwork. As Senator Kemp has already said, there is nothing to be done abut the recycling of it.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not just the Opposition parties which suggest that it has been very much a flop. Scanning through the various headlines and editorials following the statement, one can soon see how it has been received. An article by Max Walsh was headlined, `Hawke muffs it in late bid for salvation'. In the article he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Too little, too late, will be the epitaph of the Hawke Government. This weeks package of industry measures fits that description. So, too, does the Government's belated conversion to privatisation, whose policy evolution has been so long and agonising that it is being implemented in the worst possible market environment on a half-baked basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       The same criticism of ` `too little, too late'' can be directed, as the Prime Minister conceded in his speech on Tuesday, to the Government's operation of monetary policy. And there is the glacial rate of progress towards a genuinely flexible wages system-and every other aspect of micro-economic reform that involves any possibility of disagreement with organised labour.
      </para>
      <para>
       Barry Jones had a bit to say, too. He is one of the ex-Ministers in the Hawke Labor Government. According to a press report, he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       And the Hawke Government's industry statement had shown ``unusual bravery'' but was eight years too late in tackling the problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       He went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``unless we get a culture shift we're not going to make it . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       That is really what was meant to happen in the Prime Minister's statement on Tuesday. He was meant to give some indication of where Australia was going. He was meant to give some indication of what was needed from Australia to make it get off its backside and really get going. The Australian, in its editorial, states:
      </para>
      <para>
       A competitive Hawke fails his own test.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister's industry statement yesterday is in keeping with this Government's record: audacious reforms to the business environment are coupled with a marked reluctance to force change upon Labor's allies-the trade union movement and, as it turns out, the greens.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Canberra Times states, `Many ingredients but no cake'. Another editorial states, `More faith and hope than charity'. Then we go to the Sydney Morning Herald, which states, `Together we're all prepared-for trouble'. That was by Alan Ramsey. Here we have the Hawke Labor Government, which promised so much to Australia, promised us something to get things going, and has given us absolutely nothing. Many of the people who wrote those editorials and who made those comments in the newspapers a few years ago were saying that the Hawke Labor Government was doing a good job, although I do not think it was. They have now turned because the Hawke Labor Government has failed Australia. It is hardly a vote of confidence from those in the press gallery.
      </para>
      <para>
       I quite agree with Alan Ramsey and all the editorial writers, who have deserted the Hawke Labor Government. `Crook' was the word that Alan Ramsey used and it is probably as good a word as any other to describe rural Australia at the present time. When farm incomes are likely to fall 67 per cent, when wheat growers are losing up to something like 94 per cent of last year's income and woolgrowers are losing at least half their income, one could suggest that things are crook. The Prime Minister prefers to suggest:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . rural Australia in particular is experiencing a very tough period.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wish to hell the Prime Minister would go out and have a look at what is happening in rural Australia and how he is closing country Australia down. Madam Acting Deputy President, you know what is happening in Queensland and I know what is happening in the country areas of New South Wales. This Prime Minister, his Treasurer (Mr Keating) and this Government are absolutely crucifying the Australian community. This statement that rural Australia in particular is experiencing a very tough period comes from a Prime Minister who, only a few months ago, was denying that things were even tough in the rural areas. I guess it is some concession that he is saying it now.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given that the Prime Minister has now acknowledged things are tough, farmers could be excused for being angry and disappointed that this statement contains nothing for them. In fact, worse than not giving any assistance, the Prime Minister says:
      </para>
      <para>
       General agricultural assistance will be reduced in line with the pace of tariff reform in manufacturing.
      </para>
      <para>
       For wheat growers there is nothing. They are obviously going to be allowed to go the same way as the woolgrowers of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator West is sitting in the chamber. She is supposed to represent and to help country people. Sitting in the city of Orange, what is she doing about trying to get this monolith of a Prime Minister of hers to do something, especially for country New South Wales? It is time Senator West did something in her Party to make sure that the rural industries of Australia have a bit of a fair go.
      </para>
      <para>
       Obviously, the Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls survey-one would think that the Government would have taken a bit of notice of the survey because the pollster has done a lot of work for the Australian Labor Party-and the paper that it put out recently to tell of the problems in the rural areas and the Agricultural Outlook Conference all fell on deaf ears. The rural sector is to get nothing. In fact, it is getting less than nothing because this Hawke-Keating Labor Government, of which Senator Bolkus is a part, has given nothing to rural Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government is effectively giving export incentives to our comparatively inefficient manufacturing sector while refusing to give any similar boost to our efficient and wealth generating rural industries. Agriculture is virtually unprotected and is trying to compete against increasingly corrupted world marketing practices. Yet the Prime Minister says that general agricultural assistance is to be reduced in line with the pace of tariff reform in manufacturing. This is absolutely disgraceful. Those sitting on that side of the chamber who can see the damage being done to rural Australia can hang their heads in shame for what is happening.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is only through increased agricultural and mineral exports that Australia's precarious and worsening balance of payments problems will improve. But that point seems to have repeatedly escaped the notice of the Prime Minister, his Deputy, the Cabinet and all the other people on the other side of the chamber.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where are the initiatives to boost the export competitiveness of our products? If the Government is happy to reduce the tax burden on business inputs, it should at least have gone a step further and included rebates on the excise of fuels used in agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining. It is hardly a new concept; it is one for which those industries have been pressing for a very long time.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister's statement uses all the right words. It talks of challenges and refers again to Australia becoming the clever country, working smarter and not harder. What do all those glib statements mean? As Michelle Grattan in the Age suggested, the Hawke statement has fallen victim to its own hype. As she says, the statement was supposed to revitalise the political fortunes of the Government and revive business confidence but `it is hard to see it doing any of these'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why is that? It is because we still have the most inefficient waterfront in the world; because it is still cheaper to ship a container halfway around the world than to freight it across the Tasman. We still have industries bogged down with the unnecessary work and pay structures that prevent them from becoming efficient; for example, we still have people getting more on holidays than they do when actually working. We still have high interest rates that have just about wiped out small business across Australia, and we still have a recession with 600,000 people out of work and more on the way.
      </para>
      <para>
       If Government members can smile and feel happy about that, sitting on that side of this chamber, they should hang their heads in shame once again. All this, and the Prime Minister suggests that during his Government's eight years in office we have made `substantial progress'. If this is progress, Australia definitely does not need it. The Prime Minister's statement smacks of hypocrisy from beginning to end. It is, and could only ever have been, a political stunt because this Government does not really believe Australia is suffering. After all, we needed this recession. I cannot remember if I ever knew why it was we needed it, but according to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister we did.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has never been any commitment to real reform. In its eight years in office, the Government would have done better to write its Budgets in pencil because for every Budget there has been a counter-Budget or a supplementary Budget. Ask the motor industry. The Government's on-again, off-again tax on cars has sent that industry into collapse, with some 18,000 jobs axed in car dealerships across Australia during the last two years.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are another couple of reforms that could have been made. Why has Coronation Hill not come into production? Why has something not been done about the three mines uranium policy, with Canada stealing all the uranium markets of the world while Australia has the biggest reserves; with Canada getting billions of dollars in return for its uranium and Australia getting something like $0.4 billion? I will stop now because I believe there are others who want to speak tonight, and I know that we are trying to finish this debate. I will quote just one little statement:

        —The statements presented by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Mr Button) have been criticised in a number of areas: by the environment movement in respect of the resource security legislation; and by those opposite in respect of the alleged failure to transform our waterfront, trans-Tasman shipping, our railroads and other aspects of our transport system, and in respect of industrial relations and the lack of a consumption tax. Tonight I intend to deal with a couple of these matters, particularly resource legislation and industrial relations. In terms of the resource legislation, I would firstly like to conclude some remarks that I commenced earlier in the week when the Australian Democrats proposed a matter of urgency motion concerning the forestry industry which was based on the accurate, as it proved, media speculation about the statements containing proposals for resource legislation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The genesis of the proposal for resource guarantee legislation emerged from Tasmania where, over the last two years, the Field Labor Government in that State has completed an extensive research into all aspects of Tasmanian forest industry-the Tasmanian Forests and Forest Industry Strategy, as the report has become known. One of the important aspects about this issue of resource guarantee legislation, which appears to have been missed by most persons who have commented on the matter in the last couple of weeks, is the issue of the concession system in Tasmania which will be replaced by the resource guarantee legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Tasmania for the last 50 years, there has been a system of concessions operating, five in number, which are established under individual Acts of the Tasmanian Parliament. The rights offered under the concession Acts vary, but the general theme is of conveying exclusive rights to pulpwood from a specified area under specified conditions. In reality, of course, the forestry companies who were granted these concessions were given almost carte blanche to operate, to pulp the wood in whatever way they saw fit-although there have been some extensive changes in the last decade. In return for these concessions, they had to offer to establish a manufacturing facility to utilise that pulpwood.
      </para>
      <para>
       There were some five concession Acts. The first, the Wood Pulp and Paper Industry Encouragement Act, was passed in 1926 at the same time as the building of the current mill at Burnie. There then followed some four other concession Acts and, if we look at a map showing the concession areas in Tasmania-unlike Senator Shirley Walters, who had a visual aid in the Senate on Tuesday when debating this matter, my map is somewhat smaller and I cannot display it to all the honourable senators present-we find that it shows that access to pulpwood in almost two-thirds of the State was granted to forestry companies in Tasmania. Those companies had access to almost two-thirds of the State. In fact, they had a resource guarantee of monumental proportions with very few controls.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the negotiating points that emerged in the forest industry strategy in Tasmania was that those companies agreed that the concession Acts should end and that the land that had been vested under their control should be passed back to the control of the State Government. However, if they are to pass back the lands that they were granted through these concession Acts, it is quite reasonable for those companies to require some sort of resource security guarantee as to the resources they currently need and the resources that they will need to operate a new pulp and paper mill that is proposed for north-west Tasmania.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although there has been considerable media speculation and hype, it has certainly become apparent that the process outlined in the statement of the Prime Minister is extremely comprehensive in terms of the issues that will be required to be addressed through this resource guarantee legislation. The comprehensive proposals from the States-and obviously Tasmania will be the first to be considered-will have to provide for economically feasible hardwood and softwood plantations in agreed areas and with agreed time frames. There will need to be required consideration of the environmental, cultural, social, economic and heritage issues, and these need to be designed and comprehensively identified.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also, forest management prescriptions for both public and private forests will need to be encompassed in codes of forest practice. There will need to be provision for periodic review of the operation of management and environmental protection practices under the agreement. There will need to be safeguards to accommodate major unforeseen contingencies-for example, rare and endangered species. So if we look through that statement of the Prime Minister, we find that it is quite clear that a lot of the media hype and statements, particularly from some sections of the environmental movement, were somewhat overstated.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also in respect of the forest industry strategy that was developed in Tasmania by a State Labor government and which has not been supported by the State Liberal Party over the last decade, in early 1988 some 16 per cent of the area of Tasmania was vested either as national parks or World Heritage area. By 1989, after the Helsham and Salamanca agreements, some 25 per cent of Tasmania was vested in World Heritage and national parks areas. After September 1990, following the completion of the forest industry strategy, some 27 per cent of Tasmania was vested in World Heritage and national parks areas. Some 16 per cent of Tasmania will become wood production forest. This area will be specified as a resource for the paper industry in Tasmania. Some 9 per cent will be deferred as forest that will require some further examination. A comprehensive strategy will be developed and will be presented to the Federal Government in terms of the resource guarantee legislation. Every conceivable factor-the interests of the workers, the environment and the pulp and paper producers-will be taken into account.

       The second issue I wish to comment on in regard to the Government's industry statements relates to employment, education and training. A number of very important new initiatives were outlined. I will touch on a couple of them. For example, in regard to research awards, the number of annual postgraduate research awards is to be increased from 1,100 to 1,300 and the number of overseas postgraduate research scholarships will be doubled to around 300 awards a year from the 1992 academic year. There are to be incentives for training and management skills development. Regrettably, management skills development has been sorely neglected in this country. Honourable senators opposite maintain a continual and quite unjustified barrage of criticism against the union movement and workers in this country for alleged malpractices. However, if we examine management skills and practices in this country, we see that they need change as well.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has announced a national management skills formation strategy that will be developed to include research to identify the need for management skills. The measures will also improve education and advisory services and strengthen the links between training providers and employers.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the area of industrial relations, the new workplace culture, the Australian best practice demonstration program, will identify on a competitive basis enterprises in the process of successfully implementing workplace reform. The achievements of these enterprises will be widely published to encourage other firms to adopt the new workplace culture. These are the types of new strategies in the area of employment, education and training. Of course, these follow a long series of initiatives by this Government over the last eight years to boost the skill of Australian workers and, therefore, to boost the productivity and output of our Australian economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Measures such as the training guarantee legislation, restructuring of higher education and incentives to ensure that there are greater retention rates in Australian educational institutions are just a few of the measures taken by this Government over the last eight years under the auspices of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr John Dawkins. They provide a useful example of the way in which the Australian Labor Party has taken a positive approach to restructuring our economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       I come next to the area of industrial relations. It is an area of much rhetoric from honourable senators opposite. They have called, as they usually do, for the introduction of enterprise agreements, for the freeing up of the labour market and for negotiations between employees and employers. However, when we examine the evidence that has emerged on this issue as to whether, in fact, that is what employers are interested in, we find that employers quite frankly are just not interested in what the Opposition is proposing.
      </para>
      <para>
       The recently released Australian workplace industrial relations survey provides clear evidence of the sorts of issues that employers are interested in discussing in terms of workplace reform. If we look at the conclusions of this extremely comprehensive survey, we see that the vast majority of employers are not interested in renegotiating or abolishing awards. If we look at the survey we see that some 60 per cent of private employers said that there need not be any changes to awards in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we look at the issues which they were interested in examining, such as the introduction of career paths, performance pay, increased pay, fewer awards and changed award classifications, we see that they are all initiatives that the Labor Government has under way in the area of labour market reform. The evidence clearly shows that what the Opposition is postulating and pushing, the employers themselves are simply not interested in.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other area I wish to touch on this evening is the important area of Federal-State relationships in terms of improving our nation's productivity and improving our economy. Again, there is one State in this country that had a predominantly Liberal Government over the last decade, and that is Tasmania. If that Government provides evidence of the sorts of policies that are to be initiated by those opposite, then those opposite should be ashamed of themselves.
      </para>
      <para>
       We can look at what occurred in Tasmania over the last eight years under the Gray Government. The State was almost left bankrupt; it makes the running of Victoria look like quite responsible fiscal management. Those opposite ought to go down there and see what the Liberal Government has done to the State. Let us look at what it did to Tasmania when it comes to these issues of structural reform.
      </para>
      <para>
       First of all, the Liberal Government in Tasmania does not have a forest industry strategy. It rejected the forest industry strategy that has been negotiated, which the industry itself supports. But, no, that Government has rejected it. In the area of local government restructuring-as far as the Liberal Party of Australia is concerned, that is some sort of centralist, socialist plot to combine local government.
      </para>
      <para>
       We can look at the issue of hospital rationalisation in Tasmania. There are two hospitals on the north-western coast of Tasmania-one in the Devonport- Latrobe area and one in Burnie-both operating at 50 per cent capacity. Of course, the State Labor Government, in terms of making State government more efficient by delivering a better health service, has decided that one of those hospitals has to be downgraded. What is the attitude of the Liberal Party? It wants to maintain two hospitals, both operating on 50 per cent capacity, which is an extravagant waste of public resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are half-empty schools in Tasmania all over the place, and when the Labor Government proposed to rationalise the schools, the Liberal Party jumped into bed with the green movement and passed legislation to ensure that there could be no school closures in Tasmania. It must be the only place in the world where one cannot close a school.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Tasmania there is a petrol rostering system which restricts and controls the way petrol is sold. The Labor Government in Tasmania proposed to abolish this petrol rostering system. But what did the Liberal Party do? One would think that it would be very keen on ensuring free trade occurred in the petrol rostering area; but no, again it jumped into bed with the greens and it refused to abolish the petrol rostering system.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to shop trading hours, Tasmania is the only place in Australia where we do not have shops open on Saturday afternoons. One would think that the Liberal Party-this Party which is in favour of free enterprise and removing restrictions-would be supporting this initiative; but no, it jumped into bed with the greens yet again and it refused to amend the shop trading hours. What a crew we have down in Tasmania. Yet the Tasmanian senators have the gall to come up here and postulate the sorts of theories they have put forward, when the clear evidence shows that the Liberal Party has been an abysmal failure in Tasmania.
      </para>
      <para>
       In terms of this debate, one of the interesting hallmarks is that those opposite have talked about, in their usual rhetoric, such words as `flexibility', `productivity' and `freedom of choice'. They have talked about `removing the shackles and the chains'. They are into rhetoric. They have even invented a new word- `incentivation'. That is how much they are into rhetoric.
      </para>
      <para>
       When it comes to addressing the structural problems of this country that we have inherited over 180 years-and which were compounded by those opposite for 30 years under the Menzies regime-this Government is the only one that has addressed them. We cannot sweep away all our problems in 10 years, but we have had a good go. This Government is about hard work; it is about hard, effective, coordinated policies. It is about fact, not about fiction; it is about cooperation, not about confrontation; it is about reason, not about the rhetoric we get from those opposite; it is about success, not about failure-and that is what those opposite will learn.

        <para in-line="1">
         —Last Tuesday I asked in this chamber a question relating to the enterprise based agreement that has been negotiated with the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia by National Terminals (Australia) Ltd. My question referred to a speech by Julian Manser, the Chief Executive of National Terminals, which he had addressed to the waterfront, ports and shipping conference in February this year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I asked the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) whether he was aware that Julian Manser could not see any reductions in charges to waterfront use as a result of the enterprise agreements. I then asked: if the savings were not going to flow to the users of the waterfront, what was the purpose of the Government's reforms? In his answer Minister Collins indicated that Julian Manser had been misquoted by the National Farmers Federation, by the Australian shippers users group, by the shadow Minister, John Sharp, and by me. He said that what Julian Manser had actually said was:
       </para>
       <para>
        The savings that will be achieved on the waterfront in the National Terminals agreement will not be passed on to users if those savings are simply eroded by increases in charges levied by State-controlled port authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I asked the question, I had Mr Manser's speech with me and I knew that he was not referring to port charges when he said that it might not be possible to pass the cost on to users. Therefore, I asked the Minister a supplementary question and indicated that the costs referred to by Julian Manser were, in fact, the costs of multiskilling, retraining, and investment in new technology. In answer to the supplementary question, the Minister said that the multiskilling program that was being introduced into National Terminals substantially would produce a great deal of productivity that was going to be delivered as a result of the National Terminals agreement. However, he refused to say more than that and failed to give any response to other costs involved in the enterprise agreement. Instead, the Minister said that he would send me a copy of Julian Manser's speech, which he subsequently did. Actually, I already had the speech and I was fully acquainted with all of its contents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because the answer provided by the Minister was so unsatisfactory and had failed to address my question, I again asked whether Julian Manser had actually said that cost savings created by reductions in manning levels on the wharves would be offset-and I now quote Mr Manser:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . by the cost of reclassification of positions with multi-skills which will cost in the region of 8 per cent of payroll, plus significant costs of retraining and multi-skilling employees. Additionally our investment program in new equipment and technology will incur significant financial costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the information of honourable senators, I indicate that this quote comes from the final paragraph on page 12 of Mr Manser's speech. I finally asked why the Minister had misled the Senate on the previous day. In his answer, Senator Collins indicated that I had not read far enough in the speech and that I had not read the next paragraph. However, this time he did answer part of my question-that part which related to investment-and quoted the investment costs of upgrading the port facilities in Sydney. The Minister finally quoted Julian Manser again when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The long term benefits that will be given to users from all this cumulative effect and the investment the company is putting in will be eroded and lost to the users if they are simply picked up by opportunistic lifts in port authority pricing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Incidentally, that particular quotation is nowhere to be found in Mr Manser's speech, which was tabled by the Minister. In a supplementary question I acknowledged the problem of State port charges for ship users, but it is, of course, a quite separate problem from the one which I was attempting to clarify with the Minister. Again I asked about the fact that the very high cost of implementing the enterprise agreement and the Government's reforms, including increased idle time and the extremely generous redundancy packages, would prevent any financial gain for some time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister did not answer the question. Instead, he subjected the Senate to a lecture about redundancy schemes for politicians. I understand that there are no redundancy schemes for politicians. There is in fact a parliamentary retirement benefits scheme, which has absolutely nothing to do with the redundancy packages for surplus labour on wharves.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Minister could not or would not answer the question. I have been asking it now over two days. He simply tabled Mr Manser's speech and left honourable senators to make up their own minds about its accuracy. So that honourable senators will be in no doubt about the accuracy or non-accuracy of the Minister, let me inform you, Mr Deputy President, that I am now dealing only with the copy of the speech tabled by the Minister, which I obtained from the Table Office. It is identical to the speech which I used as the basis for all the questions I asked in the Senate on Tuesday and Wednesday.

        <para in-line="1">
         —I think the Senate should judge that for itself. First, I refer all honourable senators to the final paragraph on page 12, which I have already quoted, referring to the offsetting costs of reclassification, retraining, multiskilling and investment. In the Minister's answer on Wednesday he referred me to the next paragraph of the answer, which he kept repeating: savings in reduction of manpower on the wharves would be eroded by port charges.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may not be surprised to find that the next paragraph, which comes at the top of page 13 of the tabled document, has nothing whatsoever to do with State port charges. In his speech, Mr Manser was outlining to the conference the process by which National Terminals had formed the enterprise agreement and the problems and costs related to the next stage of implementation of the agreement. Only at the very end of his speech did he make a passing reference to port charges, although not in relation to the cost of implementation of the agreement but as another area for future reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know as well as the Minister does that State port charges are a problem. The Australian National Line made a special point of that in its latest annual report, which states in relation to the unsatisfactory situation on the wharves:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . has been exacerbated by the Port Authorities in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle implementing major increases in their port pricing charges without adequate consultation with port users.
       </para>
       <para>
        Julian Manser substantiates this when he says on page 14 of his speech:
       </para>
       <para>
        it occurs to me that the recent changes to Port Pricing Policies have highlighted one of the areas where significant opportunities exist for further reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        This leads me to believe that the next stage in Waterfront Reform must be a review of Port Authorities of equal intensity to that experienced by the stevedoring industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not deny that, and I would support a review of port authorities and their pricing policies. But that was not the issue in my questions on Tuesday or Wednesday; nor is it the issue of greatest concern in the waterfront industry reform strategy and enterprise based agreements.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is of concern are the costs of negotiating and implementing the reforms. Yes, there will be a saving eventually to users when new rosters and productivity improvements eventuate. But what Julian Manser said quite categorically on page 12 was `It is too early to be estimating tariff rate reductions', although he assures users that any financial benefits the industry derives will be passed on to users because of market pressure. I recommend Julian Manser's speech to the Senate for careful perusal. Honourable senators will find it very revealing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The enterprise based agreements negotiated by National Terminals (Australia) Ltd with the waterfront unions have been long and tortuous. Let me briefly outline to the Senate the steps by which the agreement was reached as Julian Manser set them out in his speech. By February 1991 National Terminals had had 100 meetings with the unions and it had achieved a signed document of over 200 pages. That document represents the final enterprise agreement. The National Terminals enterprise agreement was approved by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority in December last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Implementation commenced finally at the end of January when the agreed ship manning levels and work practices were adopted. Note the word `adopted', not `implemented'. It was admitted that the agreed manning levels would not be implemented for some months while training and multiskilling were progressively introduced. In fact, Julian Manser said that in the early stages there would be an actual increase in idle time while the surpluses in the work force were identified. In mid-February Mr Manser thought that the surplus labour would be removed to the transitory labour lists or removed from the industry under the Government's redundancy package. Nothing further happens until March 1992, when negotiations will occur to decide the future of those employees who are on the transitory labour lists.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, despite the much vaunted statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about the two enterprise based agreements achieved to date, nothing has really happened, and the Minister knows nothing has happened. All that National Terminals has is a document, and it faces very significant costs, as I have pointed out during the past two days-the costs of reclassification, retraining and multiskilling as well as the investment in new technology and new equipment.
       </para>
       <para>
        To make the point very clearly, let me quote again from the latest annual report of the wholly Government-owned Australian National Line:
       </para>
       <para>
        By comparison with the progress of shipping reform, criticism of the pace of waterfront reform is justified.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a major Australian ship-operator ANL's shipping competitiveness continues to be seriously handicapped by waterfront inefficiencies. Waterfront costs constitute 50%-60% of total door-to-door shipping costs on the short, but important, sea routes, e.g. Bass Strait and the Tasman.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now its own subsidiary, National Terminals (Australia), has told it quite categorically that it cannot expect any relief in the short term.

        <para>
         During debate on 20 February on a motion to take note of a statement I had made in response to a question by Senator Bishop relating to security arrangements at Parliament House, the honourable Senator referred to a number of additional matters to which I will now respond in turn.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Bishop expressed her concern that I had not been advised about a scuffle which occurred among the demonstrators at the front of Parliament House on Sunday, 17 February. The Australian Protective Service has reported that the incident involved two or three people engaged in a shouting match, which included bad language, and some pushing and shoving. I understand no punches were thrown. I do not believe that an incident of this nature warranted a special report to the Speaker and me.
        </para>
        <para>
         The duration of protests at Parliament House is not something over which I have control, neither would I wish to have control. My only concern is to ensure that protests are orderly and do not threaten injury to people or damage to property.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Bishop referred to the unrestricted access to the public underground carpark. While few restrictions can be effective in such a public area, the carpark is equipped with closed-circuit television monitors, is regularly patrolled and is subjected to a detailed search daily. Short of closing it down, I am satisfied that all prudent measures had been taken and continue to be taken to ensure its security.
        </para>
        <para>
         On the general subject of underground carparks it is worth noting that, following security advice during the design of this building, none of the carparks is under any part of Parliament House.
        </para>
        <para>
         As Senator Bishop has stated, I have been advised that six people connected with the anti-war demonstration spent part of the night of 21 January in the public underground carpark. They had initially sought to camp under the verandah at the main entrance because of the threat of rain. They were advised by the Australian Protective Service officer on duty that they could not sleep within the precincts.
        </para>
        <para>
         Honourable Senators will recall that impassioned anti-war demonstrations had occurred earlier in the day. In attempting to avoid further confrontation with the demonstrators, the officer advised the six people that in the event of rain they could shelter in the carpark. I accept that the officer's actions, while contrary to the guidelines, were reasonable in the circumstances. No one has been permitted to sleep in the carpark since that date. The Australian Protective Service has advised that demonstrators' goods and chattels have not been left unattended in the carpark.
        </para>
        <para>
         Australian Protective Service officers on duty at Parliament House are employed under an arrangement between the Presiding Officers and the Minister administering the Service. Pursuant to that arrangement, and in respect of the Australian Protective Service, the Speaker and I exercise our responsibility for the control and management of security in the precincts through the Security Controller. Because of the need for effective co-ordination of security arrangements among the Senate, House of Representatives and the Ministry and with the police and intelligence services, the Security Controller is well-placed to exercise control over the Protective Service officers on duty in the precincts. The Speaker and I receive regular reports from the Security Controller and we are immediately advised of any serious matters.
        </para>
        <para>
         There would appear to be some misunderstanding about the number of holding cells in Parliament House. I have stated previously that there are two. Provision was made in the original design of the building for an additional two cells in the basement of the Ministerial Wing. Construction of those cells was not completed. Those areas are without doors and could not be used as cells. They are currently used as an office and storage area.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Bishop also referred to an incident which involved a member of her staff who had parked a vehicle adjacent to the Senate entrance to the building. In my statement on 20 February, I said that the Speaker and I had accepted advice that vehicles should not be permitted to remain unattended in the immediate vicinity of the entrances to the building.
        </para>
        <para>
         Investigations have revealed that on 28 January a car was found to be parked at the Senate entrance contrary to the parking restrictions in force. The Parliamentary Security Attendant on duty immediately requested the security control room to arrange for a check of the vehicle's registration number. The Attendant recognised the name of the vehicle's owner to be the same as a person who had previously been signed into the building by a member of Senator Bishop's staff. A call to the Senator's office resulted in the vehicle being removed immediately.
        </para>
        <para>
         I wish to assure Senator Bishop that the normal course of action was followed in tracing the driver of the vehicle.
        </para>
        <para>
         These matters having been raised by Senator Bishop, I take the opportunity to advise the Senate that the Speaker and I, prior to the end of the 1990 Budget Sittings, approved a contingency plan which comprised a range of measures to be implemented in the event of increased levels of threat to Parliament House. Security of the building was increased following an assessment of increased threats stemming from Australia's involvement in the Gulf War.
        </para>
        <para>
         In tightening the security of the building, several valuable lessons have been learned about the efficacy of the security procedures. Given that experience, all procedures are to be reviewed and altered where necessary to improve their effectiveness in providing appropriate levels of security for Parliament House.

         —I am not going to respond to interjections, and if honourable senators opposite wish at a quarter past 12 in the morning, I will just stay here until I finish. Senator Tierney talked about arrangements that were part of the original process-which were, in fact, some of the `structural difficulties' that I identified with the process last year and which we have been successfully able to negotiate our way out of. Senator Tierney would have had no more firm an advocate of concern about the slowness of waterfront reform last year than me. I think I stated that at every industry function I publicly addressed in order to put the maximum pressure on the process.

        I need to identify very clearly, and it is not hard, the panic stricken reaction that the Opposition is delivering at the moment on waterfront reform for what it is. We had it again in the House of Representatives this evening from Mr Sharp, when he ran the piece of nonsense, for the fourth time, that the Conaust agreement, successful as it is-and, of course, that is the problem-when it is consummated will have been done outside the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority process, rather than inside.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the real difficulty is very clear indeed. The Opposition's position on waterfront reform is that it does not want it to succeed; it wants it to fail. Senator Macdonald, of course, over the last 12 months has been one of the greatest white ants of the process. The Opposition is not interested in the national good, it is not interested in any real productivity gains; it wants it to fall in a heap.

        As I said in the Senate the other day, there is a particular view in this country that really irritates me-and the Opposition is the foremost advocate of it-and that is this: if one goes into a negotiation with a union to get some improvements in the workplace, one does that as we have done with the shipping industry reform program-which everyone inside the industry acknowledges to me every time they see me as being spectacularly successful in terms of--

        What is the Opposition's benchmark of success in the maritime industry? I will tell honourable senators what it is. If we go into a negotiation process and get a 50 per cent improvement in productivity by negotiation without a stoush, without a day lost in industrial disputation, that is classified as a failure. But if one wants to get hairy-chested, take on the unions, have a brawl, and get 25 per cent, that would be classified as being a huge success because there has been a stoush with the unions. These people measure success in waterfront reform not by the number of extra containers lifted per hour but by the amount of union blood that is spilt on the wharf.

        As far as Senator Tierney's understanding of Julian Manser's speech is concerned, I will explain it to him in very simple terms. I will give Senator Tierney a very interesting quote from the Prices Surveillance Authority which is involved in monitoring whether these savings will be passed on to the users. Julian Manser, quite correctly, said that there will be some additional costs short term in award restructuring. He said that there will be some additional costs short term in multi-skilling but that they will produce gains for users in the long term which will be eroded if port authorities engage in opportunistic lifting of their port charges to take up the slack. That is what he said. It is absolutely correct.

        Senator Tierney ran a piece of nonsense in here yesterday where he actually said that the $60m worth of new investment that National Terminals (Australia) Ltd is putting into what will then be the most modern terminal facility in Australia was a cost that eroded the benefits of waterfront reform. He read it out yesterday. What a piece of arrant nonsense. That is precisely what this Government is trying to achieve.

        Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President, what the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) had to say about that. In its report the Authority first of all finds that there was little justification for claims of excessive charges in the stevedoring industry and therefore formal surveillance by the PSA was not warranted. It also recognises that additional costs imposed by the reform process would offset some of the savings in the short term. The Authority says that retraining and multi-skilling will impose additional labour costs but:

I think the interjections in the Hansard will speak for themselves; it is nonsense.

         —Oh, yes, wait for this. Last night Mr Sharp conceded that the in principle agreement did contain a reference to the Industrial Commission. Oh, yes, he has made some progress! In his press release issued last night he said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The IPA included one reference to the Industrial Relations Act . . . which enterprises or unions may refer disputes for arbitration.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not quite sure what the relevance is of having to say it six times. If it is in the agreement it is in the agreement. Mr Sharp, having finally read the agreement, thought this was a matter of some great note. He said it was in there. That was a step forward from the statement of the day before when he said it was not. In his press release he went on to say that the one reference in the agreement to the Industrial Commission was in clause 4 of the agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        If only Mr Sharp had screwed his courage to the sticking place and had just taken one small step further. I refer to clause 5 of the agreement. I know personally, because I spent 10 years there myself, that being in opposition is sometimes hard, but it is not that hard. If Mr Sharp cannot have enough interest in his own shadow portfolio to do even a little bit of work then perhaps at least he should hire a press secretary who can. He made the statement, not me. Two days ago he said there was no reference. Last night he said there was one reference but it was only in clause 4.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 5 of the agreement not only specifically mentions the Industrial Commission but also lays down the full process for resolving disputes under the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, which I can say categorically Conaust followed to the letter. Clause 5.2, subparagraph (d), of the in principle agreement says that if things get sticky any party can go to WIRA and seek assistance. Clause 5.3 says that if that fails they can go to the Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Conaust not only did that but the two chief executives of Conaust, Richard Hein and Richard Setchell, came to see me in Canberra before they went to the Commission. They had a meeting with me in my office. It was in October, from memory. They said, `We want to know if you as the Government are satisfied that we have complied with all of the processes laid down in the Government's program in the in principle agreement. If you think there is any point in having further private negotiations-and we have followed the agreement to the letter-then we will, if you think that is worth while. But if you agree that that process has been effectively exhausted and we should now go to 5.3 in the agreement and seek the assistance of the Commission in getting a conciliated settlement to the six outstanding issues, we will'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said to them, `I agree with you that there is no point in having any more private conferences. You have been to WIRA as required under this agreement. You now have the right to go to the Commission. Not only do I say that you should do that but we will intervene in the Commission and put the Government's position to that hearing', and that is exactly what we did. It is beyond argument that the Commission processes are an absolute integral part of the arrangements laid down for reform of the waterfront.

         —Let me say this in response: if the Opposition wants to bring senators in here at 12.15 in the morning to attack me and to attack this program, they can expect a rebuttal on the last sitting night when we are getting up for three weeks. If I hear nonsense delivered, I am going to correct it. We not only had the nonsense delivered in the Senate but we also had it simultaneously delivered in the House of Representatives. To my total astonishment, a couple of hours ago, Mr Sharp repeated, in his response to the industry statement, the same nonsense about the Conaust agreement.

        I am pleased that he said it because the clear inference is that he acknowledges that this agreement is significant and that it is going to do what Captain Setchell says it will. He says that it will turn the Australian waterfront into an efficient, reliable and competitive industry. The Opposition is terrified of that prospect being realised and even at this last gasp is attempting to white-ant the process and discredit it. It does the Opposition no credit that it continues to do so.

         —I do not want to detain the Senate much longer, and I will not. I simply conclude by saying that the Government has noted the commitments that have been given by the Waterside Workers Federation-and this is in response to Senator Tierney's interjection-inside and outside the Commission by Tas Bull, that both the union and the company will agree to abide by Commissioner Sweeney's recommendations and will put together a working group to draft the agreement. The first all day meeting of that working group was today and tonight I received a report from the company negotiator, not the union, who told me that it had been an extremely successful day's negotiation. Sorry about that, senator.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, I will not believe the agreement exists, as I did not believe the National Terminals agreement exists, until it is through WIRA and has been formally approved and signed by the parties. That is when I will believe it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The parties know that the Government expects both the company and the unions to honour the commitments they have given in the Commission and outside the Commission. I have absolutely no reason to believe that they will not do such a thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to conclude by putting a view from the docks about the waterfront reform program in respect of the non-stop interjections we have heard here tonight and the tenor of them, which totally singled out the unions for the blame, constantly said the company is the shining knight, said that it is always the union's fault and attacked the unions-even the night before they were due to go into the Commission to agree or not agree to this very important agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will tell honourable senators what the blokes down on the docks say to me, and they have said it to me in the last six months. They say, `Why should we have any interest or incentive to cooperate and deliver A-grade reform in this country when we are going to get attacked no matter what we do?'. They are attacked by the Opposition, attacked by the National Farmers Federation and attacked by the Australian Shipping Users Group.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said earlier in the debate, I have a letter from an industry group complaining about the manning reductions we achieved in a grain handling terminal port where the manning reductions were 80 per cent of the work force and where WIRA, the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, had recommended an absolute minimum number required to work the port. The union agreed to reduce it down to that number, a reduction of 80 per cent, and I received a letter saying that it was inadequate, it was not good enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        If that is going to be the benchmark constantly applied-there is a fair bit of feeling on the docks-it will not help the negotiating process. In a perfect world it should not matter, but in the real world it does matter, and the people there say, `Look, why don't we just deliver the basics? Why don't we just give the minimum we have to? Let us give a C-grade result because, as far as we are concerned, in terms of the public abuse we have copped non-stop, there is no difference for us. If we deliver an A-grade result, we get abused; we might as well get a C-grade result and get the same abuse'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have to say, with respect, that that is a view which I think in the current circumstances is valid. Fortunately, that view is not shared by the union leadership, which is taking a longer term view, but I understand the frustration of the people in the workplace who express that view to me. That is what members of the rank and file are saying. But the union leadership is taking an extremely responsible attitude. It believes-and I think it is right-that the judgment of this nation at the end of the day will be whether the actual dollars and cents productivity is being delivered; that will be the real measure, and people will acknowledge or not acknowledge, based on that, whether the union's involvement in this process has been a positive or negative one. That is the benchmark that I apply to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I have no doubt that the Conaust agreement will be delivered. When it is delivered in accordance with the undertakings given in the Commission, it will immediately give rise to the Conaust agreements being delivered in all of the other ports in which they operate around Australia. Halfway through this year we can confidently look forward to a situation where 80 per cent of the entire waterfront work force is in fact actively engaged in implementing the reform program.

         —I rise tonight to address a matter of some serious concern to people right across Australia but particularly in Western Australia. The matter relates to actions of the Custom Credit Corporation in Western Australia and the way in which that group has managed its commercial property mortgages and associated facilities.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Today I do not intend to pursue the specific cases, as there are now many of them, and a number of those cases are before the courts and others will be going before the courts before too long. I do not want to prejudge the legality of the actions of Custom Credit or its clients in these matters. What I seek to do is to raise the matters that do require public attention and resolution.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the outset it is important to note that many of the difficulties being experienced in the commercial world-and most cruelly evident in the commercial property development world-are the result of mismanagement of economic policy by the Hawke-Keating Government. These policies caused a runaway boom and then runaway interest rates to slow that boom. To paraphrase what Senator Button and Mr Keating have said of late: the brakes were left off for a bit too long and now clearly the brakes have been put on a bit too hard.
       </para>
       <para>
        One only needs to glance at figures for building activity, absorption rates of retail or office space in capital cities and commercial prime lending rates over the past five or six years to see what a rough place Australia currently is to do business. Of course, I particularly refer to commercial property development.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have received detailed representations and documents from many constituents in Western Australia who are quite dismayed by their treatment by Custom Credit. They detail a number of matters concerning the handling of loans and facilities during this period of recession and associated asset price depreciation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will briefly visit the history of Custom Credit in Western Australia over the last couple of years. During the 1988-89 period, Custom Credit in Western Australia aggressively expanded its property loan book to in the vicinity of $350m. To place that in some context, Western Australia has a population of only 1.2 million people. By way of comparison, New South Wales has a population of approximately six million people and, in that State, Custom Credit's property loan book is in the vicinity of $180m, nearly half of the Western Australia loan book in a much larger State.
       </para>
       <para>
        This aggressive and seemingly successful Western Australia expansion was strongly supported by the national management of Custom Credit. During 1989 and 1990 a dramatic downturn has occurred in the property market, a downturn which, I suggest to the Senate, is yet to show its full consequences and repercussions across Australia. This downturn is reflected in office vacancy rates in the major capitals-by way of example-which in most major capitals is approaching 20 per cent within the next 12 months. If we put that in terms which people driving past our skylines can understand, it means that virtually one in every five buildings we look at will be empty by the end of this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1990 a very radical change took place in the management of the Western Australian office of Custom Credit, with the Western Australian team being sacked and a new team, comprising eastern States operatives, taking control. During the past nine months or so this team seems to have approached the task of reducing the size of its property loan book-that is, its exposure in Western Australia-with some great gusto, and this is where the problems start to occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        The representations from my constituents inform me that agreements they had made with the former management of Custom Credit have been totally ignored. Specifically, with the financing of property developments, where it is a not uncommon practice to capitalise interest during the construction phase of a project, such arrangements entered into by the previous management have been totally ignored and thrown aside by the new management team. Payment of interest has been demanded of these people, and where this has not been made a foreclosure has ensued. I have also been informed that in a number of cases Custom Credit in Western Australia has approached clients and sought more security-that is, collateral-for its existing facilities. Custom Credit has used the inducement of threatening to withdraw its existing facilities if this extra security is not given. In some cases, this is extra security over people's private homes and other possessions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of these clients had reluctantly agreed to provide this security, only to find a few days later that their facilities had been withdrawn anyway. This action has, of course, forced sales of all the property owned by the people in question. It would seem that the motive is obviously to reduce the size of the company's exposure as rapidly as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        I seek to make no judgment on the legality or otherwise of these actions-that is something properly for the courts to decide. But a recent decision in the Supreme Court of Victoria has found that banks may be forced to honour loan agreements reached by staff members and cannot unilaterally dishonour or change these agreements to suit their needs. In the case I refer to, which was reported in the Australian property pages, I think it was, in January 1991, Justice Ormiston in the Supreme Court of Victoria found against the ANZ Bank in favour of a Melbourne property developer, Logan Swan and Associates Pty Ltd, which claimed that the bank had breached an agreement with the developer because it apparently wanted to review its security position on the loan.
       </para>
       <para>
        In many development situations, as in the case of Logan Swan in Victoria, the developer requires the commitment and support of the lender all the way through the life of the project. In the case of my constituents in Western Australia, when Custom Credit executives do decide to withdraw an interest capitalising facility the developer has absolutely no source of funds. This places extreme pressure on the developer, who already has contracts with builders, architects, subcontractors and all the other associated professionals involved in building any commercial property.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the current property development environment, with the normal construction delays that we are used to in Australia, caused by our dismal industrial relations regime and compounded further by the broader economic environment, developers are totally at the mercy of their lenders. If the pin is pulled on the developer before the project is finished, generally the developer has no source of funds even to fight a legal battle. This is the situation that so many of my constituents find themselves in with Custom Credit in Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This raises the cost of justice questions that have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I think these matters should be investigated by that Committee. Senator O'Chee does not want any more references to the Committee, but I will seek to provide details of these cases to the Committee for its consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other question on which it focuses attention is the prudential supervisory environment that has clearly not adapted to the post-deregulatory era. Custom Credit in its annual report, released in November last year, made provision for doubtful debts of $87.6m across all its divisions-including property, retail and other divisions. In a press release dated 28 February 1991, the National Australia Bank, which owns Custom Credit, announced a virtual doubling of this provision for bad and doubtful debts-that is, an increase of another $87m for Custom Credit. I think we would all agree that that is an unusually large increase in the provision for doubtful debts in a period of only three months.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Bank also announced that it would absorb the management and assets of Custom Credit's Property Division after these provisions are made. I am informed that, in making the original provisions for bad debts, the Western Australian Property Division of Custom Credit submitted a figure of $11.4m. Former Custom Credit executives believe that the provision for the Property Division should have been in the vicinity of $40m or $50m for Western Australia alone. This again raises serious questions about the whole operations of Custom Credit in Western Australia and, of course, the prudential supervisory requirements which I referred to earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fair to say that many clients of banks and financial institutions around Australia will today find themselves in hopeless financial circumstances as a consequence of factors such as the boom mentality of the late 1980s, the crushing interest rates of 1989-90, and now the recession of 1991-the recession we were all promised we would not have but are now told we had to have. In many circumstances mortgagee auctions and business closures are the result and are the only course of action that the bank or the financial institution can take because the cases are so hopeless. But in other cases, where equity or reasonable expectations of commercial returns in future are evident, lenders can and do seek an arrangement to manage the borrowers through these troubled times.
       </para>
       <para>
        The variations between the two options-that is, closing people down and selling them up, or managing them through the troubled times-are varied, and these are clearly a matter for the lending institutions and their clients to come to agreement on. But I put it to the Senate that the actions of these lending institutions properly deserve rigorous public scrutiny. I believe that the matters I have raised in relation to Custom Credit in Western Australia-particularly its Property Division-deserve close scrutiny, and accordingly I will seek to put all the information and documents I have on the cases I have referred to briefly in the Senate this evening before the House of Representatives Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into the Australian banking industry.

         —Honourable senators who read the Sydney Morning Herald may have seen the lead article last Saturday on page one, under the headline, `Middle East Arms Race on Again'. The great search for peace, spearheaded by United States Secretary of State, James Baker, was also an exercise in justifying the resumption of multimillion dollar arms sales to Washington's Middle East allies. It seems to be incredibly stupid after the havoc that has been wrought by weapons systems on both sides of the political divide in the war that has just finished-at least in the direct sense. It could be a shopping list worth $US30 billion, as the Administration has already reportedly submitted to Congress a classified report indicating that it is considering $US18 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and Turkey.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Saudi deal, in two stages, could ultimately be worth $US21 billion and includes F15 aircraft, Patriot missiles, Apache anti-tank helicopters, 400 MI-A1 tanks and 500 Bradley armoured fighting vehicles. These are all familiar household names now that we have been sanitised into the jargon of high tech weapons. At the same time, Israel is claiming that Syria is set to receive more Scud missiles from North Korea. These have a range of 500 kilometres, having been improved by the North Koreans, and can carry warheads nearly three times heavier than those used by Iraq. Israel is reportedly locked in negotiations with the United States to obtain four Patriot missile batteries worth a total of least $US400m. No wonder shares in Raytheon, which make the Patriot missile, have gone up from $US12 to $US75, while shares in General Dynamics have gone up almost 50 per cent in recent weeks.

        War is always profitable for the merchants of death. Yet it was not so long ago, on 6 February, that we heard Senator Robert Ray addressing the National Press Club here in Canberra acknowledging that most of the Iraqi equipment that faced the coalition was supplied by the major powers themselves. He also observed that:

        A major lesson for the future relates to the need to control and reduce the international arms trade.

        Further on, he commented:

       <para>
        Priority will have to be given to controlling the trade in weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.

        Another warning appeared in the Canberra Times on 5 March this year when columnist Tom Connors asked, `Has the West learned a lesson?' Bluntly, he referred to the arms trade as a blot on modern civilisation. He admits that it would be virtually impossible--

        How about the so-called civilised nations of the world doing something, presumably through the United Nations, to stop governments selling arms holus-bolus to everybody. It is time the lesson was learned or are the Western nations happy to have their own troops attacked with the weapons they sold to despots?

        Further afield, in September last year the Washington Post ran an excellent article entitled `Arms in the New World Order' by Haynes Johnson. The writer said that the Gulf conflict was about oil, about a critical juncture in history-according to the Secretary of State-and about arms, though not nearly enough has been heard about that perspective. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is self-evident that oil, lifeblood of the industrial world, and the necessity to forge a new order to preserve peace and guarantee global stability are among the principal stakes facing the United States.

       <para>
        It is not as obvious, but should be, that in the long run, how America deals with curbing the flow of arms in the world's tinderboxes may be even more important.

       <para>
        Last week, Newsweek magazine carried a feature item on lessons we must learn from the Gulf war. I quote:
       </para>
       <para>
        In all the euphoria over America's triumph in the Gulf, one thing shouldn't be forgotten: This war could have been avoided.

        If Western States hadn't armed Iraq to the teeth, if Washington hadn't misjudged Saddam's designs on Kuwait, if Americans weren't so hooked on cheap Middle Eastern oil, the United States might not have had to send over a half-million troops to fight Operation Desert Storm.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article dealt with the arms bazaar as the first mistake not to be repeated. The article went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        To keep Saddam or any other menace from acquiring that kind of war machine again, there must be new limits on arms exports to the Middle East and other Third World hot spots.

        Those are brave words well spoken, but of course it will not be easy. I have already spoken at some length on the weapons sold to Iraq in the 1980s by anyone and everyone and Australia's attempt to come in after the cease-fire in 1988-that is, the cease-fire of the Iran-Iraq war-and to sell aircraft spare parts to the Iraqi air force which dropped chemical weapons--

        Senator Robert Ray said that the parts were only for trainer aircraft, but the fact is that the pilots trained in those planes will be the pilots who fight in the next war in the Gulf. It could be a war which involves Iraq and its neighbours, maybe Israel, oppression of the Kurds in the north or the Shiite Moslems in the south, as we are seeing unfolding right now. But we would share in the responsibility, even though it meant an $850,000 contract for Hawker de Havilland in Australia. I guess that is meant to justify Australia's participation. It does not, in my estimation. Perhaps after Senator Robert Ray's change of heart things might be different as far as Australia is concerned. I certainly hope so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The litmus test will be to see if the Minister does as he has indicated he is considering-that is to withdraw Government support from the AIDEX exhibition which is due to be held in Canberra in November this year-and to see if the export control guidelines will be tightened this week when the Committee finishes its deliberations.
       </para>
       <para>
        These will be two test points for the Minister's sentiments, as expressed in the National Press Club address of 6 February. It would be nice if Australia were to bow out of the arms trade, just as Denmark was the first country to abolish the slave trade back in the late eighteenth century. We should take a lead, along with Czechoslovakia, in banning the international arms trade because we cannot expect the major players to move first. Somebody has to set the standard, and I think that Australia should be one of those countries to do so.

       <para>
        It remains a fact, however, that the United States and the Soviet Union account for almost two-thirds of global arms sales. That is why it is so depressing to see not only Secretary of State Baker justifying a new round of arms sales in the Middle East but also United States Defense Secretary Dick Cheney defending the need to sell US arms to Saudi Arabia, this time to follow up a deal worth $15 billion on top of last year's $9 billion deal.

One of the claims that has been made very clearly from the coalition's point of view is that might is right-it pays to be well armed and, if you have the cash, you get the latest high-tech military equipment. Of course, so do your neighbours.

        I must admit that I share the pessimism of Professor Michael Klare from the University of Massachusetts who was interviewed on the P.M. program on 4 March. He told P.M. that he was pessimistic about the chances for a comprehensive arms control agreement, mainly because the United States had made all kinds of promises to countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, to the effect that they would get arms in exchange for their assistance in the cashbox coalition.

        The US role as the world's most prolific and diversified arms trafficker is so well entrenched that it has come to be taken for granted, as if it were a natural state of affairs not subject to political analysis or public debate. Before the recent US- Soviet rapprochement, US arms sales, particularly those to Third World nations, were routinely justified as essential tools in the global struggle for position and influence against the Soviet Union and its allies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dangers inherent in transferring advanced military technology to a series of dictatorial and frequently unstable regimes in the Third World have generally been overlooked by United States policy makers preoccupied with larger policy goals such as combating the Soviet Union and its allies and keeping the Third World safe for US investment and trade. The popularity of arms transfers is rooted in powerful, strategic, political and economic interests that have so far blocked any meaningful efforts to exert congressional control or to encourage public scrutiny of the real impact of America's arms sales habit. In what is probably the ultimate strategic folly, United States policy makers have frequently armed both sides of a potential conflict in an attempt to create or maintain a balance of power favourable to United States interests.

        —The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) (i) Costs for each centre will vary according to size and function, with annual cost expected to be between about $300 000 and $500 000 per centre per annum. Costs could be expected to increase over the next three years in line with price and wage movements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Community organisations will be funded to establish and operate Family Resource Centres (FRCs) with 6 to 8 staff, in areas of socio-economic disadvantage, to:
      </para>
      <para>
       * ensure more co-ordinated delivery of services for families by working with family-related services provided in the area by all levels of government and non-government agencies;
      </para>
      <para>
       * improve service delivery to individual families by linking them to appropriate services and support, and improving the effectiveness and responsiveness of those services;
      </para>
      <para>
       * provide feedback to services on user rights, access difficulties for families, demographic change and other issues observed in dealing with families;
      </para>
      <para>
       * promote prevention and early intervention strategies;
      </para>
      <para>
       * consult with, and involve, family service users and their advocates in all aspects of service provision;
      </para>
      <para>
       * provide feed-back to Government and the community on the effectiveness of the range of programs provided for families;
      </para>
      <para>
       * promote greater awareness among service providers of the special needs of people from non-English speaking backgrounds, disabled people, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders;
      </para>
      <para>
       * increase the Commonwealth's awareness of regional and local issues; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * be an integral part of the local community, involving and encouraging the participation of families and service providers in the processes outlined above.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each FRC will be expected to define its own particular focus and major functions within the limitations of the available resources utilising knowledge of the local area and its needs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) State and Territory Governments have been invited to provide advice on suitable locations for FRCs. Four locations in South Australia and Queensland were recently approved- Elizabeth/Salisbury/Munno Para (SA), Ipswich (Qld), Logan (Qld) and Cairns (Qld).
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) Family Resource Centres will be accessible to all families with children in the area and to providers of local family related services.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) (b) No estimates have been made of the numbers of families and children expected to benefit from each centre at this stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is expected that the FRCs will bring about lasting improvements in the way that services in the identified areas work together to provide support for families and enhance service delivery outcomes. All existing and potential users of these services stand to benefit through more effective and efficient delivery of services.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) 17 500 new places is the target for 1990-91 (not 12 500). These will be provided in Centre Based Long Day Care (CBLDC), 700 to 800 places; Family Day Care (FDC), 2 500 to 2 800 places; Occasional Care (OCC), 700 to 800 places; and Outside School Hours Care (OSHC), 13 000 to 13 500 places.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The precise location of these places is not known. Places are allocated on the basis of advice from the Children's Services Planning Committees in each State. These Committees identify high need areas and then seek locations and sponsors for services in these areas. New places are allocated to each State in relation to the target population. Over the three years of the 1988 National Child Care Strategy (NCCS) the allocation of total places is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       NSW ... 33.8%
      </para>
      <para>
       VIC ... 27.2%
      </para>
      <para>
       QLD ... 15.0%
      </para>
      <para>
       SA ... 8.4%
      </para>
      <para>
       WA ... 9.8%
      </para>
      <para>
       TAS ... 2.7%
      </para>
      <para>
       NT ... 1.0%
      </para>
      <para>
       ACT ... 2.1%
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The actual number of centres will depend on the size and locations recommended by the Planning Committees. It is expected that about 15 new LDCC will be established, about 25 new FDC schemes, and over 400 new OSHC services. The new occasional care places will, in the main, be added to existing community or neighbourhood centres.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The Commonwealth Government's contribution to these new places in 1990-91 is estimated at:
      </para>
      <para>
       * $4.14 million for capital, equipment and establishment grants; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * $14 million per year for recurrent costs when places are fully operational.
      </para>
      <para>
       State and local Governments will contribute the balance of the capital costs through the provision of land and funding. State Governments will also contribute approximately $l.9 million per year for recurrent costs when the places are fully operational.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) The 17 500 new places will be established in co-operation with the States and Territories under agreed cost sharing and construction arrangements. The allocation of places across States is based on proportional target population distribution. The target population for LDC is defined as children aged 0-4 years with parents in the labour-force and for OSHC as children aged 5-12 years with parents in the labour-force.
      </para>
      <para>
       Planning Committees in each State/Territory provide advice on the geographic areas where there is a need for children's services, together with the most appropriate service types for these high need areas and the relative priorities for such services. High need areas are identified using both statistical analysis of demand and supply and community consultations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Commonwealth and State Ministers jointly approve the high need areas, sites, sponsors and funding for the services.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) NIL.
      </para>
      <para>
       (g) As the demand for child care exceeds the supply it is necessary to allocate available places to families whose children have the highest priority. Priority of access guidelines for LDC and OSHC assist service providers to establish priority as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Children of workforce participants where a sole parent or two parents are employed, seeking employment or studying/training for employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Children or parents with a continuing disability or incapacity.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Children at risk of serious abuse or neglect.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. Parents at home with more than one child below school age, and single parents.
      </para>
      <para>
       Priority of access guidelines do not apply to occasional care services which provide respite or ` `take a break'' care for the children of women at home.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) An increase in employer provision of child care will be supported and encouraged by identifying and publicising the advantages to employers and their staff by:
      </para>
      <para>
       * providing information to employers about the workforce benefits which flow from the provision of child care for their employees, and about child care options available and how to pursue these options; distributing information on taxation concessions available for employer contributions to child care provision; and by providing information on joint venture models for child care service provision;
      </para>
      <para>
       * holding a forum for senior executives of major corporations covering major issues in employer provided child care in Melbourne in April 1991; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * holding seminars for small groups of employers in all capital cities to provide detailed information on the workforce benefits of child care provision, the child care service options available and taxation issues.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The target figure of 2 000 employer provided places is an estimate of the number of places that might be established by July 1992. The estimate is based on the increased level of employer interest expressed by employers (private, public and semi-government).
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The Government announced in the 1990 Budget that income related fee relief assistance would be available to users of employer provided child care from 1 January 1991, and that payments made to service proprietors by employers to secure access to child care places for employees would be exempt from Fringe Benefits Tax from 1 January 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) The administrative and accountability requirements placed on Government funded community-based services will be reviewed in light of the simplified procedures developed for the administration of fee relief assistance to commercial and employer provided centres. It is proposed to extend these simplified procedures to the community-based sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Administrative efficiencies put in place in recent years include:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) the transfer of the assessment of family income for fee relief purposes from service proprietors to Department of Social Security (DSS);
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) the introduction of a streamlined fee relief claiming and payments system for previously unfunded centres from 1 January 1991; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) devolution of responsibility for submitting new child care funding proposals for Ministerial approval from Canberra to State/Territory offices of the Department of Community Services and Health (DCSH).
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) (i) The objective of simplifying departmental requirements on funded services is to reduce the administrative workload on services to the minimum that is necessary for accountability and audit purposes. The reduced workload will assist services to contain costs and maintain affordability for parents.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Further devolution of responsibilities from Canberra to State offices allows recommendations on projects to be developed in closer consultation with Planning Committees, service providers and the community and should reduce the time delays associated with approvals being handled centrally.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) See 4 (c) (i).
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The development of a three year evaluation plan and a fraud control plan are elements of sound management practice. Neither plan is, in itself, a cost-saving exercise.
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (7) (a) The 1989 census of Government-funded child care services indicated that 54% of families in CBLDC services, 37% of families in FDC services and 26% of families in occasional care received some fee relief assistance from the Commonwealth Government. Of these, 41% in centres and 42% in FDC received maximum fee relief.
      </para>
      <para>
       Lower than expected expenditure on fee relief in 1989-90 was the result of significant under-utilisation in FDC due to uncertainty on the part of sponsor groups created by industrial action in Victoria, delays in the commencement of some planned new services, proportionately lower utilisation of services by low to middle income users than projected, and limited State Governments take-up of cost-sharing OSHC fee relief from 1 January 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Slippage in capital expenditure for LDC, occasional care and multifunctional Aboriginal centres amounted to $6.1 million in 1989-90.
      </para>
      <para>
       There was slippage:
      </para>
      <para>
       - in commencing and finalising a number of Multifunctional Aboriginal Children's Services due to protracted consultations with Aboriginal communities prior to finalising the centre designs and delays in constructions;
      </para>
      <para>
       - in commencing and finalising LDC and OCC under the 1986 20 000 place expansion and the 1988 NCCS because of site selection, tendering and building problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Negotiations with State Governments on cost sharing arrangements for the 1988 NCCS commenced in September 1988. Only New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia entered into agreements prior to 1989-90. Other States, except Northern Territory entered during 1989-90; Northern Territory entered the NCCS in October 1990 .
      </para>
      <para>
       The delay in reaching agreement with State Governments meant that about 1430 fewer places were established in 1989-90. These places will be picked up in the later years of the 4 year Strategy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The uncertainty resulting from the industrial action brought by the Municipal Employees Union concerning the employment status of FDC providers in Victoria and Tasmania resulted in a reluctance of sponsors to take up the offer of new FDC places. The industrial uncertainty and delays in finalising the Commonwealth/State agreements resulted in only 445 of the planned 1 000 new places being approved in 1989-90.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) The perceived low income for carers made it difficult for some sponsors to recruit new carers; other sponsors (both existing and potential) were concerned about the possibility of having to meet the additional costs of an Award. Also the lower ceiling for fee relief compared to CBLDC, made FDC a more expensive option to some middle income families requiring longer periods of care.
      </para>
      <para>
       Utilisation of FDC in 1989-90 was 75% of capacity. Changes to the fee relief scheme, which took effect on 1 October 1990, have had a significant impact on the level of utilisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) In the 1989 Budget, the Commonwealth announced a fee relief scheme for OSHC based on agreement by the States to cost share on a 50:50 basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       Families receiving full Family Allowance Supplement (FAS) or DSS pension were to be eligible to receive 61c per hour per child and families receiving partial FAS or DSS pension were eligible to receive 31c per hour per child.
      </para>
      <para>
       South Australia and Tasmania accepted the Commonwealth's offer to cost share OSHC fee relief in late 1989. The scheme operated for a few months during 1989-90.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 1990 election context the Commonwealth announced that from 1 July 1990 it would fully fund the fee relief scheme for OSHC in all States.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) (a) 10 000 CBLDC places

      <para>
       10 000 FDC places

      <para>
       30 000 OSHC places
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Government's commitment to provide an additional 50 000 child care places by 1995-96 was announced in the Prime Minister's March 1990 election speech.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The additional places, subject to agreement being reached with State/Territory Governments on cost sharing arrangements, will be allocated to States as follows with specific locations being identified by the Children's Services Planning Committees in each State:
      </para>
      <para>
       NSW ... 33.7%
      </para>
      <para>

       (e) (i) It was estimated in 1989 that 384 000 places for children 0-4 years would be required to meet total requirements for work related care. The ABS Child Care Arrangements Surveys indicate that some 50% of families with children 0-4 years are `satisfied' with informal arrangements. On this basis the demand for formal places is about 192 000. Approximately 58% of this demand was being met by the current supply of child care places in both the non-profit and commercial sectors, accordingly the unmet work related demand for formal LDC places is estimated at about 80 000 places. On a State by State basis unmet demand is estimated at about:

       (d) The Department of Community Services and Health expended $187 000 on staff and $48 000 on administration of the JET Scheme in 1989-90.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) Departmental statistics record the number of children placed under the JET Scheme, rather than the number of sole parents assisted. The number of placements made is provided in the answer to question 9(b). Most children are placed in CBLDC, FDC or OSHC services. Children may be placed in OCC or vacation care for short periods where circumstances allow.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) (a) For the 928 CBLDC places and the 1947 OCC places established under the 20 000 places strategy, capital grants were made for each CBLDC and OCC established with Commonwealth-only funds at an average rate of approximately $9 500 per child place.
      </para>
      <para>
       For new centres built under the 1988 NCCS, the Commonwealth provided $4 779 (1989-90 prices) per place for CBLDC and $2 655 (1989-90 prices) per place for OCC places provided in neighbourhood centres. State Governments provided the balance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Family day care schemes are provided with equipment grants at the rate of $50 per equivalent full-time place (EFT).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Establishment grants are made to cover the costs of employment of directors of new CBLDC and OCC during the six weeks prior to their opening. The directors use the grant to recruit staff, purchase equipment and undertake other establishment tasks.
      </para>
      <para>
       For CBLDC, the grants amount to six weeks salary under the appropriate wage award.
      </para>
      <para>
       For OCC, the grants are paid at a flat rate, currently $3 320.
      </para>
      <para>
       No establishment grants as such are made to FDC schemes, although each new scheme is guaranteed a minimum operational assistance based on their approved capacity or the equivalent of 50 full time places , whichever is the lower, in each of its first two years of operation in recognition of the costs and time involved in developing new schemes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Operational subsidies are made for each service type on the following basis:
      </para>
      <para>
       * for CBLDC, a subsidy per approved place on an age related basis. This is currently $13.90 per week per child 3 years of age and over, and $20.70 per week per child under 3 years of age;
      </para>
      <para>
       * for FDC schemes, a flat rate subsidy of $15.90 per EFT child in attendance per week and $4.50 per child in attendance per week in excess of EFT numbers;
      </para>
      <para>
       * for OCC, a flat rate subsidy, currently $19.30 per full time approved place per week; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * for OSHC services, a subsidy of $0.52 per hour of operation per approved child care place for the first 30 places and $0.45 per hour of operation for places in excess of 30.

        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 January 1991:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Are Australian requirements for clearance of agricultural chemicals in relation to mutagenicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity equivalent to the requirements specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA); if not, what are the specific differences between the Australian requirements and those of the USEPA.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Is it a fact that the USEPA in 1987 stated that there were data gaps and outstanding toxicological data requirements for fenitrothion in relation to the mutagenicity, teratogenicity and oncogenicity of this pesticide; if so, what were the specific studies the USEPA required to be done.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) When did the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) last review the toxicology of fenitrothion.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Did the NHMRC recognise that there were data gaps and outstanding toxicological data requirements for fenitrothion in relation to the mutagenicity, teratogenicity and oncogenicity of this pesticide; if not, why not and if so, what were the outstanding toxicological data requirements specified by the NHMRC.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Did the NHMRC's review of the literature on fenitrothion miss references referring to the ocular effects of fenitrothion; if not, why did the NHMRC fail to mention these effects.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) If the references referred to in question 5 were missed, what steps will the Minister take to ensure that coverage of toxicological literature is as comprehensive as possible.

        —The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Australian requirements for data for the clearance of agricultural chemicals are listed in the document ``Requirements for Clearance of Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals'' issued by the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council. These requirements include data in relation to mutagenicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity and are comparable to those of other industrialised nations including the United States.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As part of a routine re-registration process, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, in 1987, requested to be supplied with data on the chemical/physical characteristics of technical fenitrothion and on its toxicological, environmental and ecological characteristics. Such data may not have been previously supplied to the Environmental Protection Agency as there are no domestic United States uses for fenitrothion on food or feed commodities and hence full United States registration procedures may not previously have been undertaken for this chemical.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The last toxicological review of fenitrothion by NHMRC was in 1987.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) At that time the NHMRC did have toxicological data available to it in the relevant areas referred to by the EPA. These areas have also been addressed in the course of comprehensive international reviews of the toxicology of fenitrothion (Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organisation Meeting on Pesticide Residues 1969, 1974, 1977, 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1988. International Programme on Chemical Safety draft report April 1990).
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The ocular toxicity of fenitrothion was addressed by a number of studies and the review found no grounds for concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) All available bibliographic databases of relevance to toxicological assessment of chemicals are routinely consulted during the review of any chemical.
