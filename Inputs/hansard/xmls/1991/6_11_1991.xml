        The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesman-like leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:

       Pensions: CPI Relativity

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that pensioners are being burdened with an increase in the cost of living and are receiving no compensation for it. Because the CPI is not specific to the spending patterns of pensioners, a decrease in the cost of living has been shown as 0.1% which therefore cuts out a rise for this September. CPI has shown a negative movement because within its basket of goods, are luxury items that have dramatically decreased in price and therefore cover the increase in basic consumer items that are relevant to the spending patterns of pensioners. Also the wage/tax deals that have occurred between the Federal Government and unions has meant that Australian workers have received an increase in their take home wage but we have seen no counterbalance occur for pensioners.

        Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to negotiate with the Federal Government to introduce a pension CPI measurement that takes into consideration the spending patterns of pensioners. Also that a $4.50 rise be granted to pensioners to compensate them for the wage/tax deals that occurred in January `91.

I do not know whether negotiations took place with the Democrats. The Minister might have the power to negotiate, and honourable senators on the Government side may have given the Minister the authority to negotiate a negation of the adjournment, and that may have been the case on the other side of the Senate, too, although I do not know. But so far as I am concerned, last night was a case in point.

         It was an interesting example last night, because those people who did the negotiations, presumably the Leader of Government Business in the Senate and his opposite number on the other side of the Senate, well knew that the matters that were to be debated in relation to the Estimates Committee E report included matters about which I had indicated reservations. They would have known that in those circumstances I should have been consulted. Indeed, officers involved in that Estimates committee debate did not expect that the adjournment would be negated and therefore were not in their offices. My own officers did not expect that to occur and therefore they were not in their offices. It is unfair that that sort of action should be taken behind our backs and for us to then be told, `Oh well, if we are more than half way through debate on an Estimates committee report we will negative the adjournment to allow us to clean it up'.

We had Veterans' Affairs and Health, Housing and Community Services et cetera remaining. We were nowhere near finishing. Debate had only just started on the report of the Estimates Committee. Yet, the Government and the Opposition representatives had decided to negate the adjournment and, as a result, we were held up here until half past one this morning.

         I am sorry if Senator Harradine was not paid the courtesy of consultation on that occasion. I spoke to him initially when I took this position and indicated to him it was my intention to make sure that he and Senator Vallentine were consulted, as the Australian Democrats and the Opposition were, about arrangements. It was certainly not an intention on my part that he should not be. I understand that he would be annoyed that that took place, notwithstanding my preliminary point. I reiterate that we might not like the arrangements sometimes. I do not like the fact that sometimes the Opposition and the Democrats make arrangements which I would rather not have, but it is still being here while the Parliament is sitting. Dealing with the business is what we get paid for. My concern is that, notwithstanding that there may be some legitimacy in Senator Harradine's concern, if he was not consulted he should at least have been advised.

The situation that we are confronted with is a very childish situation which is getting outlandishly out of proportion. The concern may have some proper foundation. What we have now is a blatant waste of the taxpayers' moneyâ€”it operates this buildingâ€”a blatant waste of the Senate's time so that one individual can make a point that was validly made on several occasions last night and has already been made once today. If it is to continue in, for example, the sorts of circumstances that Senator Brownhill so forcefully put a moment ago I believe the Australian people are entitled to have a very real concern about the priorities that reflects. Those priorities will be drawn to the attention of the voters of Tasmania, if not by anybody else, then by me.

        That the Determination by the Minister for Social Security of directions under subsection 1237(3) of the Social Security Act 1991 dated 8 July 1991, tabled in the Senate on 13 August 1991, be disallowed.

       I will not spend a lot of time on this motion today as I understand that the Opposition will not be supporting us. We did allow more time so that this matter could be looked into thoroughly, and I must say I am very disappointed now that the decision has been made not to support this motion. However, I do want to make sure that all honourable senators understand what it is that they will be voting against.

        These directions issued by the Minister under subsection 1237(3) of the Social Security Act 1971 are, I believe, yet another attempt by this Government to fetter the discretionary powers of courts and tribunals. I want to make the point that the directions under discussion are before us in this disallowable form only because of our initiative, an initiative of the Australian Democrats earlier this year, and an initiative that at that time won the support of the Opposition. This forced the Government at least to provide the opportunity to the Parliament to study this document. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, as passed during the autumn session, contained a clause which removed from the review of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal a determination made by the Minister under what was then section 2511b of the Social Security Act 1947 to give directions to the Secretary about the Secretary's power to waive a debt due to the Commonwealth resulting from an overpayment.

        At the time the Scrutiny of Bills Committee expressed its concern that this removal of the power to review was being put in place and noted that such a decision by the Minister was also not desirable;  that is, section 2511C required the Minister to allow any such decision before Parliament, but there was no provision for either House to disallow the decision. The Australian Democrats and the Opposition were not happy about removing this power from the SSAT. We certainly believe that ministerial determinations should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This was also the course of action preferred by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on debt recovery under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act.

        I presume in recognition of the potential of the ministerial determinations to significantly fetter the authority of both the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Opposition agreed to support the Democrat amendment to make a determination a disallowable instrument under this subsection. I might add that we had to move this amendment twice and both times it was supported.

        On 8 July the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) made a determination of directions under the subsection and issued a notice in which he set out the specific circumstances in which the power of the Secretary can be exercised to waive the right of the Commonwealth to recover a debt owed to it under the Social Security Act 1991. It needs to be clearly understood that, as well as binding the Department, these determinations also lock in the SSAT and the AAT in this particular set of directions.

        We have concerns about both the content and the effect of these directions. Before I discuss what these are, I want to make clear what effect this disallowance motion will have, as there has been some misunderstanding in the past when I have endeavoured to disallow a motion. A successful disallowance motion involves both legislative and political action. If the Senate disallows this instrument, it simply ceases to have effect. However, the idea behind the disallowance motion is that, if the Senate has the numbers to disallow the instrument, the Government has to come up with a motion that is acceptable, something that the Senate will pass. In other words, it is a negotiating tool and one that does have some power.

        If the Government does not want to be left in a vacuum in the area covered by the disallowable instrument, it must redraft the instrument or regulation fairly quickly and re-present it. In relation to this instrument, it could be withdrawn or redraftedâ€”that would be fineâ€”but it also quite simply could be allowed to lapse because its absence in this case would not leave any vacuum at all. This is because, firstly, the present mechanisms that are in place are adequate and, secondly, the Government could, if it chose to do so, issue these directions as departmental guidelines, thereby restricting their application to the officers of the Department.

        I turn to our main problem with the instrument:  it undermines the principle of independent review of administrative decisions. Indeed, it represents, as the Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney has accurately noted, an attempt to bind independent tribunals with administrative directions which carry a political agenda. I believe it is very important for the Opposition to see beyond the subject matter of this particular instrument and to look at that. This instrument is part of a pattern of government legislation that I believe is not desirable and may well be highly dangerous.

        This particular instrument deals with overpayments made under the Social Security Act. Recovery by the Commonwealth of any overpayment has, of course, always involved the exercise of some discretion. This is understandable. There may well be a variety of factors at work that explain why the overpayment was made. No-one would wish to remove from government the right to issue guidelines about the exercising of that direction. The issue here is whether this Parliament should permit the Government to extend its authority in this area to the SSAT and the AAT.

        Over time, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the courts have suggested a number of factors which are relevant in the exercising of that discretion. The intention of the courts is to lay down broad principles around which the discretion can be exercised in a fair manner, taking into account all the individual factors in each specific case. The criteria most often referred to with approval by the AAT and implicitly accepted by the Department are laid down in the 1983 Federal Court case of Hales.

        These seven factors set out in the Hales case are: first, the fact that the applicant has received public moneys to which he or she was not entitled; secondly, the way in which the overpayment arose, whether as a result of innocent mistake or fraud;  thirdly, the financial circumstances of the prospective defendant;  fourthly, the prospect of recovery;  fifthly, whether a compromise is offered;  sixthly, whether recovery should be delayed if there is a prospect that the circumstances of the person who received the overpayment may improve;  and, seventhly, compassionate considerations and the fact that the Act is social welfare legislation and any financial hardship which may result from an action for recovery must be considered.

        Under each of these headings the AAT has developed a number of subfactors enabling the tribunal to apply them to diverse individual circumstances. These principles or criteria have proved their operational worth and soundness and it is generally accepted that they are a fair balance between the rights of the individual on the one hand and the public interest on the other. Indeed, in the course of my discussions about this instrument with various interested parties I could not find anyone who believed that these well established judicial principles did not provide an appropriate balance between the Department of Social Security and its clients.

        As I have said in this place before, there is simply no evidence that the current system of occasionally waiving debts is not working. Of an annual budget of about $20 billion, about 0.4 of one per cent of this figure is debt owed to the Commonwealth. The Department acknowledges that 80 per cent of overpayments are a result of administrative error and do not stem from any deliberate fraud. Furthermore, in 1989-90 about $2.7m in debts to the Department was waived out of a total of $81.4m raised as overpayments. It can scarcely be argued that there are thousands of social security recipients defrauding the Department of Social Security and then having their debt to the Commonwealth waived by some mischievous people sitting on the SSAT, the AAT or, indeed, the Federal Court.

        It is simply untrue to imply that a system is not working and then use that as an excuse to constrain the powers of independent tribunals to make fair decisions. The implicit suggestion behind this instrument is that the tribunals and courts reviewing the decisions of the Department of Social Security are waiving debts inappropriately and improperly. The evidence indicates otherwise. I suggest to honourable senators that it is highly undesirable to allow any government, once a matter has gone to an independent review body, to restrict the ability of that review body to exercise its independent discretion to review the decisions of the bureaucracy.

        We all know that this Government does not like it when people dare to disagree. It is a fact that both the SSAT and the AAT often disagree, certainly with the Department of Social Security. The value of having an administrative review system separate from government is not just that courts and tribunals can disagree with government but that persons aggrieved by governmental decisions have a fully independent avenue for seeking redress. This instrument, in conjunction with earlier legislation, sets up a situation where a Minister can issue directions that will directly bind tribunals and limit their ability to exercise their full and independent discretion in a crucial area.

        Obviously, we are not suggesting that government does not act to recover debts owed to it. There is nothing to stop the Minister putting forward these criteria as departmental guidelines and binding the DSS officers to follow those. But when these criteria are also applied to supposedly independent tribunals it seems to me that we are getting onto very dangerous and shaky ground. The Opposition has recognised these dangers in the past and I believe should be supporting us and sticking to its principles in disallowing this instrument.

        â€”The coalition will not support the disallowance motion moved by Senator Lees on behalf of the Australian Democrats. This disallowance motion relates to a direction which was issued by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) on 9 July 1991 setting out the circumstances in which the DSS and the relevant appellate tribunals, namely, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, can waive debts or overpayments owed to the Commonwealth.

        For the uninitiated, when a DSS debt is waived it ceases to exist. A waiver is a permanent bar to the recovery of the overpayment or the debt. It is markedly different from a write-off, where an administrative decision is made that in the circumstances there is no point in trying to recover the debt. Unlike a waiver, in the case of a write-off the debt still exists and may be pursued at a later date.

        Section 1237 of the new plain English Social Security Act gives the Secretary of the DSS and his or her delegates the power to waive the Commonwealth's right to recover all or part of an overpayment of a debt. Before this direction was issued, the DSS based such waiver decisions on non-statutory administrative criteria which flowed from guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance to delegates making decisions on waiver under the Audit Act 1901.

        However, both the SSAT and the AAT remained free to base waiver decisions on their own body of case law which had developed over a number of years. The 1983 Federal Court case, Hales v. Director-General of the Department of Social Security, sets out seven factors, which Senator Lees has already outlined, that were considered when deciding whether a debt should be waived. These seven factors became the basis for SSAT and AAT waiver related decisions. I doubt whether the comment that Senator Lees made that the Hales case was accepted implicitly by the DSS is correct.

       Senator Lees said that this would affect the independent review of a decision. This is not affecting the independent review of a decision. It is saying that those tribunals can make the decision independently but following the guidelines that are given. There is quite a subtle difference in that and that is the difference we have been looking at. For colleagues and senators here, we have been looking at a very fine line. The coalition has taken an enormous amount of advice and has sought to examine this very carefully. We do not believe that the independence is being fettered but that the tribunals can review the decision, given the guidelines, and review that decision independently.

        In June, the Social Security Act was amended, notably with the support of the Democrats, to ensure that directions such as those being debated here could not be reviewed by either the SSAT or the AAT. The Democrats' reasons for disallowing this direction appear to mirror closely the reasons put forward by the Welfare Rights Unit in a letter to Senator Alston dated 2 October. In this letter, the Welfare Rights Unit expressed four particular concerns in relation to this direction. Firstly, it claimed that the direction would fetter the discretion of tribunals to waive debts. Secondly, it claimed the direction would substantially narrow the circumstances in which debts could be waived. Thirdly, it contended that the direction was based on the false premise that tribunals have gone soft on the recovery of debts and were not interested in deterring fraud. Finally, and of lesser importance, Welfare Rights claimed that the direction did not pay sufficient regard to the special circumstances of assurance of support debts.

        Very strong arguments can be made to refute each of the concerns of the Welfare Rights Unit. The `fettering of tribunals' powers' argument, which I referred to earlier, can be refuted by recognising the true role of the SSAT and the AAT. It must not be forgotten that both of these tribunal agencies are reviewing agencies and not courts of law. The SSAT draws its powers from the Social Security Act and its task is to provide independent review of decisions that have been made under that legislation.

        It is both illogical and inappropriate that such a body should be allowed to develop its own criteria, by way of case law, for reviewing decisions made by the DSS. If the waiving criteria had been specified in the Social Security Act from the beginningâ€”a move which the Welfare Rights Unit itself has supportedâ€”then these tribunals would have had little or no opportunity to diverge from these criteria. The SSAT and the AAT have only been able to develop their own precedents in relation to waiver decisions because the circumstances in which waivers should and should not be granted have not been clearly defined in the Social Security Act.

        This brings me to the second important point in understanding the role of these tribunals. It must also be remembered that just as they are not courts, neither are they an arm of either the Government or the Parliament. It is the role of the Government and the Parliament, and not the responsibility of these tribunals, to decide the circumstances in which debts owed to the Commonwealth should and should not be waived. Of course, the Parliament is confining or fettering the powers of these appellate tribunals by the very fact that it is making a decision on this ministerial direction. I ask the Democrats: is this not the role that the Parliament should play?

        It is very pertinent to return to the Senate debate which occurred when the idea of such a direction was first mooted. Back in late 1988, the Democrats seemed totally and utterly unsure about whether they wanted the circumstances for DSS waivers to be decided on by the Government through the Parliament. At the same time as Senator Powell moved that this direction should be a disallowable instrument, she also moved that the Secretary of the DSS should only regardâ€”this is very importantâ€”such directions. Has anyone ever heard anything so ludicrous?

        When refuting this fettering of powers argument, it should also be pointed out that it is very important that the ground rules upon which the decisions are made should not vary between decision makers.

        In effect, this ministerial direction sets in concrete those circumstances in which the Department and the appellate tribunals can waive debts or overpayments. It provides very clear guidelines as to when a debt owing to DSS can and cannot be waived. To this end, this direction can result only in greater consistency, greater certainty and greater equity between decisions in relation to the waiving of social security debts.

It will mean that anyone seeking a DSS waiver will know the specific circumstances in which it can and cannot be granted.

        Because these circumstances will be set out in black and white, a person will be able to make a reasonably well-informed decision as to the possibility of having a debt waived. The Department and the tribunals will be able to provide waiver applicants with clear and definitive reasons why they make decisions about the waiving of debts. Further, the setting of clear-cut guidelines will mean that it will be far easier for debtors, their advocates and the Department to assess whether there is a realistic chance of winning an appeal against a decision that has gone against them.

        The argument that this direction narrows the circumstances which can be taken into account when deciding whether a debt should be waived can best be refuted by examining its actual content. When considering the fairness of this direction, it must be remembered that the direction conforms with recommendation 13 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of June 1990 entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Debt Recovery under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act.

      <para font-size="-=2">
       Where a client receives an overpayment in the honest belief that it is part of his or her entitlement, and the overpayment occurs solely through administrative error or unreasonable administrative delay, recovery procedures be undertaken only if the department concerned shows that recovery would leave the client in no worse a position than he or she would have been had the correct payments been made.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee's recommendation has been taken up in circumstance (a) of this ministerial direction. Furthermore, legal advice I have obtained points out that the present direction actually refers to the very factors the Federal Court relied upon in finding that recovery of the overpayment should be waived in Hales's case; that is, administrative error, client hardship and the possibility of recovering the overpayment. This legal advice has also concluded that the direction does not make decisions to waive or not unduly depend upon an administrative decision that is not subject to review on the merits by an individual tribunal.

        It also needs to be pointed out that the direction allows the offsetting of family allowance payments, as recommended by the Senate Committee in 1990. I believe that this is a fair concession. It is not appropriate to offset other unclaimed DSS benefits against a DSS debt for the simple reason that it is not possible to know with any degree of certainty that the affected person would have been eligible for the other benefit.

        It should not be forgotten that the direction also contains a special circumstances clause. Quite rightly, these circumstances must be extremely unusual, uncommon or exceptional. For the special circumstances clause to allow a general widening of the scope for the waiving of debts, as the Welfare Rights Unit proposes, would simply defeat the whole purpose of adopting this direction.

        When assessing whether this direction passes the fairness test, it is also worthwhile to look at the effect it has had since it came into effect last July. My office has been advised by an officer of DSS that since this direction came into effect there have been nine relevant SSAT cases reported to its national secretariat. In two instances it was found that the SSAT's discretion was confined, but in both of these cases the debt was written off. In three of the nine cases the SSAT agreed with DSS. In two cases special circumstances were found. In the remaining case, the offset clause was used. These early results indicate to me that the direction is both effective and relevant.

        The third Welfare Rights argument, which claims that the direction is based on the false premise that tribunals have gone soft on the waiving of debts, can best be refuted by referring to Hales's case. In Hales, both the Federal Court and the AAT held that DSS's failure to regard an annual review statement was the substantial or dominating cause of the overpayment, despite the fact that the respondent had failed to follow DSS's instructions and notify a change of circumstances. This set a very dangerous precedent for DSS. It is worth noting that one of the major differences between this direction and Hales is that the former provides that the debt must be `caused solely by administrative error on the part of the Commonwealth', while the latter allows for a combination of administrative error and client failure. The question is not so much whether the tribunals have gone soft, but whether it was open for them to go soft in a way that fundamentally contradicted DSS's own guidelines.

        I assure the Democrats that the coalition has taken this disallowance motion very seriously. However, we are adamant that, when all the arguments have been considered, the only sensible conclusion that can be reached is that this direction should be supported. I wholeheartedly believe that it will provide greater equity, fairness and efficiency in DSS-related waiver decisions. It will result in greater certainty for decision makers, debtors and their advocates. Contrary to the Democrats' claims, it will not result in any great narrowing of the circumstances that can be taken into account by decision makers, nor will it unreasonably fetter the powers of the appellate tribunals. Rather, I believe, this direction will ensure that the waiving of DSS debts is conducted in a more administratively and financially efficient and equitable manner.

        â€”I appreciate that the Australian Democrats and the Opposition have both put a considerable amount of time and effort into determining a view on directions. I should say at the outset that the only purpose for doing this at all is to achieve some consistency in decision making, because that is always the problem. I would have thought that anything the Government can do which makes this process more certain for clients and for the Department of Social Security has to be better for all concerned. That is the only purpose involved in the exercise today.

        The power of departmental staff to waive debts due to the Commonwealth has existed under the Audit Act for a very long time. The exercise of the power to waive is regulated by guidelines under the Audit Act and issued by the Minister for Finance. In general terms, those guidelines require that for a payment to be waived, it must have been made as a result of departmental error and payment must have been received by the debtor in good faith. The exercise of the power to waive a debt under the Audit Act is not open to appeal to appeals tribunals.

        Subsection (1) of section 1237 of the Social Security Act provides for the possible waiver of a social security debt due to the Commonwealth. Subsection (3) of that same section permits the Minister for Social Security to issue directions concerning the waiver of social security debts. Subsection (2) of that same section of the Social Security Act makes such ministerial directions binding on the Secretary and his delegates. Paragraph (m) of section 1250(1) of the Social Security Act also makes such ministerial directions binding on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. By extension, of course, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is also bound because it has to work under the same conditions that apply to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.

        On 8 July I issued the set of directions which are now before the Senate in this debate. These directions are based on the guidelines of the Minister for Finance which apply to Audit Act waiver powers. They are adjusted as required for the specific needs of my portfolio.

        It is not just my view but a pretty firm view within the Government that the directions are justified in the interests of promoting the consistency to which I earlier referred.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Without these directions, as a matter of law different decision makers can decide, and have decided, similar cases entirely inconsistently. In addition, any two social security appeals tribunals in different Statesâ€”and even in the same Stateâ€”can decide two identical cases differently. I would have thought that is not in the interests of clients or the Department and it is not a bad idea for us to do anything we can do to stop it.

        Any one social security appeals tribunal, for its own reasons, can decide that it wants to depart from informal guidelines that are followed by the departmental decision makers. Therein lies a real problem. When a tribunal decides to depart from guidelines that it knows the decision maker was operating under, we have never ending examples of inconsistency. That is why we are here today. We need greater certainty and I think the application of consistent and fair guidelines is the only way we will get it.

        There are a few points to note in considering these directions. Firstly, the criteria that are set down are general in scope. They are not blanket criteria forbidding any waiver decisions. I am not certain that that has been entirely reflected in Senator Lees's views. The criteria echo what is generally applied in the Commonwealth public administration and are based, as I said earlier, on the guidelines of the Minister for Finance which apply to the Audit Act.

        The directions bind the tribunals in the same way as do regulations. There is not much difference between these directions and regulations anyway. They are disallowable by either House; and they have been considered by a Senate standing committee. So, in any event, I would have thought we were talking about a pretty fine line of difference.

        If these directions are adopted, they still leave appeals tribunals with the jurisdiction to consider social security overpayment appeals. It seems to me that the directions still address the basic concern in respect of welfare rights. But there is still that power. Few, if any, other departments raise overpayments which can be reviewed by appeals tribunals; they are a pretty rare breed. So I would have thought it is only fair that if the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are to be in that somewhat rare category, they should have to apply consistent principles in resolving their cases.

        Like Senator Patterson, I have taken careful note of what has occurred since the directions came into effect. I think they tend to bear out the Government's view, and I understand the view of the Opposition that this disallowance motion should be defeated.

        The directions have not, as yet, created any situations that are in the category of unforseen circumstances. On no occasion thus far have I seen the need to alter anything in them. But I accept what Senator Patterson said in terms of the need for continued monitoring. I can undertake to have that not only continued but also reported in the Department's annual report so that every honourable senator can see what has occurred during that time.

        We are four years into a five year formal transition period, which all would acknowledge has not fully realised the ambitions of the DSA when it was enacted in 1987. The last four years have been a valuable learning period for all the stake-holders involved. Both the Department and service providers now need to reflect openly on where we are at, and jointly on what the prospects are for the future.

        Significant numbers of parents and consumers continue to be concerned about the impact of the Disability Services Act on their lives, and do not clearly understand the rationale of government policy on disability services. In this regard the Department will need to pursue a more active and strategic approach to marketing the program and the benefits it offers. Fear and uncertainty are major inhibitors of development and ones which affect service providers and the Department equally critically, although in different ways.

        The Endeavour Foundation is the largest community based charitable organisation of its type in Australia. It started in Queensland in 1951 and it provides services to some 3,000 Queenslanders with an intellectual handicap. It has 20 branches, with facilities and services at more than 180 locations. In addition, there are 36 sub-branches throughout Queensland. It has clinical support services, assessment and diagnosis services, family counselling, recreational programs and client development programs. This is what the Endeavour Foundation said about the disability support program in the Federal Budget:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The recession has already forced organisations into a position where the emerging needs of people with an intellectual handicap are not able to be met and waiting lists for services grow longer every day. People with the highest support needs and people leaving special schools at the end of this year will be especially hard hit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the Federal Budget, all organisations had their Disability Service Programme block grants slashed by 2% without warning. Endeavour's grants have been reduced by $160,000 from the amounts included in the contracts signed only two months ago. To be advised by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services that this reduction was a bureaucratic decision and not to blame the Government is just not acceptable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a further consequence to the Federal Budget, there will be no increase in the Invalid Pension this yearâ€”this will obviously affect every Client of Endeavour Foundation.

        The Department's reply is to market the program. How can the Minister reconcile these two separate statements?

         â€”I understand that the moneys made available for the types of activities undertaken by the Endeavour Foundation have not, overall, been decreased. There has been some marginal change to indexation factors, but in fact the Government has continued to indicate its very real support for the betterment of the conditions of those with disabilities in the Australian community. That does not mean that a perfect outcome has been achieved. It is very important that governments listen to such organisations as the Endeavour Foundation.

         Where critical comments have a base in either the actual delivery of services or in the policy underlying that delivery, I am quite sure that this Government will be open to persuasion that an alteration might be made. There has to be a recognition from both sides of the good faith of each side so that, on the one hand, as I say, there is a proper recognition by government of the sorts of organisations to which Senator Herron refers which deliver services to enable us to be a compassionate and just society as far as persons with disabilities are concerned, and that recognition is expressed in practical support from the Budget. With that goes a recognition that that experience ought to be listened to by government. On the other hand, it is important that these organisations also recognise that the Government, within the constraints of the moneys which taxpayers are prepared to provide, does attempt to ensure that the legitimate needs of those in the community with disabilities are met.

I have since received these figures for over 50 Federal agencies for the period 1989 to 1991. Each agency collects its own figures annually by way of staff questionnaires and then provides its figures to the Public Service Commission, which collates them.

         The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) may recall that I sought and received similar figures at last year's Estimates for the years 1986 to 1989. He may also recall that virtually one year ago today the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and now Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe, expressed his concern in relation to the declining recruitment by the Australian Public Service of people with disabilities. Mr Howe was launching the Public Service Commission's disability information strategy at the National Press Club. The Minister may remember that the Government had allocated $50,000 from last year's Budget for the development of a Public Service wide disability information strategy.

         Obviously disgusted by the news that between 1986 and 1989 the base grade recruitment of people with disabilities by the Australian Public Service had dropped from 5.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent, Minister Howe stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I regard as totally unsatisfactory the reported decline in the level of recruitment of people with disabilities into the public service.

         When I undertook an analysis of these figures of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service, broken down according to agencies, it became patently obvious that the problem to which Minister Howe was referring is occurring virtually throughout the entire Public Service. Of the 50 agencies where comparison could be made between 1986 and 1989, the proportion of total employees with disabilities had fallen in 44 of them. It had risen in only five agencies and remains static in the remaining agency. So in 44 of the 50 agencies it had declined.

         On 28 December last year I issued a media release calling for immediate action to arrest this across the board decline in the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service. Considering the strong rhetoric from the highly influential Minister Howe as well as his commitment to seek further remedies in consultation with Senator Cook, I thought I was not being too optimistic in believing that something might be done to improve this totally unsatisfactory situation.

       <para>
        1989 and 1991 it was possible to undertake a comparison of the employment of people with disabilities in 54 Federal government agencies. Of these 54 agencies, 40 reported a decline in their employment of people with disabilities between 1989 and 1991. Thirteen reported an increase while one agency remained static.

         Very relevant to the issue we are discussing is the fact that on 12 November the Government's disability reform package will be implemented. From that date, disability support pensioners will have action plans drawn up for them in a concerted and welcome attempt to help them achieve mainstream employment. The labour market is depressed enough at the moment. Mr Kerin has made it official that we are in the worst recession in 60 years. People with disabilities and their families certainly do not need the added burden of knowing that the Australian Public Service is employing fewer and fewer people with disabilities every year.

         I am also a patron of the Keystone Activity Therapy Centre at Woodridge in Brisbane, a co-patron of which is the Premier's wife, Mrs Roisin Goss. We know the amount of work the centre does in that area. I have been associated with that centre for many years. I have watched the young people as they have become integrated in what is really a very big business in the Woodridge area. It is very good for the people who are there to be able to work together. They are very interested in their work. Only five or six weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to the centre to look at the different types of work it is doing. It has a printing press and many firms in Brisbane give the centre work to do. That type of work involves people working together within their own capabilitiesâ€”the work force there includes deaf peopleâ€”and they are being paid some wages for their work. When Keystone started the clients had to pay Keystone to get some work done.

         One must realise that the people concerned in the centre have handicapsâ€”they really have got problemsâ€”but the Department's theory now is that they should get out into the work force. That is all very well provided that the standards have improved so that such people are able to get into the work force. I understand from Keystone that of 70 clients, only three have had enough ability to be able to go out and compete in the work force. The proposition seems silly when even people who are fit and well at present in this country cannot get jobs. But the Department is suggesting that people with disabilities can go out and compete in the work force.

         I suppose that the idea is quite all right, but I do not know how it can be done in practice. The Department is trying to put in place a very difficult process. I also think about the position of the carers of these people, as well as the parents at home, who will find the idea difficult to accept. They care for young people who have handicaps and who are unable to manage as well in the work force as people who have all their abilities; although sometimes employers might say that people who have all their abilities are not 100 per cent in the work force, but that is by the way. Certainly the parents and carers of these people must worry considerably about what will happen to these young people.

         I know that the Director of Keystone is doing a fantastic job and that the centre is developing in many different areas. It does woodwork, makes trophies and there are wonderfully capable workers in the organisation, but I believe that they are capable in the area in which they are able to work. To put them out into the broad spectrum of the work force will not help people with disabilities. When they have work to do that is within their capabilities and in which they know their limitations, when they also know the people with whom they work and with whom they have been associated for many years, that is a different matter. But the Department's plan is too ambitious.

         Also in Queensland the Department has told the Keystone Activity Therapy Centre and indeed the Endeavour Therapy Foundation that they have to put people into the work force, but the Department itself is not willing to employ people who have handicaps. This is quite wrong. The executive director wrote a letter, to which I added an endorsement, to the Department saying that if the Department is so willing to make these suggestions it should be willing to take action itself and provide some job opportunities. So far, although the Department in Queensland talks about it, it has not been willing to take any action in this regard. This needs to be brought to the Department's attention. If the Department is asking other employers to take on people with disabilities, I believe that the Department itself should also be willing to give an example to other employers.

The people there take in ironing, and indeed one of my daughters is a customer. They have opportunities to do these things, but to do them within their own area of ability. They are helped and trained by the wonderful people in the Endeavour Foundation and in activity therapy centresâ€”not only the centre in Woodridge but also in various other activity centres in Brisbane and throughout the State.

I have had experience over 32 years with disability services, in that my eldest daughter has an intellectual handicap. I am appalled at what I see occurring with the Disability Services Act. Two weeks ago I was at Help Industries at New Farm, which looks after 160 people with disabilities. It is governed by a board of retired businessmen and is basically self-supporting. To give an example of what the people there are capable of, they have developed a machine which assembles clothes pegs. This machine is the first of its type in the world. They have a patent on it and in fact they have negotiated and sold one of these machines to Japan. This machine was developed by one of the businessmen as a result of him seeing the rows of people with intellectual handicaps putting together clothes pegs and thinking that there must be a better way of doing it. So he designed this machine and it has been put into effect. It was built on the premises and a world patent has been granted.

         The Disability Services Act and the Department that controls it wants to close down Help Industries. It is an absurdity. The clients who go there are developed to the maximum of their ability. They are encouraged to go out into the work force. I asked at the Estimates Committee hearing a year ago whether the director of the program had been to inspect Help Industries at New Farm. The answer was no. I was there two weeks ago and the answer was still no. The boffins in Canberra have not deigned to go and see one of the most effective and useful enterprises in this country. The local people have been to see it, but the mandarins in the citadel have not bothered to go and see it. That is one example. The effect of the Disability Services Act will be to close that down.

         There is another centre in Brisbane called the Mercy Centre. It has attached to it a commercially effective laundry. In fact, it had the laundry contract to look after the linen for the railways in Queensland. It is staffed primarily by intellectually handicapped women, and a large number of them live on the premises. The effect of the Disability Services Act is that it will not allow what is called backfilling. The way that term is used in the nomenclature sounds as though we are filling in a pothole, but that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, namely, that if any of the elderly ladies there, or the young ones for that matter, leave the Mercy Centre the nuns are not allowed to fill that position with someone coming onto the premises. They have to be placed somewhere off the premises, and the Mercy Centre has bought houses in the area so that some of these disabled people can live together in groups of four. Social workers come in and take care of them from nine to five Monday to Friday. One can imagine what occurs out of hours and at weekends with severely intellectually handicapped people. There is not the tender loving care on the part of the volunteers or the nuns to look after them.

Of course we want these people to achieve their objectives and to be absorbed into the community, but it ignores the reality of the severe intellectually handicappedâ€”some like my daughter who cannot speakâ€”of whom people are saying they should be trained and sent into the work force. It is absurd. I would like the mandarins and the boffins in this sheltered environment, this sheltered workshop of Canberra, to go out into the community and see what is being done by these organisations that are looking after the people and caring for them with that four-letter wordâ€”which is not understood by the mandarins and boffins of Canberraâ€”`love'.

It cannot even employ people with severe disabilitiesâ€”or with any disability. The numbers in employment are decreasing, as Senator Patterson has shown with the figures that she produced. That is the hypocrisy of the system and I would like the Minister to respond to this point, which was also raised by Senator Harradine and by Senator Bjelke-Petersen.

         â€”I think there are two aspects to the discussions taking place in the Committee this morning. As to the question of the movement of those people with intellectual disabilities of varying degrees of severity into the more general work force out of what were termed sheltered workshops, drawing on the practical observations and experience not only of Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator Herron but also of others who have spoken in the Estimates committees, as well as our general experience out in the electorate from which we are electedâ€”and most of us do get around to the various facilities in the electorateâ€”I think the attention of the Government has been drawn properly to the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of requiring a transition out of these types of work situations to the more general working community.

         For that reason, it has been made clear that there is no intention on the part of the Government to close down or defund those projects which cannot meet what has been considered to be a proper objective. If that cannot be met, then the organisation concerned will still receive funding for the provision of its services, as long as there is an observation by that organisation of the standards which are expected and which ordinarily are achieved and achieved well above the minimum stipulations set down in the various documents put out by the Department relating to the human rights of the clients of these services.

         I would have to agree with much of what has been put to the Committee about the very grave difficulty of putting this objective as though it were able to be practically implemented in a fairly ready way when quite clearly the experience is that it cannot be. Senator Patterson's major matter of concern, in a very full presentationâ€”and I am glad that she delivered it in a fairly slow and measured way so that I could pick up some of the figures, which is her normal way of addressing the chamberâ€”was to point out quite rightly that there has been a slight overall decrease in the number of staff with disabilities employed within the Australian Public Service. That has to be recognisedâ€”it is a factâ€”and Senator Patterson has put that into a form which highlights that fact. One of the difficulties that has to be recognised in using these figures, and the matter of whether a person in the Australian Public Service is categorised properly as being disabled, is a question for that person. In other words, it is a question of self-identification. It may beâ€”I just say `may be'; I am not saying that this would make a huge difference to the figuresâ€”that there are some people in the Australian Public Service who do not wish to identify themselves as being disabled. I suppose they might be at the end of the spectrum, which would indicate that they have a less severe disability than some others.

         â€”I was only mentioning that as one factor, and I conceded it was a very minor one. The fact is that there will be people within the Australian Public Service who might otherwise be objectively described as disabled but who have not identified themselves as such. It is as simple as that. But the real point is that there has been an decreaseâ€”there is no doubt about that. In part, it can be attributed to an overall reduction in the number of base level staff due to the restructuring of departments and streamlining of functions at lower levels, the reduction in suitable jobs due to technological change and multiskilling, and limited regional APS job opportunities due to concentration of the Commonwealth Public Service primarily in capital cities.

This is being put together by the Department with the Public Service Commission, and I believe that is the vehicle which will be used to try to rectify the sorts of matters which the honourable senator has brought to our attention concerning the employment in the Australian Public Service of people with disabilities.

Apart from that fact, if there had been an increase of 4,000 public servants I imagine that there would have been an increase in the number of disabled, even in the lower strata.

         However, the Minister missed a point I think Senator Herron particularly made, and that was that the Department will not close institutions that are badly needed by the profoundly disabled. I am not quite sure what description the Department puts on that because I and other members of a Senate committee which is presently looking at this matter are finding difficulty with the description of some disabled who are unable to be employed. But the Minister ignored completely that ability, which Senator Herron pointed out the Department has refused to acknowledge, to allow backfilling. So these institutions that care for the profoundly disabled are not allowed to backfillâ€” to put someone in who is presently coming up through the school system or through the system. We have profoundly disabled people arriving at the doorstep every day who have not previously needed care but now do. The Government is not permitting the backfilling of those institutions. Therefore, this is a problem which all the institutions bring to us and which must be addressed by the Government.

         When we say there has been a decrease, each one of those figures is an individual; each one is a person. As I moved around Victoria going to sheltered workshop after sheltered workshop, some expressed their desire to remain in those workshops and a number expressed their desire to go into open employment. If they are to go into open employment, then the Public Service and statutory authorities ought to be setting the example. We ought to be seeing by now first-class enclaves really working and demonstrating and setting an example to the private sector of what can be done. The only evidence I have seen of that was last week when I visited the Portland aluminium smelter. It is in the process of setting up an enclave for 10 people from the school for intellectually handicapped. The company itself, in conjunction with that school, is undertaking some of the work being done at that school at the smelter itself by incorporating those people. There is a whole program being set up to ensure that the staff are prepared and ready to accept those people as they come in.

Now the Government is telling us that that is one of the reasons for the decline in the number of persons with disabilities employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. The Government would have it both ways.

From that date, the Tasmanian Government has imposed a means test on its scheme. That means test will result in employed persons with disabilities virtually being prevented from receiving the amount of allowance that they received under the original transport and parking concession scheme.

We need to ensure that the arbitrary historical pattern of funding or providing some services by different levels of government does not lead to the sorts of demarcation problems and contradictory decisions that Senator Harradine has outlined.

         I preface my remarks by pointing out to the Minister that in this area we should appreciate that there needs to be considerable caution. We need to recognise the enormous financial interest that international drug companies have in ensuring the rapid spread, as it were, the rapid sale, of their products. Quite clearly, they are most interested in obtaining approval for their product. It is absolutely essential in whatever we do in this area, whatever the Department does in this area, always to have that aspect in the forefront of our minds.

         I refer as an example to the drug Depo-Provera in the contraceptive area. The particular manufacturer was very keen to promote this drug. Indeed, when the conference was called in 1981 by the World Health Organisation's HRP program coordinating committee, the manufacturer was amongst those who were making recommendations for the drug's approval.

         If one looks at the toxicology review panel on that occasion, the first name one sees is Professor Michael Briggs. The Committee may recall that it was Professor Briggs who was found to have falsified information relating to the ill effects of the contraceptive pill in research he was doing. That research was being paid for by the American manufacturer of the pill. Frankly, I do not think Deakin University has recovered from that scandal. It should be well and truly in the forefront of our minds that manufacturing companies, certain drug companies, will do almost anything to ensure that their drugs are approved. In the Baume report, the Commonwealth Medical Officers Association comments on page 5:

        Clearly, the Association is aware of this aspect. I turn now to the specific indications of this report. On pages 22 and 23, under the heading `Evaluation', the report states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All of the recent reviews of drug evaluation in Australia have recommended the exchange of evaluation reports with countries of similar standards. The PSB review stated:  given the high level of success the Australian regulatory authorities have had in recent years, the team would be reluctant to see marketing approval granted automatically on the basis of approvals granted in other countries. However, there do appear to be opportunities available to reduce workloads over the longer term through the exchange of evaluations with those countries with a similar industry structure, population and regulatory standards as ours. Sweden and Canada would seem to fit these criteria best.
       </para>
       <para>

        It is significant that the Committee should understand that here is a situation which gives a cautionary note. Overall the report seems to promote the view that there should be an agreement between, for example, Australia and Canada, and presumably Sweden and certain other countries. I ask the Minister: what, in effect, will be the result of such an agreement? Would it mean that the approval of the drugs in those countries would result in automatic approval in Australia and, if not, what further conditions would apply? I also ask the Minister to detail to the Committee whether any representatives from Australia will be attending the drug harmonisation conference which is taking place this month in Europe. If so, what briefings will those officers have? Is the Minister aware that this drug harmonisation conference is very strenuously supported by the international major drug manufacturing industries?

         â€”My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, concerns the Prime Minister's new federalism. Is the Cabinet now opposed to giving to the States new taxing powers? Is the Cabinet now supporting as an alternative giving to the States a guaranteed share of income? What are the theoretical and practical difficulties nevertheless identified by the Prime Minister in this latter alternative? Is the Government not using these difficulties as an excuse for bowing to Mr Keating's opposition to tax sharing? Therefore, are the concerns of Premiers Bannon and Lawrence that the whole thing is a futile exercise not well founded?

         â€”It is not my habit to say in the Senate at Question Time what the Cabinet is considering in relation to particular matters. For example, the question of new taxing powers and the guaranteed share of income are matters which have been put on the table, or are likely to be put on the table, by the States at the Premiers Conference. They are the subject of negotiations, in respect of which draft papers have in some cases already been prepared. But I am not able to comment on what Cabinet's consideration of these matters is.

         In so far as the honourable senator asked me about practical difficulties, difficulties in relation to both issues have been identified very much in public debateâ€”I think correctly. A lot of difficulties would be occasioned by States having taxing powers in terms of macro-economic management by the national government. Difficulties of a practical kind would be associated with the guaranteed share of income.

         â€”It is clear that the efforts that have been made to achieve a negotiated and comprehensive settlement are at a rather critical point at this stage. As Senator Loosely has noted, Serbia did again reject the European peace plan when the peace conference run by the Europeans in The Hague convened last night our time. That plan proposed to transform Yugoslavia into a loose grouping of six republics and had been supportedâ€”or at least not opposedâ€”by the five republics other than Serbia.

         In rejecting the plan as it did last night, Serbia is understood to have proposed instead a plan for border changes within Yugoslavia that would have allowed Serbian minorities in other republics to take their territory with them into a redefined and Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation. The Republic of Montenegro seems now to have supported that Serbian proposal, whereas previously it had not opposed the EC plan. But it was rejected by the other republics, not least for the serious implications it would have had for their current territorial status. So there does seem to be an impasse.

         After the break-up of yesterday's round of talks, at which Serbia and Croatia did agree on yet another cease-fire, Lord Carrington warned participants in the conference that if that cease-fire failed to hold he proposed that next Fridayâ€”that is, in a couple of days timeâ€”the conference be adjourned indefinitely. EC Foreign Ministers indicated a couple of days ago, on 4 November, that economic sanctions against Serbia would be considered on Friday, when Lord Carrington is due to report to them, if there was a continuation of the refusal to endorse the peace plan. I understand that EC Ministers are now looking at the possible suspension or termination of the benefits under various bilateral agreements which presently exist between EC and Yugoslavia and, specifically, the possibility of an oil embargo. Of course, that may well be the most effective form of sanction because, whereas Croatia has some domestic oil production capacity, Serbia is almost wholly dependent on oil imports.

         As to our governmental reaction, we have consistently and repeatedly made known, both in public statements and in direct communications to the Europeans, our support for the EC peace efforts. There is no doubt in the minds of European leaders of Australia's support. While we are obviously not a party principal to the negotiations in The Hague, we do of course support any peace proposal which is agreed to by the parties directly involved. No such plan should be allowed to founder on the basis of rejection by one republicâ€”or two republics if one brings Montenegro into it.

         What the EC is essentially looking for from Australia and other like-minded countries are supportive measures. I indicate again, as I did yesterday, that the Australian Government stands ready to participate in any measures in line with those being considered by the EC or the UN Security Council. The Government's position is also well-known to the parties on the ground. Our Embassy has consistently made our views known directly to the Serbian authorities. But, in case there is any misunderstanding at all in light of the latest developments, I have this morning instructed our Ambassador in Belgrade to make quite clear, yet again, that we firmly believe that a solution to the situation in Yugoslavia must involve compromise by all the parties involvedâ€”in particular right now, the Serbsâ€”and that we are deeply concerned at Serbia's rejection of the EC peace plan and will have no option but to support international sanctions against Yugoslavia if they are put in place. We will also, of course, keep the Europeans up to date with our reaction, as we have done consistently until now.

Mr Lockwood estimates that downwinds, as distinct from cross-winds, which were covered in the Minister's last answer on this subject, will require 23 per cent of traffic on the north-south runways to operate in a northerly direction. Is this estimate double the estimate in the EIS? Does Mr Lockwood's analysis also show that cross-winds will require the east-west runway to be used by 1.9 per cent of trafficâ€”much more than the 1.2 per cent estimate in the EIS? If Mr Lockwood's analysis is correct, would the 2,000 diversions of large aircraft away from Sydney each year as a result of downgrading the east-west runway be acceptable? Finally, do the predicted reductions in numbers of people affected by noise, previously quoted by the Minister from the EIS, depend on the accuracy of the EIS estimates of both usage of the east-west runway and direction of traffic on the north-south runways?

         I reassert the fundamental flaw in Mr Lockwood's analysis. He has set up an entirely theoretical model based on his experience of meteorological matters. In the past, Mr Lockwood has been the director of marine policy for the New South Wales Department of the Environment. I do not dispute that he knows a great deal about wind, but he knows nothing about the operations of an airport. As I said on 16 October, and I reassert that it is important, the EIS is based on actual meteorological observations from the tower at Sydney Airport, not on a theoretical model, as Mr Lockwood's work is.

         Mr Lockwood met with officers on 28 October. It was explained to him that the criteria of five-knot tail winds and 25-knot cross-winds for runway usage are well below the safe operating limits of most modern aircraft. It was also explained that the pilot is ultimately responsible for deciding what operation is safe and that air traffic control does not direct pilots to use runways if the pilots have doubts about the safety of the operation. The pilot is in command. Mr Lockwood's assertion about safety being prejudiced by CAA cross-wind criteria for runway selection is therefore entirely unfounded.

         The ATC also explained to Mr Lockwood how wind velocity is observed at the airport and used to decide which runways will be utilised. He was presented with 10 years of data collected from the control tower that show an actual long term useability of the north-south runway of 84 per cent, which is significantly higher than the theoretical figure of 76.8 per cent asserted by Mr Lockwood. This shows the dangerâ€”and I stress it againâ€”of relying on theoretical assessments that totally ignore the actual operating conditions of the airport.

         For the years 1987 to 1989, 3,392 aircraft per yearâ€”that is, 1.7 per centâ€”utilised the east-west runway when the cross-wind, including gusts, on the north-south runway exceeded 20 knots. However, under the new procedures, aircraft use the east-west runway when the cross-wind, including gusts, exceeds 25 knots. That is because of the additional capacity of modern aircraft. In 1990, this meant that 1,178 aircraftâ€”that is, 0.2 per centâ€”used the east-west runway. These actual figures are substantially lower than the theoretical figures Mr Lockwood asserts are likely.

         The data collected at the airport casts substantial doubt on the value of a very theoretical study done with no appreciation of the practice of airport operations. Far from confirming Mr Lockwood's findings, they show the study to be totally out of touch with reality. It should be noted that the proposal by the FAC eventually to reduce the operational length of the east-west runway will occur only if the airline industry is in agreement, and it will occur beyond 2010 when alternative runway capacity is available at Badgerys Creek on those limited occasions when there may be excessive cross-winds at Kingsford-Smith.

I have personally met with Mr Lockwood. I organised for him to meet with CAA officers who run the control tower at Sydney Airport, which he has done. Both the CAA and the Bureau of Meteorology have extensively re-examined and analysed the data that has been produced by Mr Lockwood, so I see no further need for an additional study.

         â€”Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade seen recent media reports of Indonesian troops raiding the Motael Roman Catholic Church in Dili, East Timor, at 2.30 a.m. on Monday, 28 October this year, shooting two youths dead and arresting between 20 and 40 others, because of local opposition to Indonesian rule of East Timor? What has been the Australian Government's response to a request from Amnesty International for an official investigation into the incident, including the deaths of the two youths and reports of detention? Does the Australian Government intend to raise the matter of human rights in Indonesia and East Timor with the chief of Indonesia's armed forces, General Try Sutrisno, during his current visit to Australia?

         The information we have obtained from these various sources is inconclusive. The official military account is that the deaths occurred in the context of a fight between Timorese groups outside the churchâ€”which may have had something to do with a fight between supporters and opponents of integrationâ€”and that two people died in the incident in question. A number of eyewitness accounts suggest that shots were fired. There certainly was a military presence at some stage of the proceedings, but there do not appear to be any eyewitness accounts suggesting that the deaths occurred directly as a result of the shots being fired.

         The Indonesian authorities have conceded that shots were fired but say that that was in the context of breaking up a brawl or a subsequent reaction to the situation rather than the cause of the deaths in question. We are continuing to make inquiries about this to see whether a more conclusive, final account can be given in which everyone can have confidence. It does seem that the situation is a little more complex than some of the initial reports sourced in Amnesty and elsewhere. There is absolutely no reason to believe at this stage that the deaths were as a result of direct military or official action.

If information sharing from the bases is extended, would Australia have power of veto if, for example, the Soviet Union decided to use its missile capability against one of its own republics in the event of internal conflict?

The Americans have made that perfectly clear. It is premature to embark on a kind of speculative extravaganza about the various contexts in which information might be shared in the future.

         The facilities are joint. There is no question but that Australia very definitely has joint control over the physical access to the institutions as a result of our joint management of them. There is equally no doubt but that the information sharing aspects of the facilities and the use of the facilities are, again, matters in respect of which joint consultations can be reasonably expected to occur. I am not going to speculate in relation to a variety of hypothetical contingencies in the future on this subject. We will just wait and see how things pan out.

         The important point to be made, as Senator Ray did yesterday, is that the facilities in question have an important role not so much in the context of war fighting as in ensuring that that does not happen because of their capacity for surveillance, their capacity for verification and their capacity for advance warning which, of course, constitute a significant deterrent in their own right.

The equal pay unit helps the Commonwealth and did so most recently in preparing our national wage case submission.

         The newsletter referred to in the question is published by the unit. It addresses a couple of important key matters. First, it shows that women's rates of pay have increased at a faster rate than men's in recent years. This is due in part to the minimum rates adjustment process that this Government supported in previous national wage case decisions. It means that women can be evaluated on the basis of skill, competence and responsibility whereas in the past those assets may not have been properly evaluated in the pay setting approach. Unfortunately, it also shows, however, that average weekly earnings for full time females employed in the work force are still only 81 per cent of average weekly earnings for full time males employed in the work force.

Over the next three months there will be three other publications from the pay equity unit. They will be in the form of an information paper on the minimum rates adjustment process so that people know how better to utilise this pay fixing principle. There will be a statement of policy on equal pay and the third publication will contain the submission of the Department of Industrial Relations to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission's inquiry into sex discrimination in overaward payments. I commend this newsletter to the Senate.

How does the Government justify agreeing to such a blatant rorting of the system when so many Australians are suffering under this Government's incompetent economic management?

         Long term investments of this size and nature are based not on short term assessments of the market but on long term strategic assessments of competitive place in the world and long term trends in the price of the product. The assessment procedures currently agreed between the Commonwealth and Tasmania and the length of time taken to construct the mill after a permit to construct it is issued are relevant matters. This mill would not be entering the world paper market for at least four years, even if the assessment process were begun now. So the current state of the world market is not of particular relevance. There is no suggestion that a project of this kind would be supported by exempting the mill from State logging royalties.

Discussion about some details in relation to the legislation is continuing to take place. North Broken Hill raised a number of issues relating to the proposed legislation but there was no question of the Government being asked to relax any environmental assessment requirement. The issue raised by the North Broken Hill company will be considered before the Bill is finalised and introduced into the Parliament for debate.

         â€”I can in fact confirm that recently there was a very constructive meeting held in Melbourne of the Australian police Ministers which enabled Ministers from all jurisdictions to put aside political differences, which seems to be an inheritance of this Commonwealth deriving from the States and Territories having borders which can at times lead to different laws in relation to such an important matter as gun control throughout Australia. I believe Senator Gerry Jones has been a persistent asker of questions on this subject, asking very constructive and creative questions on this matter, and that is why I am able to surmise the type of question the honourable senator was asking. It would relate to the police Ministers conference which made it very clear that we are changing the philosophy of the ownership of guns in this society. That is to say, the possession of guns and firearms in this society is a privilege and not a right. This is a very fundamental philosophical point agreed upon by all Ministers and which has enabled us to establish a common position on licensing of firearms throughout Australia.

         It was also very notable at that meeting that in relation to domestic violence there was agreement that in all instances where police are called to a situation of domestic violenceâ€”which is better described as criminal violence in the homeâ€”firearms would be removed and the licence of the holder of those firearms would be cancelled. This would certainly apply during the currency of any protection order granted in relation to the person who made the complaint and who was perhaps the subject of assault or intimidation during that episode of domestic violence.

That question of continuous rosters for underground mining is a matter for the Western Australian Government. On 4 November the Western Australian Government agreed to grant Western Mining Corporation seven applications for exemptions from the Mines Regulation Act so as to allow continuous operations in the Kambalda mines. Senator Panizza may or may not know that it is a provision of the Western Australian Mines Regulation Act which was the basis of Western Mining's objection and not an award of the Commission and, more specifically, not the activities of the union but a provision of the Act of the Western Australian Parliament.

It is lighter and it has beneficial environmental effects in terms of lower fuel usage, and so on.

         In so far as Australia is concerned, there are outstanding deposits of magnesite ore which constitutes the raw material from which magnesium metals are produced. The CSIRO, in conjunction with some others, has been for some time involved in research into the process for making magnesium metals. The current methods employed overseas have been unavailable to Australia because of the control of the technology by a major company in the United States and a major company in Europe. Therefore, if Australia is to obtain the benefits of adding value to the resources it has, it is very important that the research work of CSIRO, in conjunction with three companies, be carried forward to the pilot plant stage. Because of this situation, the Government has recently made a decision to support CSIRO in the development of an appropriate pilot plant.

         The essential issues are the capacity to develop a value added industry based on a very important raw material, a resource.

         These are the bases of the Government's recently made decision. There are other reasons for it as well. The question appropriately comes from a Queensland senator because the deposit is located near Rockhampton and some of the work has been carried out in Gladstone. The new pilot plant will be built, as I understand it, at Gladstone by a joint venture comprising two Australian companies, CSIRO and a Japanese company. This is a very encouraging prospect for north Queensland and for a major future industrial development in Australia.

Honourable senators may be interested in these figures.

The Federal Government has now stepped back from its willingness to give the States a new capacity to raise taxes, which of course was linked with the promotion by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of new federalism as part of an important structural reform resulting in greater efficiencies for Australia. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) might yawn. I suspect that is the attitude of the Government to this matter. But it is related to the whole issue of the requirement for structural reform in this country and, therefore, the need to produce greater efficiency to enable Australian producers to become more competitive.

        After the July Premiers Conference, Mr Hawke and Mr Kerin had no concern about going public and saying that they would look favourably upon a transfer of new taxation powers to the States. What has happened in the meantime that has changed their minds?  Clearly, what has happened relates to what we referred to in Question Time as the whole paralysis of leadership that faces this Government. What has happened is the intervention by Mr Keating. The Minister scoffs; Senator Gareth Evans yawns. This is the typical attitude of this Government to the need for new efficiencies in this country. In fact, Mr Hawke was prepared toâ€”

Mr Hawke was prepared to advance this as the flagship of his fourth term in officeâ€”this new federalism, the new relationship between the States and the Commonwealth that would break down the structural inefficiencies that have existed for so long. He promoted it, and he promoted it after the July Premiers Conference.

        What changed? The change occurred on 22 October, when Mr Keating, taking the opportunity of the Prime Minister being out of the country, decided to weigh in and attack the Prime Minister's position. Mr Keating did so, describing the Prime Minister's position as a disaster. At the National Press Club he said that it would gut the Commonwealth. The following day Mr Keating took up the favourite commentator's program, that of John Laws, and said:

       That position happened to be the one Mr Keating had taken at previous Premiers Conferences when he was Treasurer. He has clearly been long opposed to the issue of either transferring new taxation powers to the States to overcome this vertical fiscal imbalance or, alternatively, looking at a sharing of taxation powers. While he was Treasurer, it could not occur. When Mr Keating was gone, for a moment or two both the Prime Minister and Mr Kerin had the courage to advance it. Then Mr Keating came out and made it part of the leadership issue. The sequence of events logically followed.

        Only a few days later Mr Keating again lifted the pain and went on to attack a suggestion that the Prime Minister might adopt Premier Kirner's requirement of a statement on jobs. Mr Keating advanced the heat by saying that what Australia needed, in his view, was an immediate one per cent interest rate cut, an incentive plan to generate new production, more help for long term employment, et cetera. Next we find that the Prime Minister starts to back-pedal, as we have found on so many issues during the term of his leadership.

Whilst the Leader of the Government in the Senate got up today and said that he is not prepared to tell the Senate whether the Federal Government now has a position on tax sharing, the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was ringing around State Premiers confirming to them that the Commonwealth has no positionâ€”going one step further; in fact withdrawing the communique group that was supposed to meet to draft the communique for the forthcoming Premiers Conference because the Commonwealth's position is changing.

Prime Minister Hawke was drawn before his own people to explain his ever-changing position on tax sharing. As a result of that, we read in the pressâ€”and it has not been disputedâ€”that Mr Hawke backs away from the undertaking he gave to the Premiers at the July conference.

She recognised that that was what forced Prime Minister Hawke to draw back from his previous position. What did Premier Bannon say?

In other words, being pressed now by the Premiers, he changes his position again and says, `Yes, we will look at a sharing of taxes but I give myself the out by saying to the State Premiers that there are many theoretical and practical difficulties'. So it is not surprising that the Premiers are angry. It is not surprising that the Party is angry.

        The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) was asked three times to condemn the activities of Mr Keating and to support his Prime Minister and each timeâ€”I might say with a happy sneer on his faceâ€”he wimped out.

I suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, that he also had a fourth occasion on which he could have defended the Prime Minister. When Senator Hill rose to speak on the motion before us, Senator Button was in the chamber.

        Senator Hill couched this motion in terms of new federalism because this is the issue which has highlighted the paralysis that exists in the Government. `Vertical fiscal imbalance' is that wonderful phrase which has become synonymous with the imbalance which exists between the Federal and State governments. Remedial treatment is needed to allow a better and more efficient working relationship between the Commonwealth and the State governments. But the Prime Minister's one step forward and two steps backward approach to the agenda for new federalism simply has shown that he succumbs, on a daily basis, to the pressure that is being applied by Mr Keating.

        During today's little episode we saw the Premier of Western Australia attack the Prime Minister for failing to take control of that agenda. We have seen that as a reaction to the pressure that was brought down by Mr Keating and his supporters. The supporters include Senator John Button. What a spectacle we saw here today! Senator Button delivered and anointed Mr Hawke in 1983. He took the leadership away from Bill Hayden and gave it to Bob Hawke in 1983 in a celebrated expedition he made to Brisbane, having nurtured and carried the votes and delivered them in Brisbane. Today, given the opportunity to support the man Senator Button personally anointed, he denied his own leader thrice. He denied him as Peter denied three times when the cock crowed. One could say that Senator Loosley wants to play the role of Pontius Pilate, because it was Senator Loosley who said, when commenting on Mr Burns's comments, `We have now passed on since then'.

        As well as Senator Button's attitudeâ€”that he would not support the Prime Minister whom he personally anointed in 1983â€”the opportunity was given to Senator Richardson to stand up and say something in favour of his Government's leader, the Prime Minister. But he chose not to do so; he chose to accept your ruling, Mr Deputy President, that it was not pertinent to his portfolio and therefore he could duck it. In fact, Mr Deputy President, if you have a good look at the Standing Orders, at page 42 you will see that during Question Time questions may be put to Ministers relating to public affairs. I would have thought that the question of whether or not the Prime Minister is being undermined by his former Treasurer is very much a question of public affairs and one which is directly pertinent to the way in which this country is being governedâ€”or, rather, not being governed.

        I think Senator Evans is about to leave the chamber. But he has been replaced, so currently there are still only three members of the Government who are prepared to even listen to the debates which affect their Prime Minister. Senator Evans referred to intellectual and moral paralysis; indeed, it is a very good description of his own side of the chamber, where we have Government members who denigrate the office of the Prime Minister by refusing to support their own Prime Minister. We have seen today the cancellation of a visit by President Bush, having literally come to the stage where any good results that flowed from the cooperation between the United States and Australia during the Gulf war have been undermined by the selfish action of Mr Keating in undermining the Prime Minister.

        Let us look further at what has happened because of this lack of leadership. There is an endeavour to turn many people in our society into welfare recipients. We have seen the recent announcements with regard to the rural adjustment authority and what is occurring there. That is all about lack of leadership. It is about an ex-Treasurer, trying to become a Prime Minister, who is incapable of being a Prime Minister and who, in fact, was incapable of being a successful Treasurer. He created a lot of misery for our country. But we now find a situation where that very same man who wrought misery on so many people in this country is undermining the Prime Minister. We also see that the Ministers and the people who sit on the other side of this chamber will not stand up and support the Prime Minister.

I do not believe that they have what is required in their bellybuttons to do that.

At least Mr Burns was prepared to do that. No-one on the other side is prepared to stand up and support the current Leader. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) was given three opportunities to support Mr Hawke, but not once did he take up the opportunity. Senator Evans, one of the senior people in the Government, was given the opportunity, but he did not take it up. Of the few others who are sitting aroundâ€”some of them supposedly Hawke supportersâ€”not one of them is prepared to get up and support Mr Hawke. They interject and carry on about other people talking, but they are not game, they are not prepared, to get up and speak.

        I saw Senator Maguire come in, and I am waiting for Senator Cooney to appear. The Government usually trots them out when it has a difficult task for someone, some function that nobody else in the Labor Party is game to carry out. The Government trots out Senator Maguire and Senator Cooney to come in and support it. But not even Senator Maguire is getting to his feet to support his Leader. At least in Queensland Mr Burns is prepared to support his convictions, but one might think that he is not doing it with a tremendous amount of altruism. One may think that possibly it is all part of the grubby little deals going on in Queensland at the moment for preselections that are directly related to the inertia that is affecting this Government because of the challenge between Mr Keating and Mr Hawke.

Mr Johns went the other way and was prepared to support Mr Keating. He was warned then, to such an extent that the matter came before the central executive meeting of the ALP in Canberra. It had to try to protect Mr Johns and let him have the freedom to support the candidate of his choice without being stood on or blackmailed or bullied by the factions that control the Queensland ALP.

Whatever it is, those people in Queensland are prepared to get up and say and do something to support the man they claim to follow. They are much better than this mob of wimps who sit opposite.

        , I point out that the issues affecting women's training and participation in the work force need to be addressed within award restructuring and workplace reorganisation. As the report says, women continue to experience disadvantage in the labour market. They make up some 41.6 per cent of the work force; 39.5 per cent of women workers have part time jobs which are often casual. They are concentrated in a small number of occupations at the bottom of the employment hierarchy. This is reflected in the pattern of women's participation in TAFE. This is a very well put together paper. I believe that it should be recommended reading for members of the Senate. It is a very well presented document.

It means that this Government has reduced fee relief for the very people wanting to use the TAFE courses.

Representatives from the scheme told the Senate Estimates Committee that there was no demand, yet sole parents tell me that they are being turned back from access to child-care under the JET scheme because there is no money.

         The problem is that more support is needed for women undertaking TAFE courses if it is recognised that a high proportion of them, as I said, are sole parents and that about 256,000â€”or 50 per centâ€”of female headed households in this country do not own a car. Therefore, the very women who are most likely to be using the TAFE courses are dependent upon public transport. Is there a mention of the word `transport' in talk of support for women using TAFE?

In the last year the Health Insurance Commission undertook two research studies which I am particularly interested in: one was into community attitudes to Medicare; and the other, pharmacists' attitudes towards the Health Insurance Commission. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to advise me of the reason for commissioning this survey into pharmacists' attitudes towards the Health Insurance Commission; what were the key findings or results of this survey; and what changes or outcomes have resulted from this report?

         â€”I may have given a wrong impression to the chamber. The discussions that took place were with the software company, which was to come back to the Government as to the costs of carrying out the software changes. It is intended that these changes come into place on 1 February next year, and that date is being aimed for. If the software company incorporates these changes in the normal way in which it updates the programs, there is no problem. If there is a problem, we can discuss the question of the cost of updating or changing the programs with the Government. In other words, the cost burden of the change will be borne by the software company rather than by the pharmacists.

         Budget Related Paper No. 9, Health Care in Australia, sets out five priorities for this and next financial year which are causing some concern. The first proposal is the development of practice grants to complement fee for service reimbursement. A ministerial press release dated 10 October 1991â€”and hence after Estimatesâ€”announced that the implementation of this proposal would be brought forward to commence as soon as possible, at a cost of up to $12m. Can the Minister say how many demonstration practice grants the Commonwealth expects to approve and where the Government is expecting they will be established?

         In general, a practice grant would provide some remuneration to those general practices which choose to reduce their reliance on fee for service. It would take the form of regular block payments not linked directly to the number of services provided. It is believed that this would better target health benefits since it would offer appropriate financial incentives for practices to engage in best practice care, provide financing arrangements to encourage better integration of the health system, and involve GPs in a wider range of activities. These could be funded through a trade-off between providing funds for practice grants and providing funds for schedule fee increases for GP services. That is the idea. However, it is at a very basic stage at the moment and is subject to discussions with the professional bodies.

         â€”It is not intended to displace the present Medicare arrangements in a holus bolus way. What is indicated, as I did say in my opening sentence, is that there will be a system of remuneration to those general practices which choose to reduce their reliance on fee for service. There would be regular block payments which would not be directly linked to the number of services provided. There could be a core practice grant which would supplement the fee for service income of the practice. It is thought that would reduce the pressure to perhaps provide an inappropriate form of GP consultation service involving the temptation to rapid throughputs of patients, clients or persons calling on the GP. It could also be that another range of practice grants could be available to provide incentives for desirable activities such as health promotion and prevention, immunisation, provision of allied health services, such as physiotherapy and nursing, or to target areas of special need, for example, rural areas, services for Aboriginals, palliative care, geriatric care and so on.

         â€”What Mr Howe is wanting is for a certain number or a certain percentage of general practices in each State to be given a grant by the Government for bulkbilling a certain percentage of the patients. That grant will be then be greater than if a general practitioner bulkbilled individual patients. This would be done in the hope that the general practitioner, because of his bulkbilling, would not be financially disadvantaged and therefore could put through fewer patients than he would otherwise feel pressured to do for financial reasons. As I understand what the Minister said in relation to  that particular area, a block grant given to that GP to bulkbill or to have a service which is not a fee for service for patients would not financially benefit the GP over and above what it would if he were conducting a bulkbilling for a lesser number of patients.

         â€”The latter part of the middle part of the honourable senator's comments was correct, I believe, in so far as one was talking about a block grant which would reduce the reliance of the practice on fee for service. I do not know that I ever mentioned bulkbilling as being what was sought to be displaced: it could be some other form of billing. However, fee for service was not to be the sole revenue generating mechanism in the GP's practice concerned, and the block grant or some formula like that would cover a payment simply not directly linked to the number of services provided.

         I do not think I said either that the amount of the block grant, if that is the way to put it, would be pitched at a level greater than might otherwise be earned through the fee for service system. It may be exactly the same. The point is to try to get a different model of payment to the general practice to see whether the types of consultations undertaken, without the pressure of the fee for service problem, lead to a better provision of health care for the persons who attend the particular practice.

However, if one is talking about a payment to a practice, one is not simply talking about wages. One is talking about all of the costs associated with the provision of the medical service from a particular premise, including lighting, heating, the physical requirements of waiting rooms and consulting rooms, et cetera. I suppose the grant would not simply be directed to remunerating the individual general practitioner in the sense of being, say, a monthly wage; rather, it would be an amount of money which would help defray the costs of the practice, including remuneration to the medical practitioner.

Naturally, the wage would include electricity and all the associated costs of the practice. It would seem to me that this is very clearly a step to socialising as many doctors as are willing to accept a grant. If a grantâ€”or a wage, under any other name;  we can call it whatever we likeâ€”is made, in the end the Government, not the patient, will be paying the doctor. When we get down to the nitty-gritty of this proposal, we find that the Government's philosophy has always been to socialise as many doctors as possible. I would be very grateful if the Minister could attempt to convince me that this is not a very large step along these lines.

It is not equivalent to a wage in the sense that, if it were, the GP would have to pay personal income tax in respect of the whole grant and then pay for the electricity and everything else out of what was left after the Commissioner of Taxation got his share. As I understand it, it is not meant to operate like that. It is a grant to the practice to cover all of its expenses. Therefore, it does not really bear a relationship to the idea of a wage.

Then he says that in the UK the ratio is 1 : 1,800. Good heavens! The United Kingdom is a very small, densely populated country; Australia is the opposite. How could we even contemplate comparing those two ratios? The Minister then picks a little town in New South Wales and says that someone there has come up with the ratio of 1 : 1,600.

I am not in a position to say exactly how New South Wales planning authorities, in the provision of health services, arrived at that figure. I suppose it would be possible to ask the New South Wales authorities how they arrived at the figure. I am saying that it is not an unreasonable, plucked-out-of-the air figure, which is what Senator Walters asked me to agree to, in the absence of finding some comparable countries or jurisdictions where a ratio such as this was used. I have found those examples and given them to Senator Walters. I have further indicated, nevertheless, that these are not set in absolute terms. They will be precisely the subject of discussions with the AMA and the royal college. As I understand it, both organisations have agreed that there is an oversupply. The exact quantification of the oversupply is something that needs to be further worked on.

I believe that in a modern, technologically advanced practice a patient could enter certain information into a computer and get some very good information back which would be of an educative kind. For example, perhaps one could feed in dietary habits or something like that and get back an indication of one's nutritional deficiencies and needs and the effect on the heart or the blood pressure, or something like that. These are the sorts of things that could be done by tapping into the insatiable appetite to use computers, which we all see when we watch children, rather than what we were brought up onâ€”the booklets and pamphletsâ€”in order to get information about measures one might take to improve one's own health.

         This afternoon, Senator Tate has talked about governments providing access, and I understand that. The bureaucracy is concerned about delivery. But patients and health care providers are concerned about quality, and that seems to have escaped both government and bureaucracy. There is a fundamental malaise in health care delivery in this nation, whether we like to believe it or not. It does not involve just health care financing: it also involves the quality of the service that is delivered. We have seen the recent changes by the Government in fooling around with decreasing rebatesâ€”$2.50 and $3.50. Just imagine the effect that reducing the rebates will have on quality.

         I saw in an as yet unpublished paper by two authors of eminence something which encompassed the beliefs I have in relation to general practice in this country. We should bear in mind that general practice is the cornerstone of health care delivery in this nation. Unlike other nationsâ€” for example, the United Statesâ€”we have a far greater number of general practitioners in proportion to specialists than does the United States; so there is no comparison. I quote from this document:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Life for Australian general practitioners is becoming a succession of professional and clinical contests. Still reeling from the destabilising debates over vocational registration, they now face turbulence over the question of restructuring. Professionally, many doctors feel impotent in a system that does not value their skills, progressively decreases rebates, excludes them from hospitals and leaves them exposed to the competitive pressures exerted by a growing surplus of community-based health professionals. The danger in the current situation is that general practitioners will become so immersed in adversarial conflict that the possibility of real and useful reform of the system will escape from their grasp.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clinically, many general practitioners feel that the current system is inhibiting the practice of good medicine. Rising community expectations for `quick cures' and the advent of entrepreneurial 24-hour, bulk-billing clinics have ensured that traditional general practice is struggling for its share of the primary medical market. Many general practices are marginally viable at present, and it now seems distinctly possible that the effects of the latest Budget changes will result in the professional demise of significant numbers of general practitioners at the same time as it increases costs to patients.
       </para>
       <para>
        This leads me to the questions I want to ask, which cover some of the material Senator Walters asked about in relation to practice budgets. It is obvious that there is a designâ€”and it is mentioned in Budget Paper No. 9â€”and an ongoing process. It is not good enough to say, `We are waiting for discussion with the professionals or the royal colleges'. It is not good enough, if this Government believes that it is planning for the future. One does not plan, produce something, deck it out, and then say, `We are waiting for discussions'. What if the professional bodiesâ€”the AMA and the College of General Practitionersâ€”say to the Government, `Get lost; we are not going to discuss it with you'?  Does the Government have a fall-back position?  Will it impose it on them?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This appears to be a government that knows what it is doingâ€”although I doubt that. One only had to see what occurred in relation to the reduction of rebates. That was an absolute debacle, which is continuing and is fuelling the debate about who should be leader, because of the division within the Labor Party itself. My first question is: how much money does the Department envisage will be available, on a year by year basis, over the next five years for capital grants to general practitioners?

         . The Medicare abortion statistics indicate an horrific situation where funding of abortion is on the increase, with Medicare directly funding over 70,000 abortions a year in Australia at a cost of approximately $8m for the procedure itself. I ask the Minister for an indication of the extra amounts of money in associated costs. For example, is it a fact that when many abortions take place the aborted foetuses are subjected to pathology tests, and that that is an extra cost which is recouped by the abortion industry?

The matter is being pursued in the way which we believe will in the end provide for what we want; that is, services to veterans being provided in a fully available way instead of the fragmented way which is the case at the moment.

         â€”I thank the Minister, but of course he could not expect that I would find it satisfactory. Firstly, for the Department itself and for all those officers who have served the cause of veterans for so long and so well, it is reflecting extremely badly on that Department and the tradition of those officers. For that I am extremely sad. A few people are tearing down the good relationship that has existed for many years between veterans and that Department; that is the first thing. Secondly, these employees of the Commonwealth who are in a very privileged position right now, with security of employment and security of tenure, when their countrymen are out of work, walking the streets looking for jobs, are being allowed to get away with not doing the job for which they are being fully paid. I do not accept that the Government is treating this matter with the urgency it deserves.

         My final point is that these officers in their dispute with the Government are taking it out on the people who have fought for this country and the people who provide those veterans with the services to which they are entitled by way of compensation. How long can some of these domiciliary nurses and other health providers continue to provide a service for which they are not paid? Some of those domiciliary nurses are providing the only income to their households, are the sole parents or sole breadwinners in a family where the other spouse is out of work. Now, it seems to be that in Canberra, in protected Canberra, we can have this matter wander along in a very gentle way. I do not regard it as a gentle matter. For those reasons I regard it as extremely serious. I do not see the sense of urgency that I would have thought the Department and the Repatriation Commission would have felt on such an important matter. I am very disgusted.

         Having said that, I would like to turn to some other matters. Referring to program 1, I would like to raise some questions about the defence service home loans. In response to questions which were taken on notice by the Department, it was explicitly stated that the 8 January amendment to subsection 4(1) of the Defence Service Homes Act was intended only to preserve the entitlement of one partner for later use. Given that the 8 January amendment has not had the effect intended, will the Department be seeking to further amend the legislation, and what section should have been amended to achieve the desired result?

I was also going to be a bit rude about the Minister because he took from 15 August, when I wrote to him about the concurrent loan issue, to 28 October to reply to the letterâ€”2 1/2 months laterâ€”on a matter which was of some urgency to the people involved. It struck me that there did not seem to be a very great sense of urgency or concern about it. However, when I did get the letter from the Minister dated 28 October, the Minister told me that he was concerned about the situation of people who might have been disadvantaged and, with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), he was reviewing the options with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution. I am just wondering whether the Senator Tate has some information available as to a satisfactory solution.

In the correspondence between the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence Science and Personnel that has been given to me by the Department, Mr Humphreys and his Department come out of this as being pretty caring of people caught up in this situation. I cannot say the same for Mr Bilney, whose correspondence is clearly much more concerned about the National Australia Bank's or Westpac's interests than about compensating or putting right people who have been caught up through no fault of their own by an incorrect interpretation of the law. I was extremely disappointed in the letter that Mr Bilney sent to Mr Humphreys which was signed on 9 August. It was extremely disappointing from a man whose job it is to look after the defence personnel. Clearly, their interests were very low down the totem pole.

It was suggested that the review would be concluded in time for the Budget. Does the Department of Veterans' Affairs acknowledge anomalies which are faced by war widows, and is this view shared by the Department of Social Security?

As I have said already, I find it very hard to support any legislation when the details are not signed and sealed. Clearly, that is the case with the Tasmanian agreement. That is the only agreement at this stage which is in the offing. I was interested that the Minister, in a three-page press release, found it difficult, well nigh impossible, to say that this legislation was being introduced at the wish of the veterans. The Minister draws a bit of a long bow in the second last paragraph on the third page of the press release. It states:

        There is no enthusiasm, there is no support, and the Minister knows it. He cannot say that this legislation is being introduced with the support of the veterans.

It was indicated at the Committee hearing that the Department has had broad estimates prepared on the cost of implementation of the so-called private patients scheme. Can I have these estimates?

Also, the acting chief executive for the hospital, Mr Norm Davie, was reported as saying that MRSA was not considered dangerous and should not be confused with the more commonly known golden staph. The medical advice I have had, which was firstly about the nasal swab, is that this can kill, which is fairly dangerous to anybody, I would have thought, and particularly to elderly people such as we have in the repatriation hospital. That is why I am particularly concerned that proper procedures were not followed. I am not suggesting that the repatriation hospital was responsible for the nasal swab, but I want to know which hospital transferred a patient into a repatriation hospital without following the proper procedures in a situation which is a matter of life and death.

The ward was closed and isolated to ensure the health and safety of patients, which obviously meant that this matter was being taken pretty seriously. The executive said that the ward would reopen in about 10 days. I am also told that, once that particular bacterium is found in a hospital, it is extremely difficult to eradicate. It can be present in a hospital for years. So we are not just playing around. I am concerned to think that the repatriation hospital is being used as an overflow hospital. Are we already seeing the first stage of what integration into the State hospital system will mean for veteran health care in Hobart? I am sure the Minister can understand why I am so concerned. I hope he shares my concern. We need to get this information and we need it urgently. When does the Minister think he will be able to get it to me?

I ask why an officer of the War Memorial is inspecting the Russian aircraft and why the Memorial is considering acquisition of a MiG 15.

         I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the gross sales for this bookshop are just over $700,000 and the gross profit is about half thatâ€”$365,000. The bottom line is that the operating net profit is not quite $30,000. In other words, it is not quite 5 per cent of the gross sales. There is something very wrong here. People would not be in business if they had to use their own money. I draw the Committee's attention to this.

         â€”The general statement I would like to make, consistent with all the positions taken with regard to Estimates Committee F, concerns our receipt of the various program performance statements and associated material. In one instance we received 600 pages of documentation some 12 hours prior to the matter coming before us. This was drawn to the attention of the Senate in the report submitted after the hearings. We had the same problem last year and we had it again with Additional Estimates. If the initial Estimates process that occurs before the Committee of the Whole deals with these matters is to cover as much ground as it should, it is important that the time given to Committee members to examine the material before them is sufficient. Quite frankly, in some cases the time allowed was quite farcical.

We have found that the answers, particularly on Transport and Communications, have hit us on the deadline. Once again, that does not give us sufficient time to examine those answers and prepare the appropriate responses. This has not applied in the portfolio of Industrial Relations, but it certainly has applied with regard to Transport and Communications and Primary Industries and Energy. A greater effort needs to be made in answering some of the questions that are put on notice.

They are assessed by this representative body and grants are given according to the type of project, the priority Worksafe has for it and the capacity of the organisation to deliver a result that is useful and meaningful. That is the basis of the allocation of those funds.

I am not advised of any example of that. I will seek confirmation in a minute from the officers in attendance as to whether they have any knowledge of under expenditure on a particular allocation. As Senator Crane knows, and I am sure recognises, all of this is subject to audit attention by the Auditor-General. Worksafe itself has a huge responsibility, a massive list of priorities and great demand for activity on its behalf. It never has anything like the funds that are necessary to meet all of the demands placed on it at any one time. Therefore, it is a sparing organisation in terms of funds allocated and accountability. I will now seek confirmation of that.

         â€”Every so often the misallocation of public resources becomes so glaring and unjust that it is necessary to raise the issue in this chamber. Tonight I wish to draw the attention of the Senate, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to a very real problem that exists in the far north of Western Australia. Broome may have developed a growing national reputation as a tourist destination but the Kimberley region has more than its share of social dislocation.

         One agency that is fighting valiantly to provide crisis accommodation and family support is Catherine House. Anyone who visits there, as I did not so many months ago, cannot fail to be impressed with the dedication of its staff and with the enormity of the problems that they face. For 16 years Catherine House has been providing crisis accommodation to children whose families have broken down. While it does not cater exclusively for Aboriginal families, it is true to say that more than 90 per cent of its clients are Aboriginal, as are half of its board members.

         What I am talking about may not be an Aboriginal program per se. However, it is a clear commonsense issue involving Aboriginal welfare. This is not only a matter of accommodating children until their family situation has stabilised. Over the past year parents have been referred to alcohol rehabilitation and other specialised services, or have benefited from individual programs of the family support service. I should mention here the work that has been done by Christina Seenikatty, the coordinator at Catherine House, in the fight against the causes of family breakdown among Aboriginal people.

         It must be stressed that in the entire Kimberley region there is no other such support service, and Catherine House must also cater for Derby and Fitzroy Crossing. In the first six months of this year 70 children who were the victims of neglect, abuse and domestic violence were accommodated in Catherine House. Some of the children placed in Catherine House are seriously disturbed and violent, which increases pressure on the staff. Turnover of cottage parents is very high, not because of any lack of dedicationâ€”far from itâ€”but purely and simply because of burn-out.

         I would like to pay a special tribute to the work of Christina Seenikatty, who has kept the refuge operating while having to devote more and more of her time to the writing of submissions for funding. I was sad to hear today that Christina has now had to leave because of a lack of funding. She has done a wonderful job, as have so many of the house parents and cottage parents. Their work has been very much an integral part of what has been going on at Catherine House.

         This essential service is threatened by lack of funds. To provide an acceptable minimum service Catherine House needs $171,000 annually, only part of which is met by the Western Australia Department of Community Services. With the burden of WA Inc., there is not much chance of increased support by the State Government. I hope that the Federal Government will see reason on this particular issue.

         What is needed is a further $91,000 annually to enable Catherine House to survive and continue its essential community work, with some respite for a staff that presently functions at 2.3 full time units. Only this week the axe has fallen, with the coordinator's position and the family support services being discontinued. Catherine House will remain open for crisis accommodation but nothing can now be done to tackle the problems that make its continued operation necessary. Aboriginal families are the very big losers.

         There comes a time, however, when all these reasoned excuses have to take second place to meeting the most urgent needs of Aboriginal Australians. We have to remember that Commonwealth spending on Aboriginals exceeds $1 billion, with $640m allocated to ATSIC for 1991-92. When Catherine House cannot afford even to replace a vacuum cleaner or repair a television set, as I learned this week, I just wonder where some of these funds have gone.

         It is particularly ironic that on 25 October Australia Council Aboriginal arts grants totalling $2.2m were released. Of these, 28 grants totalling $524,000 were provided in Western Australia, and those awarded in Broome itself for writers, arts administration, music and oral history total just under $180,000. The grants in Broome alone are double the amount that Catherine House is asking, remembering that it needs only a further $91,000 annually to enable it to survive. But here we are talking about a sum of $180,000 in the Broome area alone in respect of arts. When other grants in the Kimberley are included, we are looking at close to $290,000 in Australia Council largess. As I have said, Catherine House services the whole of the Kimberley. When one pits $91,000 that is required for this essential service against $290,000 given out in arts grants it is all a little strange.

         We do not need to be told that this money comes out of a separate department altogether but we have to remember that it all comes from the same source, namely from Australian taxpayers. The taxpayers of Western Australia whom I represent do not necessarily criticise arts grants to Aboriginal Australians or anyone else. Indeed, there are Aboriginal people with real and magnificent artistic talent in Broome, and I am not suggesting that the recipients of the $180,000 were undeserving in any way. I know that they are deserving, but I think the Aboriginal communities must also decide among themselves what is more deserving. Is it a question of trying to keep Catherine House going, or is it more important to promote their arts and culture?

         Nonetheless, people have the right to ask why this Government, why our society, finds money for writers' grants when the most essential of services for the most disadvantaged members of the Kimberley community have to be so tragically curtailed. I really wonder why a society that gives Mr Michael Mansell $15,000 to write a book on social and political relationships plays pass the parcel on the matter of funding a refuge for Aboriginal children and providing support for their families. It is very illogical. This grant to Colonel Gaddafi's mate and admirer makes about as much sense as awarding public money to a Liberal Party activist to write a criticism of the policies of the Hawke Labor Governmentâ€”although there would probably be more merit in that than there would be in giving $15,000 to Michael Mansell.

         â€”That is exactly right. It is a bit like banning the veterans' payments, as Senator Newman says. That is a very important comparison, because we have these two areas of the community that are fighting for survival, that are fighting for money, yet we seem to have money allocated everywhere else. As I say, the grants include $8,000 for the Public Sector Union. Considering the $30m granted under various headings to unions by this Labor Government up to June last year, where is the justice?  In public life we all hear complaints that we live in an imperfect world with demands that we should solve problems overnight through `Where there's a will there's a way', as the old saying goes. Very often, as we all know, that is too simplistic. But is it simplistic and unreasonable for us to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to start pulling levers, to start looking into hollow logs, to defer non-essential spending, and to talk to the Western Australian Government just to make sure that Aboriginal children and families in the Kimberley community do not lose this essential support?

         Until we can get our priorities right and fund those dedicated institutions and their staffâ€”which must cope with the consequences of family breakdown, alcoholism and a whole range of other problemsâ€”we have no right to call ourselves a compassionate society; we would have to say that we are a very wasteful and stupid one. I hope that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, as a Western Australian, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table at the moment and who is a Western Australian but now not living in Western Australia, will take some interest in Catherine House and make sure that it does continue and that these Aboriginal children and their families are not just dumped in a ditch and left to die. Very many good people have put in an enormous amount of time to provide an excellent facility in a very remote region of Australia. I certainly hope that the money can be foundâ€”a mere $91,000â€”to keep Catherine House going.

         â€”I support what my fellow Western Australian senator has said about the funding for Catherine House. I think it is important that it does get the support that it needs to continue operating. The subject that I want to address tonight concerns something that has been bothering me over the past few days, and that is the question of the role of the so-called joint US-Australian facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar. There has been a lot of confusion over the role of these bases in the past few days following the publication of Professor Des Ball's article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter

         . I think it is important to put on record some of the contradictory and probably deliberately confusing information concerning these facilities, particularly that emanating from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and from the Department of Defenceâ€”or is it a case of the relevant Ministers not knowing what is going on?  In either case, it is pretty appalling.

         When I asked the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) about the role of the facilities following the recent changes announced by the United States and the Soviet Union with regard to the deployment of nuclear forces, I was told once again that it is not the Government's policy to comment on the role of the joint facilities or to speculate publicly about their future roles. We now learn from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, through his speech to the National Press Club on 4 November, that the United States had informed Australia that sharing early warning data with the Soviets was under consideration when the US President, Mr Bush, announced his nuclear arms cuts at the end of September. He quite clearly said that on 4 November.

         In other words, the Government knew perfectly well that changes were under way, yet all Senator Ray could say to me on 8 October was that I should refer to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the House of Representatives in 1988, a statement which is totally irrelevant in the enormously rapidly changing international climate. It is tragic that, even though the Cold War and the era of East-West confrontation is over, the Australian Government chooses to perpetuate the obsessive secrecy characteristic of the past era and refuses to allow any community discussion about the future of these bases.

         Yesterday, we learned what the peace movement had alleged all along was the role of Nurrungar during the Gulf war, although at the time the Government again refused to confirm or deny the allegations. We have been saying for years and years that Nurrungar has a war fighting role as well as a verification and arms monitoring role. In fact, the arms control agreements that Pine Gap and Nurrungar are meant to monitor were not even in place when the bases were established. This has been our claim over many years and we have now been proved to be absolutely right.

         For 20 years, both coalition and Labor governments have refused to acknowledge the roles of the bases. But, finally, it was spelt out yesterday in the Senate by the Minister for Defence. That was highly overdue. Of course, it was still a denial not only that the role of the bases was important in the early warning of Scud missiles emanating from Iraq during the Gulf war but also that all the information was important for the so-called strategic bombing by the coalition forces of the Iraqis. It was very clearly a war fighting role. Anyone familiar with the strategic role of such facilities knows perfectly well what they are about. Many books and articles have referred to these roles, but the Australian Government has continued its pattern of obsessive secrecy by refusing to comment on the role of what are in effect US bases on Australian soil.

         We had hopes that, with the changing global situation, this Government would take up the opportunities presented by re-examining Australia's commitment to a military alliance drawn up and signed at the height of the Cold War and to the role of these bases that were set up just over 20 years ago to serve US global strategic requirements. But, no, all we get from Senator Ray is a comment that ANZUS had proved its durability and relevance over a period of 40 years and that he was confident that it would prove to be just as durable into the foreseeable future. Alliances come and go, and when they are no longer relevant they sink into the dustbin of history, like the South East Asia Treaty Organisation and the Baghdad Pact, and it is about time that the ANZUS alliance sank into that dustbin of history as well.

         The obfuscation continues with the role of Nurrungar since the changes announced by the United States and the Soviet Union. According to an ALP report on 4 November, a senior Australian defence official had said on the previous night that the Australian Government was well aware that Soviet military personnel `might' inspect the Nurrungar facility, and the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sun-Herald

It can hardly be a continuation when the previous pattern has been obsessive secrecy. But, of course, Mr Bilney knew something then, which of course Senator Ray did reveal to the Senate yesterday.

         However, on 5 November Senator Ray told Senator Spindler that there had been no approach from the United States to explore the possibility of expanding the current so-called joint facilities, or expanding new ones. The Minister then told Senator Faulkner that Professor Des Ball was jumping to conclusions in suggesting Soviet access to Nurrungar data and especially in relation to Soviet visits to Nurrungar. He went on to say that US officials have assured us that no discussions have been held with the USSR about sharing data from Nurrungar or about Soviet visits to Nurrungar, adding that none are currently contemplated. Now, when I attempted to ask more about what was going on in Question Time today, in light of these conflicting reports, I was once again fobbed off with a non-answer. The Minister confused is not a pretty sight. The Minister waffling is bad enough. The Minister not knowing what is going on is a disgrace.

         What sort of government to government communication did Senator Evans allude to, both at the Press Club the other day and here in the Parliament today? It is very clear, he says, that there was a government to government communication. Was it a cable, a telex, a phone call, a letter or some other form that we know not of? Was it another Bush-Hawke phone call towards the end of September?  President Bush is renowned for getting on the telephone and buzzing international leaders to inform them of his latest international strategic plans. Did he buzz Bob Hawke towards the end of September and say `Well, Bob, I am about to announce significant cuts in nuclear tactical weapons and this is going to have an effect on New Zealand, of course, and I neither confirm nor deny that a treaty is up for deliberation. It is going to embarrass the New Zealand Government into trying to change its policy on denying nuclear ships visits. It might have an effect on Australia also regarding the bases.'? Was there some phone call like that that we had not yet heard about? We just do not know what sort of government to government communication there was. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade says there was one: the Minister for Defence says there has been no approach and it is not likely in the future.

         The Minister for Defence is totally unaware, if we are to believe his statements to Senator Spindler and Senator Faulkner yesterday, of these developments. It is interesting too that he was so dismissive of Professor Des Ball's claims, a tactic the previous Minister for Defence also used against Professor Ball's findings about Nurrungar's SDI links, which of course they have not bothered to refute in detail or in substance. That would give too much away. But Professor Ball is generally recognised as the expert in Australia on the operation of the US bases in this country. His research is painstaking and he is not likely to make empty or extravagant claims. As I said, the Government has never before proved him wrong. Whether there are Soviet personnel due to visit Nurrungar or not is beside the point. What is very significant is the proposal to share information gleaned through Pine Gap and Nurrungar with the Soviets or anyone else.

         But most of my questions to the Minister today remain unanswered. What about sharing information with other nations? I specifically asked that of the Minister in my question today, and because I had not given him notice he did not answer. These are meant to be questions without notice and one would think the Minister in charge of foreign affairs would know enough about his portfolio to be able to answer a question about this matter when it has been so much in the news lately. I asked him particularly: does the current proposal, if indeed there is one, extend to the British, the French, the Chinese or other countries concerned about the proliferation of ballistic missiles? There are 20 or so other countries either approaching or with ballistic missile capability. Are they also going to be privy to information gleaned through Pine Gap and Nurrungar?  It would not be a bad idea if, as I said, it was to be used for peaceful purposes. What about the power of veto resting with Australia? That part of the question, of course, was totally ignored. Of course, it is far too embarrassing because we know very well that Australia has never in the past insisted on the power of veto and, as I framed it in my question today, if the joint facilities were used, if information from them was used in a regional war situation that the Australian Government did not approveâ€”a long shot I know but, as I said, we must live in hope that such things are possibleâ€”what about that? What about the situation if the Soviet Union was privy to information from Nurrungar? Would the Soviets be able to use that for use of ballistic missiles against one of the republics within the Soviet Union in their internal conflict situation, which could escalate?  Would Australia use the power of veto in that situation?  The Minister absolutely ignored that part of the question.

         If, as the Minister for Defence would have us believe, we have an independent foreign policyâ€”as he was so proudly proclaiming at the launch of his new book just two days agoâ€”Australia should have the power of veto. After all, these are bases on our soil. Do we automatically get involved in any conflict which the United States gets involved with?  I know that we have not actually had anything to say of a negative kind about their adventures in Korea, Vietnam, Granada or the Gulf, and that is an unfortunate part of our history. It could occur in the future that we do not actually agree with the Americans. Are they going to pass on the information to other nations with whom they are in alliance but with whom we are not, as happened in the Gulf war? Australia's so-called policy of neutrality was breached during the Gulf war by the United States passing on information to its allies with whom we have no defence agreements. Now that is not a situation of a country which has an independent foreign policy. The Minister for Defence, of course, also likes to claim that we have an independent defence capability within an alliance framework. There is nothing independent about either, when, as this fiasco reveals, neither Minister is clear about what is going on regarding US bases on Australian soil. It is an absolute disgrace.

         The only good report in today's news is that President Bush will not be visiting Australia next month. Thank goodness. The taxpayers might be saved a bit of taxpayers' money. It was going to cost at least $1m for members of the House of Representatives to be brought back to Canberra so that they could kowtow and ooh and ah for President Bush, as well as provide President Bush with the opportunity to address a joint sitting of parliament. This is not the Australian way of doing things when visiting heads of state come here. But this is what the Prime Minis-

However, thankfully, we will be spared the humiliating spectacle of our Prime Minister grovelling to the United States President on Australian soil, and that is a small mercy for which we must be grateful.

        (1) and (2) The difficulties in providing cost estimates of certain tax expenditures because of the unavailability of data, or the unreasonable cost that preparation of an estimate would involve, are acknowledged in the Government's annual Tax Expenditures Statement. The streamlining of the income tax collection process over recent years by the Australian Taxation Office in order to reduce the burden on taxpayers in submitting their income tax returns has meant that less information is now provided regarding the specific deductions utilised by taxpayers.

        Nevertheless, where data are unavailable from income tax returns, as would be the case for most new tax expenditures introduced, the Treasury is often able, with the assistance of the Australian Taxation Office, to provide an estimate of the general magnitude of the revenue impact of the introduction of a new tax expenditure, or of the change to an existing tax expenditure, using other statistical material. Resources have not been devoted to this task at this time, but would be if the policy were to come under review.

        (1) The income tax rates schedule for pensioners is the same as for taxpayers generally, and provides a tax free threshold of $5,400. In addition, persons who qualify for a full or part Australian Social Security pension have access to the pensioner rebate, which can extinguish tax liabilities where income is in excess of the $5,400 tax free threshold. In 1991-92, the pensioner rebate will enable single pensioners to earn non-pension income of up to $42 per week and married pensioners up to $74 per week combined, and pay no income tax. The rebate is not identical to additional tax free threshold as the rebate is progressively withdrawn where incomes exceed these levels.

Retired persons, including those in receipt of a United Kingdom pension, who satisfy the age and residency requirements are eligible to receive a full or part Australian pension, at a level determined by the pensioner income and assets tests. Those who are in receipt of a taxable Australian repatriation or social security pension, would be eligible for the pensioner rebate, at a level determined by their taxable income. Those who are not in receipt of an Australian repatriation or social security pension, would not be eligible for the pensioner rebate.
