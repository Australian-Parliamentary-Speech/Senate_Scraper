Can the Minister state what the Government's policy is with regard to both the 1991 and future AIDEX exhibitions in Australia and what would be the consequences for Australian defence and the defence industry in Australia if the parliamentary left's views were to prevail?

         —-The characterisation that there is only one group in politics that is not keen on AIDEX is not correct. I know Senator Spindler is also interested in this particular issue. The Government's attitude is that it is an exhibition run by a private company. It is not Government sponsored per se, although we do have one or two small exhibitions from DSTO and another element at AIDEX 91.

       <para>
        As I have been minded to say to Senator Durack on many occasions, I do not believe that the exhibition of arms or material on arms is the relevant question for this Government. I regard the relevant question as the proper and stringent export controls by which government policy can be applied very selectively to make sure any arms exports go to areas of stability, traditional allies and areas that have a good human rights record. With that in mind, I therefore draw that distinction.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can understand that people who have spent many years in the peace movement would oppose, per se, an arms exhibition. I do not share that view. I share the sentiments of their goodwill about trying to bring about worldwide disarmament. I have no quarrel with that. But I do believe that there is not much difference between having an exhibition and having the same type of materiel portrayed in magazines, by personal representation or by lobbying.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind those that do oppose it that the critical aspect is whether one has proper and stringent export controls. That is the way this Government has sought to treat this particular matter and will continue to do so in future.

In view of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1991 being awarded to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, can the Minister advise, firstly, whether he believes that the Nobel Peace Prize for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will improve the opportunities for Burma to achieve democracy? Secondly, is the Australian Government making efforts in the United Nations and ASEAN to put pressure on the military regime in Burma to hand over power to the democratically elected National League for Democracy?  Thirdly, will the Australian Government demand that the military regime immediately release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners? Fourthly, in recognition of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and her unswerving efforts to achieve democracy in Burma, will the Australian Government extend an official invitation to her to visit Australia?

        <para in-line="1">
         —-I am sure that all Australians would share my delight at the news of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We, as a government--and I am sure that I do so on behalf of all the Australian people--extend to her and to the people of Burma our congratulations on this very great honour.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The conferring of the award does demonstrate the enormous respect that Aung San Suu Kyi has earned from the international community for her very great moral courage and determination to bring about political reform in Burma. It should bring home in very clear terms to the SLORC, the governing military regime, the strong international concern about the situation in Burma and should also lend some hope to the Burmese people. Coupled with the very clear results of the elections that were held in May last year and the continuing international pressure, the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize should improve opportunities for Burma to achieve democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly, as to the more specific second part of the question about Australian Government efforts, we are participating actively in international efforts to persuade the military regime to implement democratic reform and to observe human rights. At the current UN General Assembly we intend to co-sponsor a resolution on Burma and we are working to obtain the widest possible support for that. We are encouraged by the recent statement of the Thai Foreign Minister, Arsa Sarasin, that ASEAN hopes to encourage Burma to make a peaceful transition towards closer integration with other countries in the region. We have been in all our contacts--in my contacts, certainly, with ASEAN Ministers in recent months--reinforcing that view.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, we shall continue to take a prominent stand on Burma at the UN Commission on Human Rights, in view of the continued detention of a number of political prisoners in that country. In this respect, I should say that there was a report today that Professor Yokota, the special representative appointed by the UN Commission, will make his initial visit to Burma before the end of this year. We understand that it is likely that he will request a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi. Whether he gets it is another question, of course. He will submit a report of his visit to the next session of the Commission early next year and we will be watching those developments closely.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also implementing a policy of close coordination with other countries--in Europe, North America and elsewhere--that share our deep concerns about Burma. In regular consultations, we have raised the question of economic sanctions. We realise that such sanctions cannot be effective if they are not supported by the main regional trading partners. That has rather inhibited that effort to date. Similarly, we are advocating an international arms embargo against Burma and the Minister for Defence--it is his responsibility--and I have made clear that we will not be exporting defence and defence related goods to that country.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the third part of the question, about demanding immediate release, it is certainly the case that the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and others discredits the military regime and infringes internationally accepted standards of human rights, certainly in her case. We have consistently called for her release. We have condemned her detention and exclusion from public life. I do so again today. We will continue to demand in vigorous terms her immediate and unconditional release.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the last part of the question, about an invitation to visit Australia, of course it is the case that Aung San Suu Kyi would be a welcome guest in Australia at any time. Given that she is under house detention at the moment, that is not a very practical prospect for the time being. We certainly  will do our best to communicate--if it has not been made clear already by contacts that Senator Schacht and others have had with her--that she would be a very welcome guest.

         —-The question about the progress of the legislation is more appropriately addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. In so far as the Budget implications of the Medicare changes are concerned, I will be able to give Senator Walters a more detailed answer in due course, but let me just say that the overall outlays, the new policy balance, in the 1991-92 Budget change from a reduction of $50m to plus $19m--that is, at Budget time this year the Government had offset all new policy agreed since the 1991 Budget as well as saving a further $50m.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The size of the change and any risk to the overall Budget strategy need to be placed in the proper context; that is, changes at the margin to a Budget with outlays of some $100 billion are not an unusual occurrence. Such a small change would not be likely to alter the Budget strategy. Moreover, it pales into insignificance when viewed against, for example, the $750m change forced on the 1991 Budget by the Opposition, relating to the gas pipeline from Sydney, and the $50m for not supporting changes to family allowance and family allowance supplement assets test criteria.

Firstly, can the Minister confirm that Australia voted for a 1990 resolution of the London Dumping Convention which agreed to stop all sea dumping of industrial waste by the end of 1995 and also that in this year's South Pacific Forum communique Australia commended this decision?

         —-This question appropriately should be directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, but Senator Coulter has asked it of me because of that nifty little part in it about directing the Minister for the Environment to do some particular thing. First of all, let me say that Australia did support the consensus agreement at the thirteenth consultative meeting of contracting parties to the London Dumping Convention in 1990. That resolution provides for the phasing out of sea dumping of industrial wastes by the end of 1995. The Government supported this year's South Pacific Forum's communique commending the London Dumping Convention resolution. So the answer to the first part of Senator Coulter's question is yes.
        </para>

       <para>
        The answer to the second part of the question, as to whether it is agreed that a recent letter from the Environment Minister, Mrs Kelly, to Greenpeace totally discredits Australia's commitment at the London Convention, is no. Australia supports the principle underlying the resolution that the production of waste should be minimised and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. In formulating that resolution, the parties to the London Convention recognised that there were very real difficulties in implementation. Accordingly, the Convention states that `the cessation of dumping of industrial wastes should not result in unacceptable environmental effects elsewhere'. I understand from personal knowledge that there is some debate about that issue taking place in Tasmania at the present time. I think there is a division of opinion amongst environmentalists about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the further point that there is to be an evaluation in 1992 of the consequences of this decision to determine any technical and social difficulties in the adoption of alternative methods of waste management. That resolution has already been copied to EZ, and the company has been put on notice with respect to the 1995 deadline. Clearly, however, there will be a range of issues which the company will need to address to meet this or any earlier deadline. It is not merely an issue of transferring the problem from the sea to the land. The Government and the company are seeking a long term solution that minimises overall environmental impacts.

The Dutch Government has banned sea dumping, as a result of which that company is temporarily placing the waste on land. It is putting its material on land and it has a wide ranging research program on safe disposal. Is the Minister aware of those facts?

The answer to that part of the question is no, I was not aware of that. But, in any event, I regard it as entirely irrelevant. Of course, it will depend upon the circumstances in which alternative measures of disposing of waste are available. Certainly, in Tasmania, there has been a very respectable body of scientific opinion to the effect that the disposal of waste on land is not a simple or satisfactory solution to the issue which arises in respect of EZ.

I am pleased to advise the Senate that the recent meeting of the Transport Advisory Council in Darwin, which comprises Federal and State Ministers for Transport, endorsed the Federal Government's recommendation that this plan should be completely reviewed.   Natplan represents a cooperative effort between the Federal and State governments which is coordinated with similar measures by the oil industry itself. It has operated successfully since its establishment in 1973 and it was instrumental in ensuring a rapid and successful resolution to the Kirki incident.

        From 1 January this year, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority assumed responsibility for Natplan's administration and it is appropriate that the chief executive officer of AMSA, Mr Paul McGrath, will chair the review. The review will also involve senior officers from both Federal and State departments and include representatives from the oil and shipping industries. The review, which it is anticipated will take about six months, will examine levels of risk, equipment and training needs, management issues and the respective responsibilities of government and industry bodies which are involved in an oil spill response situation.

         —-The answer to the first part of that question is: much less so now than was previously the case. Previously, Australia did have a stereotypical image overseas of being dispute prone. But increasingly, as our trading partners have come to realise the changes that this Government has been able to effect in the industrial relations landscape of this country, there has been a recognition that the changes have, in part, succeeded and that our reliability, quality and timeliness are much greater.

       <para>
        However, there are still, in a recidivist way, some problems with the old stereotype and, most typically, they relate to non-English speaking trading partners--specifically, Japan. That is not to say that all Japanese businessmen have that view; they certainly do not. As a consequence of explaining developments in the Australian industrial relations system so that our key trading partner was aware of them, my Department has published a booklet which contains a photograph of a vessel from the North West Shelf which supplies LNG to greater Tokyo. As a mark of confidence in Australia's reliability, that vessel needs to appear on the horizon of Tokyo Bay like clockwork all the time or the lights go down in greater Tokyo. The Japanese have no doubt placed their faith in the reliability of this Australian export. The booklet has been produced as a means of explaining the vast changes that have occurred.

        I am pleased to say that many eminent Australians--among them Alan Jackson of BTR Nylex; Phillip Brass of Pacific Dunlop; Peter Robson of Anderson Rae; Bill Kelty of the ACTU; Peter Newman of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority; Brian Noakes of the Confederation of Australian Industry; John Prescott of BHP; and Martin Ferguson of the ACTU--have all written in this booklet, in their own words, about the vast improvement in Australia's industrial relations performance. The booklet also contains tables most commonly sourced from the OECD which illustrate the changes that have occurred.

        The booklet is a resource manual for Japanese industry, government and union leaders.

It is in great demand and available through both the Australian Embassy in Japan, which collaborated with us in the preparation of the document, and Australian trading houses which deal with Japan. It is in so much demand that when I lead a tripartite mission, which includes Brian Noakes of the Confederation of Australian Industry and Martin Ferguson of the ACTU, to Japan in January under the terms of the Nara treaty, we will have the publication updated so that all of us representing Australia abroad can pull as a team and present an accurate view of the vast changes in industrial relations in this country.

        The murders are an appalling reminder of the tragic circumstances now prevailing in northern Iraq. They have apparently taken place in the context of renewed and widespread fighting between Kurds and the Iraqi Army in several areas of northern Iraq, and against the backdrop of further Turkish hot-pursuits of Kurdish rebels into northern Iraq.
       </para>
       <para>
        A representative of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the main Kurdish parties, is presently visiting Australia to talk to Government representatives and others about the situation of Kurds in Iraq. Mr Hussein Sinjari has been seen by Mr Howe and by Mr Hand, and by officers of my Department and AIDAB. When asked about the massacre, I understand that he expressed his revulsion and extreme regret at what had happened. He believed that Iraqi security was behind the killings; that was his explanation. He further understands that Kurdish groups have begun an inquiry into the massacre.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this context I should note that the leader of the other major Kurdish faction, the Kurdish Democratic Party, Mr Massoud Barzani, has also expressed his abhorrence at the killings.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as the response of the Australian Government is concerned we, of course, condemn in the strongest possible terms any such massacre which may have occurred, and call on all parties to the Kurdish conflict to exercise maximum restraint. Acts of violence of this kind can only serve to set back the already very difficult process of reconciliation and rebuilding that is so badly needed in northern Iraq.

        We have made some substantial aid donations to the Kurdish relief effort, including a total of $3.1m in emergency relief, and sending a team of 75 ADF personnel to northern Iraq for a month at a cost of $4.4m.

       <para>
        United Nations personnel continue to be active in assisting the Iraqi Kurds and monitoring their situation. Ultimately, however, responsibility for the welfare of Kurds and other civilians in Iraq does depend on the Iraqi leadership. We hope that the Iraqi authorities will work with all parties in Iraq to address the needs of the different ethnic and religious groups, and guarantee them the basic human rights for which they have so long waited.

Apparently reliable reports in today's media suggest that finance Ministers at the meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Bangkok have endorsed reductions in spending on farm subsidies.

         —-It does appear from reports of the IMF meeting in Bangkok that there has been a recognition of the importance for the international economy of bringing the Uruguay Round to a speedy conclusion. That is certainly the view that the Treasurer, John Kerin, has been putting to the IMF and World Bank at that meeting. I do understand that the meeting has taken the positive step, as Senator Loosley said, of endorsing a cut in trade subsidies.

       <para>
        The Uruguay Round now appears set to enter its final phase, reflecting the commitment of the G7 leaders made at their London summit to bring the Round to a successful conclusion. It also reflects the pressure by many countries around the world, not least Australia and members of the Cairns Group, for participants to face up to the politically hard decisions that are necessary to conclude the Round. It certainly does seem that the finance Ministers have reinforced this position.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the general state of play on the Round, the Director-General of the GATT, Mr Arthur Dunkel, does plan to table a draft final agreement around mid-November which will contain a package of results across the full Uruguay Round agenda. He has asked the negotiating groups to finalise their contributions by 1 November. The package will reflect agreements reached by the end of 1990, progressed during this year, and proposed solutions to unresolved problems. All participants, once that package is on the table, will then have to decide whether they will make the difficult political decisions needed to unblock the Round, especially in the areas of agriculture, services and market access.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is obviously the case that failure to make an early response to the November proposals as they emerge would be a signal of the inability of participants to finalise the Round before the start of US electoral activity in March next year. That in turn would unquestionably raise a very real question about the future of the Round and therefore, indeed, of the whole multilateral trading system. Certainly, we will have to look at the commitment of the G7 summit to invoke that to resolve key differences among the major developed countries if that sort of scenario starts to unfold. More optimistically, if the necessary decisions are made in November and December, a good result in the early months of 1992 is possible. So the whole thing is really very finely balanced at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Agriculture does remain the key to any successful outcome from the Round. The crucial question remains the extent to which the European Community is prepared to make commitments to reduce domestic support, border protection and export subsidies for its farm products. We have been waiting on significant movement from the European Community for the past five years. It is pleasing--and this was also referred to in Senator Loosley's question--that we saw last week a signal of greater willingness on the part of Germany to move forward on agriculture. That signal is consistent with the message that the bipartisan delegation which Dr Blewett recently led to Europe received from the Germans. However, obviously, if satisfactory progress on agriculture is to be achieved, it is crucial that all member states recognise the urgency of the situation and the importance of a good result to the world trading system as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the negotiations enter this really quite critical final phase, we as an Australian government are taking every opportunity to exert pressure on the major participants to deliver on the various public commitments which they have made repeatedly throughout the Round in general terms to work for an enhanced multilateral trading system. I have already mentioned the bipartisan delegation led by Dr Blewett. The point that we will continue to make over coming weeks is that the time really has come for the participants to match rhetoric, which has been in ample supply over recent years, with real commitments.

I also ask whether the new guidelines would have allowed the international arms smuggler Mohammed Kahan to get away scot-free after a huge arms cache he was about to send to Fiji was discovered in Sydney and whether proceedings will now be commenced against him to deter any intending arms dealers from following his example.

While we are on that question, Senator Spindler at his news conference this morning, by acts of commission, almost implied that AIDEX was a totally Government run exhibition and not a private company. So next time Senator Spindler is on radio--using this as his latest tool to get publicity--I ask him to please make that quite clear and not mislead the public.

       <para>
        As I said in answer to Senator Durack earlier today, if it is moral to import arms, it is moral to export arms. Information on such weaponry may be received from a whole number of sources, that is, by way of magazine articles, advertising, personal contact or exhibition. The critical thing for government policy is not whether people view weapons; it is where they are exported to. That is a matter that we have had revised twice in my time as Minister for Defence because our aspiration is to make the guidelines as good as possible. I am quite happy to defend the past track record. Those guidelines are most stringent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Spindler would note from his question that now government to government sales have also been brought within the guidelines, which was a very positive step. He goes on in his question and asks me then to apply those new criteria to past exports. I am not going to answer such a hypothetical question because all due process would have been gone through--consultation with Foreign Affairs, consideration by the committee, and advice to me both from that committee and my Department. So I have no intention of breaking Standing Orders by answering such a hypothetical question.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Spindler then goes on to ask me about a smuggler. Frankly, we do not grant export licences to smugglers. If Senator Spindler is interested in that subject, he should direct his question to the Minister responsible for Customs, who will no doubt deal with it appropriately. I do not want to be too harsh on Senator Spindler because he has just been allocated the defence portfolio for the Democrats. He has managed to ask me one more question than the shadow Minister has in the whole spring session, so I do not want to discourage him.
       </para>
       <para>
        But I do make this plea to him: being a shadow spokesman either for a main party or for a minority party does involve being negative and constantly carping. I understand that; it is part of the role. But Senator Spindler should also try to play a positive role. He should try once in his tenure as the Democrats' spokesman for defence to comment positively on some defence aspects, and not be seen as anti-defence, carping, anti-American, anti-everything.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Spindler did that right throughout the Gulf war. He did not have an intellectually sustainable position. He was highly embarrassed and I really felt for him in the position in which he was put. But he has been making a big thing about this.

         —-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Land Transport. I ask about the impending establishment of a National Road Transport Commission which will administer changes to heavy vehicle registration charges. At the Special Premiers Conference in July, heads of government, with the exception of the Northern Territory, signed an agreement to establish the NRTC. This agreement required the NRTC to derive a road user charge based on full cost recovery of all fully distributed road costs from commercial vehicles. Part of the agreement, flowing from the Industry Commission report, was that the NRTC must apply for a template to break this total cost between different classes of road users, based on the weight of the vehicle and the distance travelled per year. In light of this agreement to a full cost recovery formula, can the Minister give an unequivocal guarantee that only phase one of the working group's charges will be adopted or will the second phase, to begin in July 1995, have to be introduced to achieve the full cost recovery aim?

People can establish their eligibility for Medicare by completing an enrolment form and obtaining a Medicare card. I understand that it is not necessary for people enrolling in Medicare to attend at a Medicare office to complete the enrolment;  they simply have to provide documentary evidence of identity and residency status and they can be enrolled.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to the particular matter that Senator Crowley has raised, given the number of people enrolled in Medicare, it seems inconceivable that 20 per cent of any doctor's practice would be made up of people who do not have a Medicare number. Perhaps the figure represents the fact that 20 per cent of the centre's clients do not attend the centre with their Medicare card. In this situation a doctor can still direct bill, giving the personal particulars of the patient. Except for a very small percentage of cases, this is sufficient for the Health Insurance Commission to identify the patient and to pay the claim.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know the exact significance of the claim that 5 per cent of the centre's clients are Aboriginals. It may mean to imply that the Aboriginal community constitutes a major component of the bad debts of the practice. As I say, given the ease of being enrolled in Medicare, I do not quite see why the difficulty has arisen. Nevertheless, if there are particular difficulties that the administrators of the centre have identified, they should take up the matter with the Health Insurance Commission.

       <para>
        the upgrading of the nation's communications infrastructure. It will provide a chance for a new high-tech industry in Australia which will provide jobs in programming, retailing and servicing of pay television. And it will create manufacturing opportunities for Australian industry with export potential. I think it is a very popular decision because it gives people more choice. The Government has set out a number of conditions for the operation of pay TV. It will be delivered via at least four channels on Aussat's satellites. An additional two Aussat channels will be made available for the further development of pay TV systems. Strict siphoning rules will ensure that important programs, including national and international sporting events, will continue to be available to free-to-air television. Foreign ownership limits will be applied to ensure that there is majority Australian ownership. At this stage, it is sensible to work these out during the sale process for the right to provide a pay TV service, as the Government did for the sale of Aussat.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further consideration will also be given to cross-media participation, given the strong public concern about concentration of media ownership. Australian content for pay TV will be addressed by the broadcasting regulatory authority established under the proposed broadcasting services Bill and a recommendation made to government.

        The licence for the multi-channel national service will also require the owner to develop a local industry package to maximise Australian industry involvement. Pay TV is also a factor in the sale of Aussat. The satellite is one of the principal options, as I have pointed out--

        Broome is, in fact, designated as an international airport for international airline charter operations. However, under current arrangements, customs, health and immigration clearances can only be provided on a restricted basis sufficient for those charter operations. I am sure that all members of the Opposition would agree that the very significant infrastructure that has to be laid on to clear international flights cannot simply be provided in advance of knowing whether there are going to be any customers or not. Minister Beazley did, in fact, agree for that airport to be designated as an international airport, and it is so designated for charter flights.

        The Government is aware of a long term tourism and trade potential of the Kimberley region. It has already held discussions with Western Australian interests about the possibility of operating programs of charter services between Broome and Singapore. The Australian Customs Service and the Western Australian tourism and transport authorities have also been involved in these discussions. Charter services, if they can be mounted on a commercial basis, will provide a useful indicator of the potential for international services to the region. The Federal Government is prepared to do everything possible to ensure that the market is tested in that way.

         —-Yesterday Senator Newman addressed a question to me regarding Telecom Australia's 0055 service, with a number of very detailed sections about the number of complaints that have been received and the number of services that have been transferred to the new opt-in number. I have been provided with the following response to Senator Newman's question.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Under the new arrangements operating since 1 October, standards for the content of recorded messages are defined in codes of practice. These standards are established by an independent telephone information services standard committee, and an arbitrator will determine whether the codes have been contravened and advise on the course of action to be taken. Such action could include either modification of the message, transferral to the opt-in 0051 closed user access service, or removal.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised by Telecom that, as the new arrangements are still in the process of being implemented fully, it is still unclear how many of the services currently on 0055 will need to be transferred to the new 0051 service. However, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, has recently written to the chairman of Telecom expressing his concern that community views on these issues be addressed adequately and seeking an assurance that implementation of the arbitrator's rulings will be given a high priority. The Minister is currently awaiting advice from Telecom concerning implementation of these procedures.

        —-During the adjournment debate in the Senate last night I counselled Senator Bishop, as she was developing an argument in relation to a question asked on 5 September by Senator Crowley of the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, that:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is not proper to impute an improper motive of misleading the Senate, Senator Bishop. You might be able to say it slightly differently.
      </para>
      <para>
       Upon Senator Bishop's suggestion to me that she was:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . proceeding now to show how he did mislead the Senate. . .
      </para>
      <para>
       the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) took a point of order to the effect that Senator Bishop should be asked to withdraw her remark in accordance with my initial ruling. I then ruled as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not proper to accuse a Minister of misleading the Senate. Senator Bishop, you may wish to say that he may have misled the Senate or inadvertently misled the Senate, but I will not permit you to say that a Minister misled the Senate.
      </para>
      <para>
       After some cross-chamber discussion, I suggested that Senator Bishop continue her speech. Later in the debate the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) asked me to undertake some research into the matter, advise of the results and inform the Senate of whether I would wish to stand by the precedent.
      </para>
      <para>
       In making this statement I point out, as Odgers has done in the sixth edition of Australian Senate Practice, that:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . it is important that any example of unparliamentary language be considered in its context.
      </para>
      <para>
       That appears on page 217. Odgers went on to state that:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . some expressions may be inelegant but not necessarily objectionable.
      </para>
      <para>
       The converse, however, also holds, namely, that in its context an expression normally not unparliamentary could be objectionable. While I accept Senator Hill's point that the word `misled' is not in itself unparliamentary, I draw attention to the context in which Senator Bishop used the word. She had indicated that the Minister had:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . quite deliberately set up a question from Senator Crowley with the direct objective of maligning Robe River Mining.
      </para>
      <para>
       She then went on to say that she had taken a point of order, at the time Senator Cook rose to answer the question, as to whether the Minister was speaking as a Minister of the Crown or as a paid-up union employee. In that context, I considered that Senator Bishop's use of the word `misled' implied deliberate misleading.
      </para>
      <para>
       I draw attention to the ruling of President Givens, quoted at page 218 of Australian Senate Practice, that it is:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . unparliamentary to insinuate or say that a Senator has made an untrue statement knowing it to be untrue.
      </para>
      <para>
       I consider last night's incident to be analogous and stand by the ruling I made. I emphasise, however, that in normal circumstances I accept that the word `misled' is not in itself unparliamentary.

       Telecom:  0055 Services

       (1)  Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.

       (3)  These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.

       Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.

       <para>
        Croatian Australians and their many supporters are most disturbed to hear that your government has forwarded $100,000 to the Yugoslavian Red Cross despite our warnings that no money via the Yugoslavian Red Cross is reaching the victims of the war in Croatia.
       </para>
       <para>
        You will recall that Croatian representatives informed you of this situation at a meeting at Kirribilli House on July 31. Since then hundreds of Croats have died or been injured at the hands of Serbian terrorists backed by the Yugoslav army. As you are well aware the Yugoslav Government has now admitted that the army is out of control and acting illegally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week representatives of Australian Croatians spoke to several doctors working around the clock in hospitals in Zagreb. These doctors confirmed that no money had been forthcoming from the Red Cross in Belgrade to assist in the crisis. As the conflict is in Croatia and the wounded and refugees are there, not in Belgrade, we are at a loss to understand why the Australian Government donation was not sent directly via the Australian Red Cross to where it is needed in Croatia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We strongly deplore the ill-considered action in sending funds to Belgrade despite our clear warnings.
       </para>
       <para>
        We noted that you have also ignored our request to recall the Australian Ambassador to Yugoslavia so he can give an up to date briefing to the Government on the current situation in Croatia. We cannot accept that it is too expensive for him to fly to Australia for a week. We note you flew the former Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Brian Burke, back to Australia earlier this year to attend a court case that was not even a Federal matter!
       </para>
       <para>
        We have also noted that you did not deem it fit to send an Australian observer to European Community peace talks although countries such as Sweden and Canada, which also have large communities of citizens of Croatian descent, did so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prime Minister, we do not expect Australia to take up arms in relation to this conflict but we do expect to see more positive and effective action from a Government which represents up to half a million Australians who have connections with Croatia. These people have helped make this country what it is and have been solid, hardworking and committed Australian citizens. They are becoming increasingly distressed and disturbed at your Government's inertia and lack of compassion towards events in Croatia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are even more puzzled and angered when we recall that Australia whole heartedly supported and rushed to the defence of Kuwait. We ask no more for Croatia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Croatians are looking to you personally, Mr Hawke, to take concrete action, either politically or financially, to acknowledge and resolve the current situation in Croatia. We see this issue as a crucial test of your stature on human rights and peoples rights to self determination. Our support for your Government could well depend on your response.

         The document read as follows--
        </para>
        <para>
         The report was tabled in the House on 18 October 1990, by the Committee Chairman, the Honourable Member for Herbert, and in the Senate on 17 October 1990 by the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, Senator Vanstone. As the Committee puts it, the tabling of this Report is pursuant to the Committee's obligation to maintain a system of accountability under Section 55(1)(b) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The report was accompanied by a Qualifying Statement by the Members for Gippsland and Moore, and Senators Crichton-Browne and Vanstone.
        </para>
        <para>
         The report deals with an investigation in South Australia by the National Crime Authority (NCA). The Report makes no findings and no recommendations. While the Qualifying Statement also does not advance recommendations, it suggests that aspects of Operation Ark are relevant to the Committee's current Evaluation Inquiry and should be discussed further in that context. I also note that, in a tabling statement agreed by the Committee and tabled in both Houses on 21 February 1991, the Committee indicated that "it would neither be constructive for it to reconsider the Operation Ark case, nor to attempt further adjudication on the conflicting claims about the status of the NCA Operation Ark report at 30 June 1989". The Committee went on to indicate that it would address issues arising from changes in membership of the NCA in the context of its Evaluation Inquiry. These are matters for the Committee to decide, and do not call for a response from the Government.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government accepts the Joint Parliamentary Committee's Majority Report. There is concern, however, about aspects of the Qualifying Statement signed by four members of the Committee, Senator N Crichton-Browne, Mr P Filing MP, Mr P McGauran MP and Senator A Vanstone.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government wishes to make clear that it supports the right of members of committees to add protesting or dissenting views to committee reports. Indeed, standing order 343 of the House permits this. The Government cannot, however, approve of a procedure under which a dissenting report, without the authority of the Committee, discloses in camera evidence--as occurred in the present case.
        </para>
        <para>
         I understand that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure has expressed the view that procedures should be put in place to avoid the disclosure of in camera evidence in dissenting reports unless authorised by the relevant committee. This view is supported by the Government.
        </para>
        <para>
         In its report of 2 May 1989, the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure suggested certain guidelines be followed by Senators who wished to refer in a dissenting report to evidence taken in camera. It recommended inter alia:
        </para>
        <para>
         -  the Senator should advise the Committee of the evidence concerned and all reasonable efforts should be made by the Committee to reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for this purpose;
        </para>
        <para>
         -  witnesses involved should, if practicable, be informed of the proposed disclosure and given reasonable opportunity to object; and
        </para>
        <para>
         -  consideration should be given to disclosing the evidence in such a way as to conceal the identity of persons who gave or are referred to in evidence.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government observes that these recommendations were not followed in the present case.
        </para>
        <para>
         Moreover, the debate on 13 February 1991 concerning the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure also emphasised the need to limit disclosure of purely operational material to the wider public--particularly with the aim of protecting witnesses.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government believes it is important to maintain the confidentiality of persons who assist the Authority by way of information. The Authority's position is based on a long-standing practice it has adopted with my approval out of concern for the safety of witnesses and informants. This principle must necessarily extend to those who appear and give evidence before the Committee. If the confidentiality of those co-operating with the Committee is not upheld and respected, then there is a danger that the willingness of those who might otherwise provide information would be diminished. The Government is concerned to ensure that the reputation and the standing of committees is not diminished by unauthorised minority disclosure of information received on a confidential basis.

          —-I wish to speak briefly to the Government's response to the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority on Operation Ark. I wish to speak briefly because the response is so weak that it does not deserve much time, but there are a couple of points that require comment. The Government says that it agrees with the majority report, and then proceeds in its response to make some critical remarks clearly directed at those senators and members who chose to put in a qualifying statement.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         It is perfectly fair for people to have views about the conduct of one or other member or senator and the manner in which that person has chosen to go about his or her business. But should people choose to make remarks, one could at least expect that they do so without misrepresenting the situation and that they tell the whole story, not just a part of it. I do not say `tell the whole story' to indicate that that is what I now wish to do. But I do want to draw attention to those areas where I believe the Government in its response has not been as frank as it should have been, has told perhaps the truth but not the whole truth and, in doing so, has given a picture other than the true picture to those who might read it.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government says on page 2 of its response:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government can not, however, approve of a procedure under which a dissenting report, without the authority of the Committee, discloses in camera evidence--as occurred in the present case.
        </para>
        <para>
         What the Government does not say following that is that at the time that happened, the process undertaken by myself, Senator Crichton-Browne, Mr Filing and Mr McGauran was not in any way conflicting with Senate Standing Orders or guidelines. It implies that what was done then, and could not be done now, should not have been done because in some way it was in contravention of the Senate Standing Orders. I therefore think it would have been appropriate for the Government to perhaps outline a little more clearly the discussions that have been had over the use of in camera evidence in reports to this chamber.
        </para>
        <para>
         It would have been even more colourful if the Government had chosen to make some remarks about whether chairmen of committees can disclose in camera evidence at their will or can actually say at a public hearing, `The committee has decided that this evidence has been released. Is that all right with you, Joe Bloggs?'. Joe Bloggs, who is sitting there, has given some in camera evidence to the committee in the past. He is now at a public hearing and the chairman is referring to in camera evidence he has given at previous private hearings. The chairman may say, `The committee has decided that this should be released, is that all right with you?' when the committee has not consulted the witness. That in camera evidence is then released with quite disastrous consequences.
        </para>
        <para>
         As I understand it, the reason why the Government would not turn its mind to that type of activity was that the only time this had happened was under a Labor chairman and not that long ago. It is certainly within the memory of this Government and it is clearly embedded in the memory of any member of this Committee.
        </para>
        <para>
         It seems that the Government is prepared to say with respect to Opposition members, `Tut, tut, you should not go about your business this way', but when one of its members, who is a chairman of the Committee, has chosen by either sheer ignorance and incompetence or design--I am not sure which--to release a whole swag of in camera evidence which had quite serious consequences which are not worth going into now, the Government chooses to remain silent. It is quite amazing. In that respect, this is a quite misleading response to that report.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government refers on page 2 of its response to a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure in May 1989. It does this to try to give the impression that, at the time of this report being released and the qualifying statement being put with it, the report applied and was endorsed by the Senate. Of course it was not. As I understand it, when that report came forward, it was sent back. Why? Because former Senator Peter Baume, who is no longer in this place, asked how a committee would resolve the situation where a member or a number of minority members wanted to release some in camera evidence or wanted to put something in a majority report or in a qualifying statement and the majority said no. At that stage, no method was devised of resolving such an impasse. Consequently, as I understand it, the matter was referred back to the Committee. But it certainly was not endorsed by this chamber at that time.
        </para>
        <para>
         Things have moved on since then and now, if one wishes to disclose in camera evidence, there is a list of things that one needs to do. I do not deny that, although I have perhaps different views from some people on the procedures that we should move to adopt in the future. The fact is that things have moved on. One would now need to advise people that one was going to release some in camera evidence and give them an opportunity to say why that should not happen. But when we read this Government response, we do not get the slightest hint that that was not the case at the time that this report was tabled. On page 3 of the response, the Government says:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . the debate on 13 February 1991 concerning the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure also emphasised the need to limit disclosure of purely operational material to the wider public. . .
        </para>
        <para>
         I have not gone back and pursued the Hansard of that date. No doubt someone did raise a concern about the need to limit disclosure of purely operational material. But why is this piece of information in a Government response to a committee report? What was said in the Senate on 13 February 1991 does not impact on what was said in that report at all. The report says that a member of the Senate--perhaps a couple--got up and had this particular view.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think I can give the answer as to why the Government has chosen to refer to a debate in February this year when it is responding to a report put out in October last year. By referring to the debate in February this year the Government wants to create the impression--I think it has deliberately gone about doing this--that some of the in camera evidence revealed in the qualifying statement was somehow material that should have been kept from the public for reasons other than agreed administrative practice in this place; that is, that it was operational material that could potentially have put someone at risk in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth.
        </para>
        <para>
         On a number of occasions I, I think Senator Crichton-Browne and no doubt someone in the other place have challenged members of the Government, in relation to this exercise that we all had hoped could be put behind us, to point to one piece of information that is other than of an administrative nature; to point to one piece of information that does contain operational material. That has not been done because it cannot be done. The only information that was revealed in that qualifying statement is information that I still believe should have been revealed. The only embarrassment is that it was not revealed to this chamber earlier. The embarrassment is that the Committee took so long to report to this Parliament on a very disastrous time during the NCA's operation in Adelaide.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government says also on page 3 of its response, as a sort of parting remark, that it is concerned to ensure that the reputation and the standing of committees is not diminished by unauthorised minority disclosure of information received on a confidential basis. I would like to have seen the Government add to that that it was concerned to ensure that the reputation and the standing of committees is not diminished by Government members on those committees behaving merely as the lackeys of the Executive.
        </para>
        <para>
         We need to understand that in this place, for quite proper reasons, the Government has the majority on committees. Is the Government, therefore, to be allowed to say yea or nay to what this Parliament can be told?  Individual members of committees need to be prepared to say to their own executives, `Well, tough. I think you have made a mistake and the Parliament has to know about that mistake'. If committees continue to operate as this Committee has, what will happen when a committee comes across something that the Executive has done or is responsible for having allowed to happen--some sort of scandal that this Parliament should know about?  Nothing will happen. Parliament will not be told because the majority of the committee members are the lackeys of the Executive, unwilling to tackle any task that might embarrass the Executive by revealing some sort of incompetence on its part.

          —-Senator Walters interjects that it used not to be like that and--if we want to put it that way--in plenty of jurisdictions it is not like that. We all watched, with some fascination, as Ollie North gave his evidence to a United States committee on the Iran-Contra affair. Quite rightly, United States parliamentary committees got stuck into the Hart scandal. One can think of other examples in the United Kingdom and no doubt in other parliaments where parliamentary committees have not forgotten their responsibility, which is, in part, to oversee and keep a check on the Executive.

         If members of a governing party--that is, the party from which the Executive is formed--form a majority on a committee, and those people do not see themselves as parliamentarians but rather as Executive aspirants, willing to do the bidding of their leader or relevant Minister so as to protect their own path to the Executive, one has to query very substantially whether parliamentary committees are doing their job.
        </para>
        <para>
         I see that we have a number of schoolchildren here. No doubt they are told that this place, in part, keeps a check on the Executive. Have they considered whether they would have the courage to dob on their own--their leader would be the Prime Minister and their colleagues would form the Ministry--were they members of a party in government? That is what it amounts to.
        </para>
        <para>
         I have not had the experience of being in government. I do not want it to be said that I look forward to the opportunity of dobbing on my own; that would be the wrong way of putting it. I face that prospect with some apprehension. But I like to think that I would have the courage to do it. I do not want to be so rude as to say that the other members of this Committee do not.
        </para>
        <para>
         The National Crime Authority had, by one story, presented a report relating to police corruption in South Australia. We had a change of membership, with the new membership saying, `That wasn't a report'. It offered a variety of reasons why technically it had not been concluded. I do not mean to say that I accept those reasons at all. Therefore, that report was not put forward. A doctored version--a very substantially watered-down version--was then presented to the Government. This matter came to light only by virtue of the fact that the media found that there were two Operation Ark reports. Quite serious haggling, wrangling and quite extraordinary manoeuvres had gone on in the Authority to make sure the first report never went forward.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is now an historical matter: both reports are in the hands of the South Australian Attorney. One might argue that we are in the position we would have been in had the first report been accepted, because the South Australian Attorney knows full well its contents. But of course it is not the task of this Committee simply to check that the South Australian Attorney knows what he should know. One of the tasks of this Committee is to report on the operation of the Authority. The haggling within the Authority over those two reports was a disgraceful and deplorable event, surpassed only by the unwillingness of this Committee to report as soon as it should have on that matter.
        </para>
        <para>
         In conclusion, this response is pretty limp-wristed; it certainly does not address the point. It highlights this Government's desire to have every government member do its bidding in parliamentary committees and its desire to reduce parliamentary committees to nothing more than the yea or nay of what the Executive says--and that is a problem. It reveals a desire to not be fully frank with this chamber and those who might read this report, because it does not outline clearly the procedural situation at the time this report was tabled and the qualifying statement was put in. Nor does it properly outline the changes since then. In that respect, it is a very deceitful response.

          --I wish to comment briefly on the Government's response to the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on Operation Ark. I do so as a member of that Committee. I express some disappointment, as Senator Vanstone did, with the content of the Government response. It hardly warrants any further comment.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         However, I would like to comment briefly on some matters of substance. A brief history might be useful. It was not until December 1989 that the Committee became aware of a National Crime Authority operation in South Australia codenamed Operation Ark. We became aware of that due to some media reports. We subsequently became aware that there were indeed, as Senator Vanstone has said, two reports: one prepared and authorised by the outgoing Chairman of the NCA, Mr Justice Stewart, and one authorised and officially dispatched by Mr Faris, who took over as Chairman of the NCA.
        </para>
        <para>
         The first comment to be made is that the internal dispute in the NCA about which of the two reports was the valid one points to the need to reform the handing over procedures whenever a chairman, or in fact the administration, of the NCA changes. That aspect has been noted during the evaluation by the Committee of the work of the NCA, and it will be addressed in that report. I express confidence that, with the present Chairman and administration of the NCA, we will avoid a recurrence of such an unsatisfactory procedure.
        </para>
        <para>
         Seeing I have had the opportunity to look at both reports, it might be useful to comment briefly on the quality of the two reports. From a cursory reading and without being able to enter into a detailed investigation of the facts that were the subject of that report, certainly, the first report prepared by Mr Le Grand, went into some detail on the subject matter of Operation Ark.
        </para>
        <para>
         We should note that Operation Ark arose from the conduct of members of the South Australian Police Force during Operation Noah in 1989 where telephoned information, at least in 13 cases, dealing with the alleged involvement of police officers, was not passed on to the head of the South Australian Police Force. This came to light only at a later stage.
        </para>
        <para>
         The first report deals in some detail with these cases. It names police officers. I believe that Mr Faris considered that the charges made in that report could not be sustained by the information included in it. Be that as it may, one must admit that the second report was very slight, very bland. It did not give a lot of information. It would have been of concern to me had that been the only report provided.
        </para>
        <para>
         Under its terms of reference the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is not entitled to review the findings of the NCA. However, that does not prevent the Committee from examining the methods by which the NCA arrives at its conclusions. If that reflects upon its ultimate findings, so be it.
        </para>
        <para>
         On a matter of substance, I had the opportunity to look at the first report as well as at the second report. The first seven cases were investigated by the NCA and by the South Australian police, and satisfactory answers were provided. Subsequently, there were six cases left which had not been dealt with in evidence before the NCA Committee, and written questions on notice were placed before the present head of the NCA, Mr Justice Phillips, at my request. The answers have since been received. They are not being released publicly, and I agree with that course of action. It remains to be noted that, in four cases out of the six, allegations were made that police officers had actually been involved in drug trafficking or in assisting drug traffickers. The reports found that in all four cases this was not proven and that no further action was considered necessary.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is not a reflection upon these investigations by the NCA or upon the South Australian Police Force when I say that, following evidence by the South Australian police before the Committee, I formed the view that it is not satisfactory to have charges against police officers investigated by other police officers. We now have an internal investigating agency in the South Australian Police Force. But it seems to be an incontrovertible principle that, where charges are made against members of an organisation which affect members of the community outside, such charges should not be investigated by other members of the organisation but by an independent authority.
        </para>
        <para>
         I would confirm the position of the Australian Democrats that every State police force should be answerable to, and if necessary members of such a force should be investigated by, an independent authority established by the Government in each State. I trust that we will ultimately reach that particular position.
        </para>
        <para>
         I refer to that part of the Government's response which refers to the release of in camera evidence in the dissenting reports by members of the Opposition who are members of the Committee. It must be of some concern to us that our present rules allow in camera evidence to be disclosed in Parliament and, therefore, to the public. The principle is that if witnesses who appear before parliamentary committees choose to give evidence in camera, they should be protected. There is a case of natural justice that such a request should be honoured but it is also a matter of practical orientation. It seems that parliamentary committees cannot expect to get worthwhile, sensitive evidence if these witnesses cannot ultimately be assured of the protection of confidentiality.
        </para>
        <para>
         I am aware of the set of guidelines that were agreed to as put forward by the Procedure Committee. I note that in most cases every possible precaution is being taken and all possible caution and sensitivity are being exercised before such evidence is disclosed. The nub of the matter is that ultimately, although we have gone through all of these steps, such evidence may still be disclosed.
        </para>
        <para>
         It may well be a matter of public interest which should override the private concerns of witnesses and the practical considerations of getting witnesses to appear before parliamentary committees. This is something that we will have to test as time goes by. We may never know, of course, because some witnesses may simply not be prepared to appear and, if they do appear, may withhold evidence since they cannot be assured that it will remain confidential. But it is a time for testing and I have no doubt that that issue will be revisited in this chamber.
        </para>
        <para>
         In adopting these guidelines and safeguards it is absolutely essential that witnesses appearing before committees to give evidence in camera are advised at the beginning of the hearing that, although they have been granted an in camera hearing, such evidence may be disclosed and that they may not be in a position to stop such disclosure. From my own observation, I believe that this procedure is not always followed in committees and I wish to place it on the record that in the circumstances it is absolutely essential that this be done.
        </para>
        <para>
         I look forward to the completion of the report by the NCA Committee on the evaluation of the workings of the NCA, which I trust will throw some light on the direction in which the NCA will be travelling from now on and will provide some evidence of the work that the Committee is carrying out in discharging its duties to supervise the workings of the NCA on behalf of both the Parliament and the community.

          —-I respond to the Government response to the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on Operation Ark. The Government has trivialised the report, has been offensive in its response to the minority report and has been crudely partisan in its comments.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         In respect to the majority report, it simply notes the content of the report. In respect to the minority report, it does not seek to refute any of the facts or debate the facts. All it does is criticise the minority report for disclosing in camera evidence which was done in strict accordance with Standing Orders of the Senate.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) criticises that conduct on the false basis that the dissenting report contained in camera evidence without that being disclosed and without the approval of the majority of the Committee. I accept that under the hybrid Westminster system that we have in Australia the Parliament does not have any independence in its final determinations because, sad as that might be, the government of the day is the parliament of the day.
        </para>
        <para>
         I find it thoroughly offensive for a government to assume that, if a member of a committee seeks to express a point of view, it requires the imprimatur of the majority. There is nothing new about this notion. It has been looked at on previous occasions, in previous parliaments, including in the House of Commons, I think. I find it fundamentally obnoxious for the chief law enforcement officer in this land to assert that the committee members in the minority are unable to report their findings, their deliberations and their determinations to the Parliament without the approval of those in the majority. To the extent that the Attorney-General attended the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and made it clear that he wanted the matter of Operation Ark brushed aside, it was inevitable that the majority of the members on the Committee would do his bidding; that is, do less than was necessary to address a very important and fundamental matter relating to Operation Ark.
        </para>
        <para>
         I should say that, as a result of the disclosure of certain administrative matters which were given in camera--not because there was anything special, unique or secretive about them, but simply because that has been the procedure used thus far by the Committee--this chamber has referred the evidence of two members of the National Crime Authority to the Committee of Privileges on the basis that, prima facie, it would appear that two members of the National Crime Authority misled the Committee.
        </para>
        <para>
         Presumably, that is what the Attorney-General finds offensive. Had we not tabled in camera evidence, that revelation would not have been before the Parliament and this chamber would not have been in a position to move the motion that it did. The response to that was that the Attorney-General, the first law officer of Australia, complained that the evidence had come to the notice of the chamber. Had it been done with the approval of the Authority, that evidence would have not seen the light of day.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is a very good reason for that evidence being made available. It showed, highlighted and contrasted the fundamental difference between the anaemic and inadequate report tabled by the majority of the members of the Committee and the substance which was disclosed in the minority report. As Senator Spindler has said, the majority report accepted the claim by the then head of the NCA, Mr Faris, that the first report on Operation Ark was not a complete report. It accepted that notion in spite of the fact that Justice Stewart, Mr Le Grand and Mr Robberds had claimed to the contrary.
        </para>
        <para>
         We were not given an opportunity to pursue that matter because Justice Stewart was denied an opportunity to appear before the Committee, as were Mr Le Grand and Mr Robberds. The three of them had a view contrary to that presented in the majority report, but the majority of members on the Committee, notwithstanding the pleadings of myself and others, refused to take their evidence. The result was that when the majority and the minority reports were tabled Justice Stewart wrote to the Committee expressing some offence at the inadequacy of the findings and disputing matters of fact portrayed in the majority report. In a comprehensive letter, he dissected the majority report and exposed it for what it was.
        </para>
        <para>
         As a result, the majority of members on the Committee felt sufficiently chastened, embarrassed and obliged to call Justice Stewart. For the time being I am not in a position to disclose what he had to say or the pleadings of those in the majority as to what they should do to correct the wrong. If my memory serves me correctly, Justice Stewart, when asked by me whether he would be unhappy about any of his evidence being made public, said, `Absolutely not'; he had nothing to hide. Thus far we have not heard from Mr Le Grand or Mr Robberds. It is my judgment that the majority of the members of the Committee have now sneakily come to the conclusion that there was a fundamental flaw in the majority report and that there was a fundamental failure on behalf of the Committee in not calling those witnesses.
        </para>
        <para>
         I conclude by saying that it seems to me that this Government has an appalling lack of understanding of procedures to assert that in camera evidence ought not to be disclosed in a minority report when it is intrinsic to the arguments presented in the minority report. In this case, as I assume in every other occasion when in camera evidence is attached to a minority report, it is done simply to buttress the report. In this case they were administrative matters. They were not even quasi-operational. They certainly were not operational matters.
        </para>
        <para>
         Justice Phillips, if I recall, subsequently responded. He was moved to respond because a member of the Committee, Mr O'Keefe, following the tabling of the minority report, burst into the House of Representatives and made some outrageous claims misrepresenting the position of Mr Justice Phillips, Mr Justice Phillips being the Chairman of the National Crime Authority and a previous member of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Mr Justice Phillips made it quite clear that he was unaffected, not offended, and that the relationships between the NCA and the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority were not in any way compromised by the tabling of the minority report. As a result of his quite firm and, I might say, quite remarkable rebuttal of Mr O'Keefe's clearly incorrect assertion, Mr O'Keefe returned to the chamber and apologised for misleading the Parliament in respect of the matters he had raised which reflected upon both Mr Justice Phillips and those signatories to the minority report.
        </para>
        <para>
         Presumably, this matter will be raised again when the present reference to the Committee--dealing with the effectiveness of the National Crime Authority--is tabled. No doubt we will have a full and more wholesome debate than that which we are having at the present time.

          --I will be brief in my remarks. There are just one or two points that I would like to make. We are dealing with the response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority regarding Operation Ark. It is not my intention to go back and debate this matter because Senator Crichton-Browne has raised some of the points that were contained in the report, but I think it is important to point out that the response from the Government recognises the majority report and also the qualifying statement--the minority report--put down by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Vanstone.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         It is worth while noting that paragraph two of the Government response states very clearly:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Report deals with an investigation in South Australia by the National Crime Authority. The Report--
        </para>
        <para>
         that is, the report of the National Crime Authority--
        </para>
        <para>
         makes no findings and no recommendations.
        </para>
        <para>
         Then it recognises the qualifying statement:
        </para>
        <para>
         While the Qualifying Statement also does not advance recommendations, it suggests that aspects of Operation Ark are relevant to the Committee's current Evaluation Inquiry and should be discussed further in that context.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is the key to the response by the Government. It recognises the report and the fact that it gave no recommendations; but it also recognises the minority report and the fact that it made a suggestion that the matter should be further discussed in the context of the evaluation inquiry which is being undertaken by the Committee. As a member of the Joint Committee there is no doubt in my mind--and I am sure there is no doubt in the minds of the other Committee members--that the report will be discussed in that context.
        </para>
        <para>
         If we further look at the response by the Government, it is also reasonable to make a point in relation to the Government's statement on minority reports and the fact that there may be some evidence included in those reports which may in some way upset the confidentiality of material being given to the Committee by witnesses. The response goes on to state:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government wishes to make it clear that it supports--
        </para>
        <para>
         which is the operative word--
        </para>
        <para>
         the right of members of committees to add protesting or dissenting views to committee reports. Indeed, standing order 343 of the House permits this. The Government cannot, however, approve of a procedure under which a dissenting report, without the authority of the Committee, discloses in camera evidence--as occurred in the present case.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a reasonable judgment of what did happen. Going on a bit further, the Government very clearly takes into consideration, particularly in the Senate, the report by the Procedure Committee which lays down a procedure that will allow the disclosure of evidence for the purpose of bringing down reports. I believe that the procedure laid down by the Procedure Committee very clearly protects the members of the Committee and it also provides an opportunity for people to put forward material that might be dealt with as confidential before the Committee. Let me remind the Senate of the points made by the Procedure Committee in its report of 2 May 1989:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure suggested certain guidelines be followed by Senators who wished to refer in a dissenting report to evidence taken in camera. It recommended inter alia:
        </para>
        <para>
         -  the Senator should advise the Committee of the evidence concerned and all reasonable efforts should be made by the Committee to reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for this purpose;
        </para>
        <para>
         I feel sure that no-one on the Committee would have any argument with that sort of resolution. The second recommendation:
        </para>
        <para>
         -  witnesses involved should, if practicable, be informed of the proposed disclosure and given reasonable opportunity to object;
        </para>
        <para>
         That is an in-built safeguard which means that people will be able to object, if there is some particular reason, and put their point forward to the Committee. The final recommendation reads:
        </para>
        <para>
         -  consideration should be given to disclosing the evidence in such a way as to conceal the identity of persons who gave or are referred to in evidence.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, I do not believe that any member of the Committee would have an argument with that. It is important to remember that the Committee has to take steps to protect people who give in camera evidence. If it did not, in the future the Committee would find that it would not receive the evidence it should receive because of a witness's fear that confidentiality would not be protected by the Committee and a witness would come to some harm by giving that sort of evidence to the Committee.
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe that the response by the Government has been worth while. It notes that the report was tabled in the Senate on 17 October 1990 and in the House of Representatives on 18 October 1990, so a fairly long period elapsed before the final response came from the Government. Taking all that into consideration and the fact that the Government does recognise that the Committee will look at the report when it comes to its evaluation of the operation of the National Crime Authority, the response is worth while.

There is no doubt in my mind that the response is entirely appropriate to the report tabled in the House of Representatives by the honourable member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay. Again, the response is entirely appropriate to the minority or qualifying statement tabled in the Senate by Senator Vanstone. Could I say that the Opposition was profoundly embarrassed by some of the material which was tabled in the Senate that night by Senator Vanstone in that qualifying statement. The release of in camera evidence should not have occurred, as I think is now recognised right around the chamber.

         But more importantly this is the echo of a forgotten war. A great deal has happened within the National Crime Authority since the time of Operation Ark and indeed since the time that this report was tabled in the Parliament. Could I say that, under the chairmanship of Justice John Phillips, the National Crime Authority has a new sense of vigour, purpose, direction and energy. In that respect, the evaluation which the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has undertaken and its recommendations are going to be of far greater significance and consequence than anything which can ever be said about Operation Ark or the assessments made of that particular matter.

         The Committee in its evaluation is looking to the future and judging the capacity of the NCA in its present configuration, its present policies and its present personnel. I note the presence in the chamber of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate, and I am sure that he would concur with these observations. It is now very clear that Justice Phillips and the NCA have managed to work within a framework in which the intergovernmental committee--the IGC--is pleased to work closely and effectively with the NCA. The NCA is now in the circumstance where the relationship with the parliamentary Committee has probably never been better regarding exchanges, mutual confidence and mutual support. That is not to say that the parliamentary Committee is not prepared to be critical, is not prepared to make a critical evaluation, and to make that opinion known; far from it.
        </para>
        <para>
         In terms of the public and private briefings which Justice Phillips and his colleagues have given to the Joint Parliamentary Committee, there is no doubt that there is now in existence the basis for a first class relationship between the Parliament and the National Crime Authority. That, of course, was not always the case. The effectiveness of the NCA will be subject to new criteria, to new methods of evaluation. Already we can see in the level of innovation which Justice Phillips and his team have brought to the NCA how much progress has been made.

         Recently I was privileged to be in Melbourne for a demonstration of the electronic courtroom, which was organised by the NCA and a number of international law enforcement agencies and personnel. It showed the manner in which very complex fraud cases are dealt with in the courtroom of the 1990s. The demonstration was very effective and very enlightening. The prosecution presents to jurors in a manner that is readily comprehended and readily absorbed very complicated detail regarding the intricate dealings--mostly international dealings--of companies against whom fraud is alleged. This is communicated through slides, video and the like. The prosecution presented this very effectively through the forum organised by the NCA.
        </para>
        <para>
         That kind of innovation would not have occurred in previous times. The NCA had different objectives. But, I believe it is correct to say, the IGC has now endorsed the Future Directions policy. It has certainly met with the approval of the Joint Parliamentary Committee both informally and formally. The Future Directions policy has laid down clear guidelines and a clear set of criteria by which the NCA may be judged fairly and, in my view, well.

         There is no doubt in my mind that the rights of members of parliament, in circumstances where material is presented to them, are very real. They have responsibilities, but they also have obligations. There are great dangers if in camera evidence is presented to the Parliament without the procedures as laid down in the Government response, which stem from the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure of 2 May 1989, having been observed. Senator Jones went through those in detail. I will not cover the ground again. There are very real dangers, not only in an immediate sense but also in a longer term sense, if in camera evidence is presented without those relatively simple and fair procedures having been observed by all concerned. It is not only the reputation of individual members of parliament that is involved; it is the reputation of the Parliament's committee system entirely. Heaven alone knows that we do not want the Australian Senate to be placed in a circumstance such as the United States Senate currently finds itself in. I will say no more on that. That is not a path down which we ought to go.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Australian people are entitled to have confidence in our committee procedures and processes. They are intrinsic to the successful working of parliamentary democracy. But I stress again that overriding all concerns has to be a pre-eminent preoccupation with the safety of witnesses, particularly those that come before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the NCA.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is not a committee like any other. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, it deals with very sensitive material. There has to be respect for that material. There has to be care exercised in the manner in which that material is treated. In terms of the qualifying statement, care was not exercised. I said that at the time and I say it again now.
        </para>
        <para>
         I turn again to the future of the NCA, to the Future Directions policy on which it now works and bases its activities and to the support that it has across the board in terms of the IGC. Governments of all persuasions have endorsed its objectives as set down under Justice Phillips's stewardship. The Joint Parliamentary Committee has a first-class working relationship with the NCA now.

         Operation Ark now verges on ancient history. We are dealing with matters which are years old and which do not have great consequence for the future of the NCA.

         It concerns me quite a deal that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation in particular seems to be at odds with the industry more now than it has been probably since its formation. I believe that the industry has great expectations which, for one reason or another, may not be being fulfilled at present.
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe that the Corporation itself is doing a very good job. It has not increased, for instance, the per capita consumption of beef, but I do not think we can really blame that on the Corporation. But the presentation is getting better and better. The education in the industry is improving all the time. The computer-aided livestock marketing arrangement, for instance, is gaining strength. If it has been slow off the mark, it has been because of the attitudes of growers and producers far more than anything that the Corporation itself has done.
        </para>
        <para>
         We now find, for instance, that we have a very wide-ranging drought through the northern part of Australia which, again, is going to have considerable effect. There has been a lot of work done on pasture productivity. The improvement of pasture and forage generally for livestock makes a tremendous difference to the quantity and the quality of the meat. The genetic breeding program has come a long way. The market is price-sensitive, and we must realise that. If the growers want to get more for their meat--and I think they are entitled to that--they have to realise that the volume of their sales may well decline to some extent.
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe that the Meat Research Corporation has done very well. Everybody in the industry should give it great credit for what it has done in a very wide range of fields. While I have the opportunity, it would be appropriate that I also mention the possibility--and I hope the probability--of the establishment of a national research facility for intensive beef production, meat science and processing. This comes under the Cooperative Research Centre program that we currently have.
        </para>
        <para>
         In the second lot of propositions under discussion at the moment, I certainly have a lot of support for the producing of an intensive feeding facility in conjunction with the New England University for doing research into feedlotting, electronic intake measuring equipment, cattle metabolism units, food technology plant and so on. I believe it would assist the cattle producers, feed producers, manufacturers, feedlot operators, meat processors, exporters, meat consumers, national export revenue and industry employees. It would be a great unit for increasing the value of the product that we are selling. It would do a lot for the whole of the industry Australia-wide. The work it is doing is appropriate for use in every State. I believe that it is an operation that can only do good for the whole of the meat industry of Australia. I trust that its application, when it goes forward, will be put forward in such a way as to get the full support of the Government and the determining committee that is responsible for this work.

          —-The most significant achievement of the Meat Research Corporation in the past year has been its change of name from a somewhat clunky and verbose AMLR&amp; Corporation to the much slicker and trimmer Meat Research Corporation. If the AMLC is the vehicle by which the meat industry is to become a world leader, the Meat Research Corporation is the wheels on that particular vehicle.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         In his report, the Chairman says that the Corporation has spent the past year organising itself for the next five years. I hope that means that we can look forward to some dynamic research and development which will have a practical application for Australian meat producers. Increased beef levies will provide an additional $9m this financial year, making an anticipated levy income total of $23m. I note in regard to the Corporation's objectives that the beef conversion cost reduction has not yet been achieved; the disease control improvements have been partly achieved; in animal genetic improvements, the lamb plan has been achieved; meat marketing improvement has been partly achieved; and the developing resources objective has been partly achieved. A lot of work is still to be done on the objectives which have not been achieved.
        </para>
        <para>
         Achievements in the past year have included developmental work on Fututech, which is a new retailing system for meat, and improvements in disease control, notably blue tongue research. I also note that the Corporation is doing a good deal with projects involving feedlots. Senator Archer has already mentioned what is happening at the UNE in Armidale. I trust and hope that he and I will be able to visit there in the near future and see what is happening. Given that the Australian feedlot capacity is expected to double in the next five years, it is important that research into such things as feed, sire selection, appropriate beef breeds for various markets and environmental aspects of feedlots continues and is really investigated.
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe greater attention will need to be paid to this last aspect. Work done in the United States of America is providing useful data for Australian feedlots. Last year I visited the Montfort feedlot in Denver, Colorado. It was most interesting to see what was happening there. Their laboratories are really working on research, and I think it is of concern to the Australian beef industry that when the Americans get longer shelf life for their chilled beef they could be a real threat to some of our markets in the eastern areas.
        </para>
        <para>
         As with the AMLC, much of what is hoped to be achieved this financial year will be curtailed by the twin offsets of drought and economic recession. I think we must take note of that because I think it will affect some of the levies collected from the beef industry. However, I have great faith in the long term viability of the Australian beef industry, and the Australian meat industry generally. Just as we will all look to the AMLC to provide the marketing so too will we need to rely, and indeed insist, upon superior research from the Meat Research Corporation to help Australia reach that premier position. I notice also that the Corporation is looking at animal stress reduction in the live sheep trade, which I think is absolutely essential.
        </para>
        <para>
         One other part of the report mentions more efficient meat inspection. Let us hope we can have more efficient meat inspection that does not cost as much as it does at the moment because of inefficiency. I think something like 60 inspectors are resident in towns around Australia which do not even have abattoirs. Finally, I turn to the implementation of the new slaughtering system. The report states:
        </para>
        <para>
         Once implemented, the technology will be the first real breakthrough for the processing industry world-wide in the beef slaughtering area.
        </para>

         I commend the new Meat Research Corporation for its endeavours in that area.

          —-I wish to comment on the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation report and take note of the fact that, whilst we are critical of the United States, particularly in regard to wheat, our beef exporters shifted 367,000 tonnes to North America last year. This was an increase of some 10 per cent, and represents 50 per cent of Australia's total beef exports. When we are being critical of the American Government about the way we have been treated with regard to our wheat, we should remember how well we have been treated with regard to our beef.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         There is a very interesting part in this report about transport. The Corporation states that it:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . maintained an active role assisting exporters in negotiations with shipping conferences in promoting waterfront reform.
        </para>
        <para>
         The report states that a key element in that was achieving long term reductions in freight charges. Unfortunately Senator Collins is not here to hear this, and he would probably disagree with it anyway, but it goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para>
         Unfortunately, the extent and pace of the waterfront reform in Australia has been below the standards set by our international competitors. Some shedding of waterfront labour is due to occur in Australia--
        </para>
        <para>
         and I believe some has occurred--
        </para>
        <para>
         but stevedoring firms have signalled that, because of higher wage and labour on-costs, no reductions in waterfront charges are likely to result.
        </para>
        <para>
         The report compares that with the tremendous result in New Zealand. Our competitors overseas have reduced their waterfront charges by up to 50 per cent. For example, rates from New Zealand to North America have dropped by about 40 per cent. At this point in time, I do not believe we can claim anywhere near that figure. I hope by this time next year, with the help of Senator Collins' expertise which he keeps telling us about, perhaps we will be able to claim the same thing.
        </para>
        <para>
         A fair amount of the first part of the Meat Research Corporation annual report, to which Senator Brownhill referred, is about its principal objectives. One of those objectives is to automate slaughtering. It goes on to tell us about Fututech and what it is trying to do to reduce the cost of slaughtering animals. We can understand why it is trying to do that when we see what has happened in Victoria, where the well-publicised Mr Wally Curran is calling for the Government to have a job program. The Meat Research Corporation has been spending a vast amount of money to try to automate the slaughtering of sheep and cattle because of the costs to the industry. Mr Curran should have kept some of his abattoirs in Victoria open. I do not know how many have closed. Perhaps Senator Lewis can tell me. Quite a few have been closed for up to nine months. On the other hand, we hear Mr Curran talking about creating jobs. If he could get his meatworkers to go back to work that would reduce the number of unemployed.
        </para>
        <para>
         Another important aspect in the Meat Research Corporation annual report is tucked away on page 33. Some of this research may seem insignificant, but it involves a sensory analysis for products targeting Japan. I managed to see this on television one night. People are actually trying to grow and prepare beef that appeals to the sensory tastes of the Japanese. That is rather innovative but, given the fact that Japan takes so much of our product, I think it is an essential program and should be supported.
        </para>
        <para>
         I notice that the sheepskin industry program is still going ahead, as is the project looking at lean red meat in human nutrition. That is most important these days. The Deakin University has been doing a lot more work trying to process lean red meat and reduce the so-called bad cholesterol that most of us in this place would have heard about from time to time.
        </para>
        <para>
         Another matter, which I think was touched on earlier, concerns the work being done on myxomatosis. Given the drought situation and the competition that feral animals provide for our livestock industry, any work that can be done to reduce the number of feral animals is also of great importance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         In the very few minutes available to me I shall do my best to deal with a very difficult and lengthy subject. Professor Robert Baxt, formerly Professor of Law and Dean of the Faculty of Law at Monash University, began a three-year term as Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission on 7 April 1988. That term expired on 30 June 1991. In other words, this report covers the last 12 months of the Trade Practices Commission's activities under the chairmanship of Professor Robert Baxt.

         After his retirement Professor Baxt prepared a chapter for inclusion in the report. He states in the chapter:

         I have been influenced to write this partly because of the precedent set by the first Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Mr Ron Bannerman.

         Ron Bannerman's 17 years as Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, or Commissioner of Restrictive Trade Practices, were outstanding years in setting up the framework of administration of this important piece of legislation. His style of administration was very different to that of my predecessor, Bob McComas who brought considerable strength from his background as a leading commercial lawyer to the administration of the Act. Whilst my style has been quite different again from that of Bob McComas, I have benefited enormously from the framework which he and Ron Bannerman have developed and strengthened.

         It has been a great privilege to serve as the Chairman of this important body. In leaving it in reasonably good shape (although inadequately resourced) I wish it and the Government well for its continued success as the champion and watchdog of Australian competition and consumer protection law. I just hope that some at least of the initiatives which have been developed during my term will be advanced further and strengthened wherever possible.

        </para>
        <para>
         In this report I highlight some of the features of the three and a quarter years during which I chaired this Commission. I will also be pointing to the future in relation not only to the administration of this law but how Governments, Federal, State, and Territory might better ensure that the citizens of Australia are better protected (where that protection is necessary), from the excesses that may occur if anti competitive and unfair practices are allowed to go unchecked, especially in an environment of deregulation.
        </para>
        <para>
         The business environment of the 1980s, especially the latter part of the 1980s, have been influenced by two very significant developments inter alia. In the first place we have seen the remarkable feature of a Labor Government taking up the mantle and becoming in fact the champion of micro economic reform and deregulation. Many within the Labor Government, as well as outside it, were surprised and perhaps disappointed that such a vigorous program of deregulation has been championed by a political party which may well have been seen in the past as being less inclined to allow the market to be the `regulator' of the business environment. Some of the implications of this development for competition policy and law are considered in this chapter.
        </para>
        <para>
         The second major feature has been the evolvement of a political and business environment in which greed has been seen as a key feature. A cry of the late 1980s and early 1990s, both in the political and business environment, has been the need to make Australian businesses and those who run and advise Australian businesses more accountable for some of the excesses that have occurred in the marketplace during the 1980s. Whilst these cries have been directed primarily at excesses which are outside the area of Trade Practices Law (at least that would be the perception from the public's viewpoint), it is clear as a result of a number of cases that the Trade Practices Commission has run during this period, that many excesses have also occurred in the area of competition and consumer protection law. Indeed, our major court successes have been against some of the most reputable companies in the land rather than the entrepreneurial ones.

         Because Trade Practices law relies on civil remedies and penalties (with some criminal type penalties in the area of Consumer Protection), there may have been a different emphasis placed by the business community on the need for businesses and persons involved in managing these businesses to comply with the legislation. The following passage from the judgment of French J. in the case of TPC v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 epitomises some of the frustrations that confront regulators such as the Trade Practices Commission in dealing with major companies in this country and their reaction to the need to comply with Trade Practices law.
        </para>
        <para>
         Recognising some of the difficulties faced by the management of the company when it found itself facing competition in an area where previously non existed, the judge added these chilling comments:
        </para>
        <para>
         "There was little convincing evidence of a corporate culture seriously committed to the need to comply with the requirements of the Act. The compliance program as indicated by the evidence appeared desultory and in need of reinforcement. No indication of any corrective measures or revitalisation of that program was offered. The corporate culture was, I think, reflected in CSR's dealings with the Commission and the conduct of this litigation. It is to its credit that it has withdrawn its defences and submitted to injunctions restraining further contravention. However that withdrawal and submission came nearly two years after proceedings were instituted and followed a period of protracted stonewalling in CSR's dealings with the Commission. I have no doubt that the preparation of the case by the Commission has consumed an enormous amount of time and financial resources. CSR's conduct in its dealings with the Commission and in relation to these proceedings, when viewed in the light of the admissions it now makes, is an aggravating factor." ((1991) ATPR at pp 52-155-52, 156)
        </para>
        <para>
         I include these comments early in this overview chapter because it is my view that there has been a commonly held belief abroad in the business and general community that perhaps Trade Practices law is `second class' economic law that needs only a modicum of attention from sectors of the business community. Low penalties (which are discussed briefly below) play a significant part in this scenario. The resources that have been provided to the agency which administers the law, and the Government departments which are responsible for developing policy in relation to this area of the law have not received high priority--this is not seen as a vote winner. If we are to have a successful implementation of competition policy in this country, which is the matter I want to turn to shortly in this review, then that attitude must change and change very quickly.
        </para>
        <para>
         Before turning to the question of the development of a competition policy and the need for resources to ensure that such a development occurs, let me say that during my term as Chairman the Commission has been generally impressed by the changing attitude of many corporations to their obligations under the law. The successes of the Commission in a number of cases in 1990, such as TPC v Sony (Australia) Pty Ltd (1990) ATPR 41-053 and TPC v Carlton United Breweries Ltd and Ors (1990) ATPR 41-037, the CSR case referred to earlier has led to the creation of many more compliance programs than has previously been the case. One such program which was developed during 1991 and which I feel particularly proud of is the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Commission joint program launched by the Attorney General Mr Michael Duffy on 18 March 1991. That program has been `sold' to a large number of companies and one suspects that it will be the forerunner of many other similar programs to be adopted by corporations throughout the land. Compliance is important and will be a very significant factor in persuading the courts to provide lower penalties.

         Resources for the Commission and the development of competition policy
        </para>
        <para>
         When I became Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission the thing that struck me most after two or three weeks was the fact that the Commission's budget had not been increased in line with the inflationary and other indexes against which one measured the Commission's performance. It had certainly not reflected the increase of its responsibilities. I and my colleagues on the Trade Practices Commission conducted a vigorous campaign to increase the budget of the Commission in 1988. This received considerable support not only from members of all political parties, but from the community at large. Interested commentators almost without exception strongly supported this push. The increase in our workloads during that year, together with new work that was being generated as a result of micro economic reform, led to the Government giving the Commission a useful increase in its resource base during 1989. Recognition was also given to the increased workload of the Commission in the area of mergers and other anti-competitive practices. But it has been disappointing to me that the Government has not appreciated in any constructive way that micro economic reform has and will impact on the work of the Commission. The call by the Prime Minister and other Ministers for competition to be at the core of our revitalised and deregulated services industries, means the Commission needs a greater resource base; for as Australian governments remove the protection previously provided by the regulatory agencies, the framework being dismantled, relying on competition to deliver the bene-fits of a market approach, the governments must recognise that it is the Commission which will have to ensure that the competitive process works.
        </para>
        <para>
         The business and economic environment in which the Commission has to carry out its work as this policy is enhanced have been well encapsulated by the Prime Minister in his 12 March 1991 statement in delivering his speech "Building a competitive Australia". Let me repeat these words:
        </para>
        <para>
         "We will press ahead with further reform, to increase competition and efficiency within Australia. For the consumer, competition means lower prices and a broader range of better quality goods and services; for producers it provides the spur to better performance--at home and abroad. We want to see the whole domestic economy opened up to this kind of positive structural change. . . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         The Trade Practices Act is our principal legislative weapon to ensure that consumers get the best deal from competition. But there are many areas of the Australian economy today that are immune from that Act; some Commonwealth enterprises, State public sector businesses, and significant areas of the private sector, including the professions.
        </para>
        <para>
         This patchwork coverage reflects historical and constitutional factors, not economic efficiency; it is another important instance of the way we operate as six economies rather than one.
        </para>
        <para>
         The benefits for the consumer of expanding the scope of the Trade Practices Act could be immense:  potentially lower professional fees, cheaper road and rail fares, cheaper electricity."
        </para>
        <para>
         The scenario which the Prime Minister was describing as one that he would like to see further develop was already partly in place at that time. There had been significant micro economic reform and deregulation in the telecommunications area, banking and finance, the civil aviation area, the waterfront and in the rural sector. The Commission was given modest increases in its resource vote in relation to the waterfront and in general terms but not in the other areas. Indeed the increase was and remains insufficient if the Commission is to undertake the type of work that it adopted during my three and a quarter years and if it is to provide the kind of general overseeing role which the Prime Minister clearly identifies as essential in the quotation set out above.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Commission can take one of two roles, it seems to me, in dealing with rapid change that is occurring in our economic environment. It can sit back and await the occurrence of breaches of the law and then react to those breaches as a policeman might. It can be a very strict enforcer of the law. Or it can take a proactive approach and seek to educate the community; it can seek to ensure that there is a better understanding of the competitive environment--this will not only reduce the overall litigation work of the Commission, in the short and long term, but it will also ensure that the Government's wishes in making Australia a more competitive economy come to fruition more quickly.
        </para>
        <para>
         The concept of a competitive Australia as enunciated by Prime Minister Hawke on 12 March 1991 built on a series of earlier statements made by him and other Ministers about the importance of competition in Australian industry. Yet, regrettably, in my view, there had been little appreciation by Government Ministers about how competition can really be made to work in the absence of an effective policeman or regulator and in the absence of appropriate law. In the area of telecommunications the Government had chosen to give Austel very considerable regulatory powers to ensure that there was no misuse of market power and other unfair practices (inter alia). It chose not to subject the bulk of this industry to the operation of trade practices law. In other areas of micro economic reform (e.g. civil domestic aviation and the financial sectors for example) the Trade Practices Commission using the Trade Practices Act is expected to be the most appropriate way to ensure that the wishes of the Government are fulfilled. If the Commission is to undertake these tasks in an appropriate fashion it must be provided with a better resource base. When deregulation occurs the `protection' that has previously been afforded the consumer through a series of regulations and legislation administered by specific bodies, is generally left to the operation of the market. The Commission, as the body responsible for the administration of the Trade Practices Act, is the only body most consumers can turn to to ensure that they receive the appropriate protection in that environment if there are unfair practices or anti-competitive behaviour or if the market does not work. One can contrast the type of approach the Government has adopted towards the Trade Practices Commission with its very generous funding of both Austel and the Australian Securities Commission. In my view the Commission should be treated no differently to those bodies, although allowance would clearly have to be made for the fact that it had been in existence for some time.
        </para>
        <para>
         But the question of resources is not simply one of the resources to be voted to the Trade Practices Commission. They are by all accounts inadequate if it is to fulfil its obligations of being the guardian of competition and the consumer.

         Competition Policy and Micro Economic Reform--Some Problems
        </para>
        <para>
         The question of resources also relates to the kind of resources the Government is prepared to provide generally to an examination of the importance of competition policy, and how that policy links in to the development of its micro-economic reform agenda. We have not seen, with respect, the Government tackle the issue of the effectiveness of competition policy and law (in the context of the Trade Practices Act) when it has generally dealt with micro economic reform. This was dealt with only partially and unsatisfactorily by the Government when it looked at the question of Telecommunications. It did not allow an open debate on this issue, the whole question being debated in the press through leaked Cabinet documents and submissions.
        </para>
        <para>
         Issues of competition policy were poorly handled by the Government when it announced airline deregulation in 1987. The granting of 30 year leases to the two airlines in the hope that the Trade Practices Act would provide adequate protection to new players has been roundly criticised by all and sundry. Nor has the issue been dealt with except in very vague and general terms in relation to the waterfront--although the government is to be congratulated for ensuring that specific funds were voted to the Commission to undertake this work.
        </para>
        <para>
         Another example of where competition policy has not been thought through is in the area of bank mergers and "alliances". Whilst the banks are subject to the merger provisions of the Trade Practices Act, they are also subject to the fiat of the Treasurer. In disallowing the ANZ/National Mutual merger the Treasurer of the day, Paul Keating, announced that the merger would not proceed because it was not in the national interest, and because it would lead to a substantial lessening of competition. The test under the Trade Practices Act is dominance, not a substantial lessening of competition. Recently the new Treasurer, Mr Kerin, recognised that this was an issue that needed to be addressed and addressed very quickly in giving his "blessing" to the Westpac-AMP alliance.
        </para>
        <para>
         Perhaps the most graphic illustration of the lack of a coherent policy on competition law has been the rather strange attitude of the government towards the media. The government established cross media rules which have in my view no cohesion in the "regulation" of mergers or other anti competitive arrangements. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is responsible for television and radio with very restricted powers on dealing with acquisitions, the Trade Practices Act being the relevant legislation to deal with print mergers. The Trade Practices Act is the relevant legislation when other anti competitive arrangements involving all media are involved as was shown to be the case in September 1990 when there were concerns about plans to restructure the Channel 10 network. The announced need for retrospective legislation to deal with issues of control and influence in the media shows a lack of clear policy on the part of the government in its evaluation of this highly sensitive industry. The attitude of "lets fix it up" afterwards is both irresponsible and evidence of a lack of will to tackle this vital area responsibly. Of course the overriding power of the Treasurer to block foreign investment in this and other industry is another issue which is in need of urgent review.
        </para>
        <para>
         The development of a policy on competition policy is vital as the exciting initiatives taken by the Prime Minister on our federal structure opens up the possibility of the Trade Practices Act becoming far more relevant than it has ever been. Will it be effective in being translated into these virgin areas or do we need a new Act to cope with new problems such as the "regulation" of natural monopolies"?  These are but some of the questions which need to be addressed.
        </para>
        <para>
         The assertion by the government that it was in command of competition policy and the legislation which embodies this policy has not been evidenced by its attention to the needs of the Trade Practices Commission. Despite the fact that I advised the then Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen in August 1988 that we would need a new Deputy Chairman from early 1989 (Bill Coad was seeking and did obtain another appointment in the Attorney-General's portfolio by December 1988), the current Deputy Chairman Brian Johns was not on deck until September 1989. For eight months, during which the work load of the Commission increased in intensity and importance, Allan Asher and I were left to run the Commission when Brian Johns was ready and waiting to join it. I had advised the Department that he was the man for the job, in February 1989. A government committed to this area would have answered this plea more urgently.
        </para>
        <para>
         When my successor Allan Fels was appointed (and it was clear he would be my successor as early as the beginning of June 1991) there was apparently no urgency seen in ensuring that he would be able to become a full time chairman (as is required by the Act) as he was left as Chairperson of the Prices Surveillance Authority for the whole of July and early August (at least). Again it is important to impress the  need for a full time commitment to the work of the Commission.
        </para>
        <para>
         Despite the fact that I advised the Attorney-General and the Department as early as July 1990 about the need for lawyers to be appointed as Associate Commissioners, and gave him and the Department the names of a number of people who could be approached to fill this important role, as at the time of writing no lawyers have been appointed 14 months after. I can think of fewer better examples of a lack of commitment to this area than the failure on the part of the government to ensure that the Commission is able to call on a full complement of willing and able commissioners and associated commissioners. The Attorney-General and the Department must give more active and urgent attention to these needs.
        </para>
        <para>
         At present competition law is administered by the Attorney-General's Department. Paul Keating, when Treasurer, had suggested (in late 1990) that a ministry of Competition Policy or similar portfolio might be created to oversee the various approaches that were being taken to the development of competition policy. I believe that the development of a specialist ministry or position is the right way to go. I am not sure whether I would agree with the establishment of a Competition Ministry as such, but I believe that by allowing trade practices and competition policies to be relegated to the position it previously occupies--a very minor part of the Attorney-General's portfolio, the Government is making a serious error of judgement. The very small number of people in Attorney-General's Department who are responsible for this area work extremely hard at trying to keep abreast of the important developments. But frankly, just as I think that our courts are inadequately resourced to deal with the handling of competition cases and issues, so I believe the Attorney-General's Department and the office of the Minister, (and indeed the Trade Practices Commission itself), are inadequately resourced to deal with this increasingly important area of government.
        </para>
        <para>
         Australia needs to employ either in full time positions or on contract more people with appropriate economic and business training to deal with this area of work. More importantly there has to be a willingness and ability to look at competition policy in the context of its linkage to the other aspects of Government policy to ensure they will achieve appropriate results. The Attorney-General's Department has, in my respectful view, been far too reactive to Government initiatives; and often the reaction is too slow, and regrettably unimaginative. The Attorney-General, Michael Duffy, who has been a very progressive and active Minister in a number of other areas, needs the time to devote to developing his and the Government's thinking in this area--he should be allowed to take a leadership role in this vital area. Regrettably the work load that is imposed on him (and other Government Ministers) is too great to enable more than passing attention to be given to this important area. The splitting of competition policy and consumer protection policy also reflects poorly in my view, on the importance of these two areas to be seen as flip sides of the same coin.
        </para>
        <para>
         Perhaps a better solution would be to move this area of economic law to a new economics based Ministry such as Business and Consumer Affairs (such a Ministry was very effectively administered with the help of people like Tony Hartnell in this late 1970s). Whatever solution is chosen, and this is of equal importance, the Government should involve the Trade Practices Commission at the policy development stages as well as actively canvassing community views early in developing policy.
        </para>
        <para>
         The courts are also inadequately resourced--there are not enough Federal judges, they are grossly under-paid in my view, and they do not have the back up resources that are necessary to enable them to deal with these matters effectively. Trade practices and competition law issues throw up difficult economic questions that need to be addressed by courts which have the necessary economic and other background to handle them. Whilst there are exceptions to this general proposition I suspect that many of our judges believe themselves not to be adequately trained in economics to handle this area. The Griffiths Committee in its report "Inquiry into mergers, takeovers and monopolies" delivered in May 1989 recommended a greater use of the specialist Trade Practices Tribunal to deal with such issues. There is no reason why judges, politicians, regulators and professionals should not receive appropriate training in economics and law to make them more able to deal with this area. There is no shame in admitting that we need extra education, and resources, to enable us to handle these matters adequately and in a way that will achieve appropriate results. In the USA (and Canada) such training is a feature of their judicial and professional make-up for some years.
        </para>
        <para>
         Furthermore even if Government voted the resources to the Commission, to the courts and to the bureaucracy, it needs to recognise the need for flexibility to allow the Government sector to compete effectively with the private sector and hiring specialists to deal with the problem areas. It is in litigation that the Commission suffered most. It was subject to out-dated rules which say that the TPC (and other regulatory agencies are in the same boat) cannot pay senior counsel or other experts more than $2,500 a day to act for us. This penalises the Commission (and thus the community) in competing against our opponents. Whilst there are many counsel and experts in our capital cities who are prepared to undertake work for the Commission at these very much below market value fees, the Commission had been finding it increasingly more difficult to persuade these persons to take on all our cases or to act as experts. This is especially so where the cases are long and they are asked to sacrifice quite significant sums of money (in many cases counsel are being paid less than half the market rate) in competing against the lawyers representing the largest corporations in the land. If the Commonwealth wants effective regulation of business practices whether they be in trade practices, corporate law, or other areas where they are fighting companies which are very large, very powerful and very rich, then it is going to have to think very differently about the resources that it makes available to the regulatory bodies to ensure they can have the lawyers and other experts of their choice in doing battle.
        </para>
        <para>
         This general direction on policy and resources is most regrettable. It means competition policy and the law upon which it is built and which is so much part of the Prime Minister's policy in this area is being allowed to "sail" along without a rudder--indeed some have suggested that it suits the government to give it this low profile. Whilst I am not as cynical I regret that during my three and a quarter years I was often disappointed at the very low priority given to this area of government responsibility.

         The Administration of the Law
        </para>
        <para>
         There have been many significant developments and events which deserve some highlighting in an overview chapter of this kind. These successes and developments reflect not only on my ability to use the resources available to me to achieve a successful administration of the Act, but more importantly reflects on the achievement of the staff of the Commission and the trade practices cell of the Australian Government Solicitor's office attached to the Commission. Again I wish to thank all my colleagues at the Commission, the Department and the Ministry during the three and a quarter years.

        <para>
         Mergers
        </para>
        <para>
         I was concerned at the apparent inability or unwillingness of the Commission to tackle some of the mergers which on the surface at least, seemed prime candidates for the authorisation route or court challenge. Bill Coad, Deputy Chairman of the Commission at the time, was concerned that the practice of the Commission in entering into private arrangements with companies which were engaged in takeover activity, may have gone too far. The May 1988 Objectives and Priorities paper announced a new approach to the consideration of mergers and as a direct result we have seen a number of successful court action and authorisation. Elsewhere in the pages of this report readers will find a discussion of the Full Federal Court's decision in Arnotts, and the decision of Burchett J. in ACI-Smorgons. Australia Meat Holdings and the Daily News cases have been discussed in earlier annual reports. The successful authorisation decisions in Fletcher Challenge joint venture (discussed in 1988-1989 report have now been complemented by the decision of the Commission in ACI-Smorgons which is discussed in Chapter . . . of this Report.
        </para>
        <para>
         Whilst there remains a reluctance on the part of some members of the business community to use the authorisation process, I believe that the speed and flexibility of the process as illustrated by the ACI-Smorgons matter should encourage greater use of this process. If the suggestion by Douglas Williamson QC to allow authorisations to be dealt with directly by the Trade Practices Tribunal (with the Commission acting as amicus curiae) is taken on board this will encourage even greater use of this procedure. But time constraints will need to be imposed on the Tribunal if we are not to destroy the utility of the authorisation process.
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not favour a return to the substantially lessening of competition test as I believe the dominance test is viable. But it is necessary in my view to reintroduce a limited form of pre-notification and sensitive industries deserve a different treatment. But before turning to this question I want to say a little more about the court processes.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Commission has been reluctant to go to the courts because the cases take a long time, cost a great deal, and do not necessarily result in the success that the Commission believes should come its way. The Australia Meat Holdings case is a classic example of extraordinary delays in reaching a final result. I do not wish to comment on why these delays have occurred. Certainly Mr Justice Wilcox, the judge who heard the original application by the Commission to enjoin the merger, as well as being the judge deciding the final case, expressed some concern at the length of time for the divestiture to be effected. He suggested that he should perhaps have granted an injunction when it was sought initially, rather than allow the merger to take place and then let the matter proceed to divestiture had he known that the matter was going to take so long.
        </para>
        <para>
         The resources of the courts are probably inadequate to deal with the type of economic legislation that we have to administer under the Trade Practices Act. The Commission has been critical of the fact that the courts have had some difficulty in coming to grips with the interpretation of the economically oriented provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Certainly the court cases that the Commission has run have been too slow. At times the Commission has been dissatisfied with the procedures that are in place to achieve a speedy result in the context of a practice or arrangement that needs to be evaluated. The Arnotts/Nabisco case took over nine months--surely this was too long for any merger matter to be evaluated in the courts. The Australia Meat Holdings case, although it took a relatively short period of time in the hearing phase--three months from the start of the case to the decision--then took a further two years to be finally resolved through the divestiture of the acquisition held to breach the Act.
        </para>
        <para>
         With the Australia Meat Holdings case one can perhaps level blame for the delays on both the TPC's quite unreasonable patience, and what I would regard as delaying tactics by the defendants. In Arnotts, the tactics used by the defendant's counsel were not always vigorously opposed or adequately countered by the TPC's own counsel; certainly the trial court was not strict enough in conducting the case. The Full Court's criticism of the trial is quite appropriate in my view:
        </para>
        <para>
         "We recognise the burden of presenting a complex case such as this. The parties were represented at the trial by experienced counsel. None the less, we regard the situation which we have described as unacceptable. Neither the Court nor the litigants should have to contend with the constraints imposed by unnecessarily wide confidentiality orders. Neither should they be burdened with the consequences of a mountain of seemingly unnecessary  evidence. We have no doubt that, with even reasonable attention on both sides to the relevance and utility of the questions being asked and the documents being tendered, the trial could have been completed in much less time than it actually took and, consequentially, with much less cost to the parties.
        </para>
        <para>
         There appears to be an assumption abroad today about commercial litigation: that, when big issues are at stake, there must inevitably be a long complicated hearing. This assumption must be discarded. No matter how much is at stake, in dollar terms, there is no justification of irrelevant or unuseful evidence. Moreover, it is in the interests of the parties to analyse properly the cases which they wish to make and to restrict themselves to helpful material;  and not only because of savings in costs. The devotion of excessive attention to peripheral matters, rather than the main issues, causes the parties to lose sight of the real issues and to devote insufficient attention to them. The result may be to leave the Court with insufficient or unsatisfactory material upon principal factual issues. The essence of counsel's function is the identification of, and concentration upon, the critical issues in the case." (1990 ATPR at 51,782.)
        </para>
        <para>
         The Nabisco business is now to be "divested". But the length of time which has passed since the "acquisition" by Arnotts means that Arnotts probably has achieved much of what it wanted to achieve by the acquisition. One wonders what is left of the Nabisco lines which can be usefully purchased and utilised by another firm as a competitive pressure to the efficient and dominant Arnotts machine.
        </para>
        <para>
         The dominance test may well prove to be highly embarrassing for the Government in some of the deregulated industries where, by virtue of the granting of significant power to incumbent players, a merger or takeover involving a third entrant or player could not be stopped. I refer in particular to the airline industry where, because of the significant power held by both Ansett and Australian, any attempt by either of those companies to acquire Compass (the only true entrant in the deregulated environment to date) or if the reverse were to occur as has recently been signalled (namely the acquisition of Australian by Compass), could probably not be stopped under the terms of s50 of the Act. Neither company by acquiring Compass' small but growing share of the Australian market would be said to have achieved dominance;  and similarly by virtue of the strength of the two major players, Compass' acquisition of Australian would also not breach the merger provisions.
        </para>
        <para>
         A different issue would, of course, arise if we were dealing with the telecommunications industry;  but had both Telecom and OTC been allowed to operate in the market, rather than creating the giant Megacom, then perhaps any takeover by either OTC or Telecom of a third player might not have resulted in dominance either.
        </para>
        <para>
         There could be similar problems facing Government if deregulation occurs in the energy sectors, and where some of our State Governments operate monopolies, e.g, transport etc.:  or where duopolies or oligopolies may exist and where a new player could be easily "knocked off" without breaching the dominance provisions of the Trade Practices Act.

         There is a growing concern that the absence of a pre-notification system (no mergers have to be advised to the Commission as a matter of course in contrast to the position in the United States, Canada, Europe and until recently New Zealand) we need a tougher test. This has also been helped by the vigorous debate about the media and the banking and financial sector (inter alia).
        </para>
        <para>
         Whilst I was Chairman the Commission had suggested to the Griffiths Committee, a suggestion it repeated elsewhere, that whilst the Commission would not formally welcome the return to the substantial lessening of competition test, it would support the reviewing of certain mergers in the sensitive industries through a formal process not dissimilar to the authorisation test. Under this proposal the Commission would have the onus (not the parties as is the current position in the authorisation area) to show that the merger should not proceed where a net public detriment would likely be produced by the merger--in other words despite some of the benefits that might be produced by the merger, the public would be worse off if the merger were allowed to go ahead. Clearly only large mergers would be pushed through this particular process--it would be an intolerable burden if the Commission had to deal with all of the mergers in the sensitive industries in that way.
        </para>
        <para>
         The industries that I would nominate as sensitive include the media (where a similar approach is adopted in the United Kingdom), the banking and financial sector (where the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, has recently indicated that the Government needs to reassess competition policy in the light of developments in that industry), probably the petroleum area (where there is concern that competition is not as effective as it might be), and possibly in the area of food. Other industries could be added to the list if the Government felt that the area was so sensitive as to warrant such a classification. I would suggest that the deregulated industries would be strong candidates for nomination in the sensitive areas category--telecommunications, television if pay TV is introduced, and perhaps the rural sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         Treasury already engages in some evaluation of mergers in the financial sector and in other areas where it has responsibility (in respect of foreign investment or otherwise). The problem with a Treasury evaluation is that it is not public. The authorisation process engaged in by the Trade Practices Commission is both public and subject to a tight time constraint (45 days) which requires the Commission to ensure a speedy resolution.

         Misuse of Market Power
        </para>
        <para>
         The less than satisfactory interpretation of s.46 by the Full Federal Court in Queensland Wire Pty Ltd v BHP Ltd ((1988) ATPR 40-841) led me to believe that it was essential for the Commission to seek the right to intervene in High Court appeal. Our "Claytons" intervention in that case is well recorded in the history of the law. The Background Paper produced by the Commission on the interpretation of s.46 has been a notable contribution to the business and legal communities. The Commission has also successfully litigated matters involving s.46. The landmark determinations on penalty in TPC v CUB &amp;Others ((1990) ATPR 41-037) and TPC v CSR Ltd ((1991) ATPR 41-076) have paved the way for a stronger compliance culture in Australia but one which is perhaps still in need of enhancing. Our (as yet undetermined) intervention in the Matilda Oil Case (O'Keefe Nominees Pty Ltd v BP Pty Ltd ((1990) ATPR 41-057) may signal some important developments for the future I have been disappointed at the lack of action on the part of government to respond to the unsatisfactory position faced by the TPC under S.163A where it seeks the right to intervene.
        </para>
        <para>
         As signalled in the Background Paper there are still major problems facing small business in relation to the operation of s.46. The matters cannot be addressed properly or appropriately by amending s.52A as had been suggested as an option by the Commission to the Small Business Inquiry (the Beddall Committee) a more fundamental problem faces that sector. Also there are issues which arise from de-regulation and the utility of s.46 to deal with these problems. Before I completed my term I forwarded to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Small Business a Commission Report on the possible extension of s.52A.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Lionel Bowen the then Attorney-General in introducing amendments of s.46 in 1986 (when the threshold for the section was lowered considerably) indicated that he believed that individuals should be the recipients of some protection as a result of the changed language. He noted:
        </para>
        <para>
         "The effective provision controlling misuse of market power is most important to ensure that small businesses are given a measure of protection from the predatory actions of powerful competitors. Unfortunately, s.46 as presently drafted has proved of quite limited effectiveness in achieving that result, principally because the section applies only to monopolists or those with overwhelming dominance. Even in those cases, it has been extremely difficult for a plaintiff to establish the requisite predatory purpose on the part of the defendant corporation." (Emphasis added)
        </para>
        <para>
         The Second Reading Speech (paragraph 49) after describing the various ways in which the conduct covered by s.46 may be "caught" states:
        </para>
        <para>
         "[The corporation's] market power gives it leverage which it is able to exploit and this power is deployed so as to `take advantage of' the relative weakness of other participants or potential participants in the market.
        </para>
        <para>
         These words at least indicate that the section is aimed at behaviour that might impact on individuals. However, paragraph 48 of the same document indicates that the draftsman is mainly concerned about the way in which competition may be impaired in the market for those are the words directly used.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is an inconsistency between providing protection for single competitors as against the competitive process. The latter phrase is at the heart of the High Court decision in the Queensland Wire case. This "tension" in the language needs to be addressed quickly by Parliament to ensure that the inconsistency that might be generated in interpreting the section is eradicated.
        </para>
        <para>
         Purpose is a difficult matter to prove (as noted by Lionel Bowen);  although s.46(7) was added to make the task for the Commission (and other persons) easier in establishing--purpose it will still be an extraordinarily difficult matter to establish. I return to this question later.
        </para>
        <para>
         Remedies and s.46
        </para>
        <para>
         It is in the context of the remedies that the section creates greatest problems in my view. There is an inadequate range of remedies available to the court in dealing with misuse of market power, especially if engaged in by monopolists. It is true that the section is not aimed at monopolists any longer (see the Second Reading Speech of Lionel Bowen in introducing the 1986 amendments). But what if the misuse of market power is by monopolists, or arises in a situation which can be described as a shared monopoly (where for example duopolists or oligopolists--and there are many of these in industries in Australia--choose to act together!)?  Whilst an injunction issued by the court may deal with the particular matter that led to the particular breach, it does not go to the heart of the matter. As has been noted by the leading American commentators on antitrust law Professors Areeda and Turner in their classic work Antitrust Law:
        </para>
        <para>
         "To the extent that society reprehends monopoly profit [and the misuse of monopoly power] it should attack the existence of the power rather than its exercise--as we have recommended for persistent monopoly."  (Areeda and Turner, Antitrust Law, para 710.)
        </para>
        <para>
         That particular approach is one that is consistent with the language of the US courts, commencing with the classic decision in the Standard Oil case (Standard Oil Co v US 221 US 1 (1911)), and recognised as being the appropriate remedy (if necessary) by Justice Wyzasnski in the case of US v United Shoe Machinery Corporation (110 F Supplementary 295, 342 (1953)).
        </para>
        <para>
         The US court refused to order divestiture in the decision of Alcoa (US) v Aluminium Company 148 F 2d 416 (2d Cir 1945)). In that case Judge Hand made a finding against Alcoa but when the case went back to the court for the order to be made, Judge Knox refused to order a break up of Alcoa which had been sought by the Government although certain shareholdings by Alcoa in Canadian companies were ordered to be divested.
        </para>
        <para>
         There are cases in which courts have ordered divestiture--for example the movie industry and in particular the ownership of movie houses has been the subject of some interesting decisions--see for example US v Griffiths (334 US 100 (1948)).
        </para>
        <para>
         Divestiture for Australia
        </para>
        <para>
         The power of divestiture which is present in the US law and which is regarded as central to the administration of their antitrust laws has rarely been used, as students of American antitrust law continue to remind us. Similarly, it has rarely been used in other jurisdictions where it is available--in Canada and Europe. But the fact that it is available and can be used by the court in the appropriate circumstances, and has not been withdrawn despite pleas that it is too draconian and remains a telling factor in evaluating the appropriateness of US antitrust law. Indeed judges will rarely ever want to impose such a drastic remedy as divestiture if one means by that the breaking up of a corporation.
        </para>
        <para>
         But "divestiture" as I use the term can take a number of different forms--for example requiring a company to give up its shares in a related corporation (as Knox J ordered in the Alcoa case in relation to Alcoa and its holding in the Canadian companies);  or to give up part of its distribution network (as was ordered in the cinema cases in the United States--e.g. Griffiths).
        </para>
        <para>
         There are situations where unless the court is given power to rewrite the particular arrangements which are the basis of the power that is the "springboard" from which the misuse is "generated", we will be unable to bring about effective competition. Let me give you an example which is unlikely to go to the courts in this form but which could, in a different scenario, have led to a significant amount of embarrassment to our current Government. When the Government decided to deregulate civil aviation in 1987 it decided that Ansett and Australian, both of which had devoted considerable resources to this industry (and had been significantly protected from competition by the two airline policy) should be given long term leases (30 years in effect) over the major terminals in the capital cities. Recognising that new entrants would have to be given some opportunity to enter the market, the Government at the same time "required" the two airlines to provide two gates in each of the cities of Melbourne and Sydney and one gate in each of the other cities to any new approved entrants once deregulation occurred.
        </para>
        <para>
         The immediate question asked was would this "concession" be enough to allow new entrants to effectively compete. Right from the start Compass Airlines, which is the only new entrant to have made any impact in the market (indeed its impact has been quite significant) has indicated that it is working under severe disadvantage by being unable to obtain use of more than two gates in Sydney and Melbourne. The terms under which Compass has been allowed the use of relevant gates has in my view been negotiated firmly but fairly by Australian Airlines. Recently Compass could not come to terms with Australian in relation to the start up of its Adelaide operations and had to make alternative arrangements for "gates". Brian Grey has indicated that he does not believe Compass will be able to gain a much bigger share of the market unless the infrastructure that currently exists in the airline industry is rewritten, i.e. the access question is reassessed.
        </para>
        <para>
         If there were evidence of misuse of market power on the part of Australian Airlines (I take Australian Airlines simply because it is the airline through which Compass obtains its access to the airports) what remedy could the court impose?  An injunction would probably be inadequate in the context of Compass' desire to gain a bigger share of the market which it might believe it was entitled to through its vigorous competitive behaviour. Taking away from Australian the right to use the terminals it has a 30 year lease over would be too drastic a remedy in the context of the misuse of market power that might arise in these particular situations. But what about the rewriting of the 30 year leases to require Australian to provide say three or four gates at Sydney and Melbourne and an increase elsewhere for fair compensation?  This is not possible in my view under the current law.
        </para>
        <para>
         Some of the operators in the industries that were tightly regulated (e.g. airlines, telecommunications, etc.) until recently are almost in a position of natural monopolies or natural duopolies. The potential remedies under the Trade Practices Act (which as I have indicated would not include the ability to rewrite those 30 year leases on my reading of s.87 of the Act) would mean that if there were serious breaches of the law the courts would be left with a limited range of remedies that they could provide to the parties--injunctions, small penalties and no real ability, as the US writers assert, to get at the heart of the problem.
        </para>
        <para>
         Apart from airlines of course we have the telecommunications industry and there may be others (energy is about to be opened up to some form of competition) where the sheer size and protection of the existing monopolists and duopolists might be so significant as to create very significant barriers to new entrants.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government has signalled very recently that it will empower the Broadcasting Tribunal to order "divestiture" of the cross media rules (as amended) are breached;  if such power is to be given to this Tribunal why is it so horrendous to arm the Federal Court with such a power if there is a serious misuse of power (and it will only be the most serious case in which the remedy will be sought!!)?
        </para>
        <para>
         Purpose or Effect
        </para>
        <para>
         Another change that might be considered to s46 so as to in effect bring it on par with the other provisions of the statute (other than the mergers provision) is to prevent the misuse of market power where the purpose or effect of the misuse is to create detriment to the competitive environment--ie to lead to a substantial lessening of competition. If an effects test was introduced (as has been suggested by the Trade Practices Commission especially in relation to the deregulated industries) other parts of the section would have to be changed, in my view, to make sure that it is the competitive process rather than competitors that will have to be shown to have been damaged to obtain the necessary relief. If we do not change the impact of the relevant conduct this may amount to swinging the pendulum too far the other way. Such an approach would create significant opportunities for new entrants to gain an advantage that they would be unable to obtain through normal market forces.
        </para>
        <para>
         Other Restrictive Trade Practices
        </para>
        <para>
         The Commission's continued success in Resale Price Maintenance cases for example, TPC v Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd ((1989) ATPR 40-976) and TPC v General Corporation Japan Pty Ltd ((1989) ATPR 40-922) and in TPC v Sony (Australia) Pty Ltd &amp;Ors ((1990) ATPR 41-053) (discussed elsewhere in this report) reflect the fact that this practice remains regrettably high on the work list of the Commission. Price fixing also occupies a good deal of the Commission's time--not naked price fixing but arrangements and practices which it has been alleged lead to price fixing. The existence of concentrated industry sectors, where oligopoly and duopoly is often the norm, has contributed to a public perception that collusion is at the heart of some industries. Even assuming that there are grounds for supporting these allegations, the proof which is necessary to establish the existence of an arrangement (or understanding) which amount to a breach of s45 of the Act, is so difficult to establish that there will be very few cases which the Commission will wish to run in this area.
        </para>
        <para>
         Of course the penalties which may be handed down by the courts (see discussion of penalties) are not conducive to the Commission instituting court proceedings in this regard. This in turn has led to the Commission seeking to go down a different route in reaching agreement in various cases--e.g. Toshiba, Pacific Dunlop and Solomons Carpet--all of which are discussed elsewhere in this report.
        </para>
        <para>
         Penalties
        </para>
        <para>
         There is now a recognition of the inadequacy of the penalties which may be imposed by the courts. These two extracts from leading cases in 1990 are evidence of that.
        </para>
        <para>
         The first case to note is TPC v Sony (Australia) Pty Ltd and others ((1990) ATPR 41-053) Pincus J made these comments about the inadequacies of current penalties (at pp. 51, 690-51,692):
        </para>
        <para>
         `Were it not for the desirability of setting penalties conforming to the level found in the authorities (and in particular in the recent decision of the Full Court in Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v TPC ((1990) ATPR 41-019), I should have been inclined to assess penalties at higher sums than have in fact been fixed. When one finds deliberate breaches of the price maintenance provisions of the Trade Practices Act committee by a subsidiary of one of the greatest manufacturers of electronic consumer goods, after years of attempts to enforce compliance with these provisions, one can only suspect that the penalties have not been taken very seriously. Their deterrent effect has been insufficient, it appears, to counterbalance the profit apparently derived from protecting recommended prices against the effects of competition between their dealers.'
        </para>
        <para>
         The second major statement is Mr Justice French's decision in TPC v CSR Limited ((1991) ATPR 41-076) where he noted as follows (at p 52, 154):
        </para>
        <para>
         `. . . each case will fall to be decided according to its own circumstances. But the approach taken in the CUB case [TPC v Carlton and United Breweries Ltd (1990) ATPR 41-037] suggests, and I think it right, that large corporations contravening s46 of the Trade Practices Act can expect penalties in the upper reaches of the range for which the law presently provides. Indeed having regard to the size and strength of some of the corporations to which the section is addressed, it may be concluded that the present day value of the maximum penalty no longer reflects the seriousness with which Parliament intended contraventions of Pt IV to be treated when the Act was passed in 1974.'
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Duffy recently announced an intention to increase penalties to $5 million (although he did not dismiss the possibility of going as high as $10 million). What is even more important, however, is the development of a policy on penalties. What should we be trying to achieve with the penalty regime? Alternatives such as a disgorgement of profits should not be dismissed without some detailed consideration.
        </para>
        <para>
         Consumer Protection
        </para>
        <para>
         In addressing various issues I have not touched much on the area of consumer protection. This is in some respects more important than the competition issues because we are dealing by and large with problems which confront the `have nots'--the regrettably increasing number of Australians who find the cost of justice beyond their reach and who therefore come to rely more and more on regulatory agencies to act on their behalf.
        </para>
        <para>
         The separation of the Ministerial responsibilities between the Attorney-General and a Minister of Consumer Protection, with establishment some years ago of a separate departmental structure (The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs) has meant a higher profile for aspects of this area of responsibility, whilst also creating unnecessary competition within the Department and the TPC for resources and attention in dealing with the problem areas. Whilst the States and Territories have now each established separate legislation (Fair Trading Acts) to replicate (almost totally) the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and whilst the Commission during my term took a number of steps to bring about greater cooperation and coordination of the work of the relevant agencies (the setting up of CADMAC being the most recent innovation), I believe the Commission should do more for the consumer than it is able to do.
        </para>
        <para>
         In particular I felt rather helpless to assist the many consumers who had been left in a fairly invidious position as a result of many instances of what appeared on the surface to be unfair and at times harsh behaviour by financial institutions including the banks, and by some of the high flying companies of the 1980s. But the most significant incidence of unfair behaviour was in the smaller businesses area; they (ie small business) in turn were often the victims of the type of behaviour. Because of the limited resources the Commission took the hard decision to limit our involvement in business scams, such as the get rich quick schemes, franchising rorts (especially in relation to such schemes) and areas such as land sales. No sooner would the Commission succeed in stopping one such activity (even with well publicised court cases) than others would crop up to frustrate and blunt the successes of the part.
        </para>
        <para>
         The development of alternative strategies to deal with such practices was a primary activity of the Commission. Our colleagues at CADMAC (referred to below) and I felt that the introduction of cease and desist orders as part of the `arsenal' available to the Commission (and State and Territory agencies) was a matter deserving urgent attention and appropriate action. I recognise there may be some constitutional difficulties in developing a scheme which might replicate the US system which has been part and parcel of the Federal Trade Commission's `arsenal' for many years.
        </para>
        <para>
         At the time of my retirement from the Commission I understood that some good work was being done in the Federal Bureau on this and related topics concerning remedies; the Commission itself was undertaking some preliminary work the results of which might be of very real use to the Bureau in its endeavours. As should be the case of other proposals for reforms one hopes that any discussions appear to consider these issues is made available for considered public comment at the earliest possible time.
        </para>
        <para>
         Working with Governments and the Community
        </para>
        <para>
         The establishment of the Consultative Committee and CADMAC during my term have been outstanding successes. The Consultative Committee has been invaluable in ensuring that the Commission receives the best possible advice from interested groups (from all sectors of the community) in developing guides, position papers and background information for the community and government. The Background Paper on s46 of the Act, the Report produced on the possible extension of s52A of the Act to small business; and the soon to be released paper on the interface between intellectual property rules and trade practices rules, all benefited enormously from input provided by representatives of the groups sitting on the Consultative Committee.
        </para>
        <para>
         Elsewhere in this report there is a description of the work of CADMAC. This group was established at my initiative at the SCOCAM Meeting in Perth in July 1990 (Meeting of Consumer Affairs Ministers and Officials) and with Allan Asher and Bill Dee from the Commission providing guidance it has been able to ensure greater cooperation between the Commission and the Consumer Affairs Agencies.
        </para>
        <para>
         Coordination between the Commission and the Australian Securities Commission which was formally set up in March 1991 has in the ensuing months produced significant cooperation between the two bodies; it will be important to see if this can be extended to the heart of the area of agreement--the provision of better results to disgruntled investors who have been the victims of misleading investment schemes, advertising or practices. The Commission, encouraged by its success in setting up these arrangements with the Australian Securities Commission, at the time of my retirement had been negotiating similar arrangements with the Insurance Commission to cover the overlap between Trade Practices law and the Insurance industry.
        </para>
        <para>
         With the appointment of Associate Commissioners from the Prices Surveillance Authority and Austel it is not surprising that there has been considerable cooperation between these two bodies and the Commission. The Commission also enjoyed a close coordination of the Channel 10 restructuring with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and I had discussions with Peter Westerway on the possible appointment of an Associate Commissioner from that body (or rather its `successor') in due course. Of course this is a matter of government policy but in the light of the continued interest in the media generally such a cross appointment seems desirable.
        </para>
        <para>
         Our relationship with the New Zealand Commerce Commission has been very strong and I look forward to the day when the two Commissions can sit formally together, or some alternative mechanism is put into place to allow greater coordination of the work of these two bodies as the concept of one market involving Australia and New Zealand becomes more realistic.
        </para>
        <para>
         Many other agencies and organisations agreed to cooperate with the Commission over the past years and it would be invidious for me to name each of them. But perhaps the most satisfying development in that regard has been the increasing recognition of the Australian Commission by our OECD partners and the OECD itself. Despite quite amazingly reactive opposition from the Attorney-General's Department but with the  Attorney-General's approval (both Bowen and Duffy) I attended a number of meetings of the Competition Policy Committee in Paris (as an observer but on two occasions without the benefit of departmental representatives). These meetings were very productive and have led to the Commission's work becoming even better known than it had been for some years. The invitation for me to join the Bureau (which is the Executive Committee of the Committee) was an honour for Australia (I could not join for reasons of timing and protocol). There should be a complete rethink by the Department to ensure that the Commission representative is given formal standing at this Committee so that he or she can serve on the Bureau if invited.

         The Profile of the Commission
        </para>
        <para>
         When I joined the Commission it had a regrettably low profile--many mistook it for the National Companies and Securities Commission; others felt it had been too `soft' in dealing with mergers and consumer protection (due to a large extent to a misunderstanding of the resource constraints imposed on the Commission). Certainly our relationship with the press was a `tense' one.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is obvious that this profile has changed. This has been due to a number of factors
        </para>
        <para>
         (a) our politicking for better resources.
        </para>
        <para>
         (b) our high profile court `cases' such as Queensland Wire, Arnotts, CUB, CSR, and our authorisation push such as Pasminco and ACI-Smorgon as well as our stand against applications which had insufficient assets (such as the Daily News authorisation).
        </para>
        <para>
         (c) the overdue recognition of the role of competition law in our micro-economic reform push by the various Ministers culminating in the Prime Minister's statement of 12 March.
        </para>
        <para>
         (d) our engagement in high profile studies and research such as the Professions and Small Business and s52A of the Act.
        </para>
        <para>
         (e) various speeches delivered by me and my colleagues including two Press Club speeches by me which received significant press and other media coverage.
        </para>
        <para>
         (f) the growing disenchantment with aspects of the law--e.g. penalties by the judges, the merger test as it applied to the media, etc.
        </para>
        <para>
         There are no doubt other reasons for this profile having been changed. I make no apology for pushing the profile into the forefront as I firmly believe that if we are to have a successful campaign for the creation of a competitive Australia we must have relevant and practical trade practices law which has clear aims, together with properly resourced agencies and courts (and departments) to undertake the task of ensuring that the law is administered and interpreted in an appropriate way.
        </para>
        <para>
         Without doubt my success on raising the profile of the Commission has been largely due to the work of the Information and Compliance Branch of the Commission led by John Adey, and the hard work the Commissioners, staff and lawyers within the Australian Government Solicitor's sub-office under the leadership of Bob Alexander.

          —-I thank the Senate. I really cannot understand why the new Chairman, Professor Fels, refused to include this chapter in the annual report. There is no doubt that the chapter makes considerable criticism of the Government but it also, in some paragraphs, praises it. There are a number of major criticisms of the Government in the report, but I am sure that the Government is quite capable of accepting a criticism by a retiring member of one of its statutory authorities. If the Attorney-General feels like responding to the criticism, I am sure that the Attorney-General is quite capable of doing so.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The criticisms have been made frequently in this place: a lack of funding; the failure of the Government to understand the need for micro-economic reform; and the failure of the Government to appreciate the need for the Trade Practices Commission to have the funds and the resources to act quickly, especially in a market which is being deregulated. I do not want to spend too much time on the criticisms of the Government. The document is now incorporated in Hansard and honourable senators and others will be able to read those criticisms.
        </para>
        <para>
         As I said, I cannot understand why Professor Fels refused to have the chapter written by the retiring Chairman included in the annual report. Professor Baxt raises many things in this chapter which are of major importance for the consideration of the future of trade practices in Australia. Not only does he deal with the resources of the Commission, but also he deals with the Commission being able to take one of two roles. He states:
        </para>
        <para>
         It can sit back and await the occurrence of breaches of the law and then react to those breaches as a policeman might. It can be a very strict enforcer of the law. Or it can take a proactive approach and seek to educate the community;
        </para>
        <para>
         That is an area which ought to be considered at length.
        </para>
        <para>
         I see that my time has almost expired. Professor Baxt has a section on competition policy and micro-economic reform and he deals with a number of major problems which arise out of that. He comes up with a number of suggestions as to what might happen in the trade practices area--developments which might take place. Clearly, these are matters which the Parliament of Australia ought to consider, not just the Attorney-General. Professor Baxt deals with the problem of whether we should return to a test of substantially lessening competition or remain with the dominance test. Interestingly enough--I am sure Senator Spindler will be interested to know this--Professor Baxt believes that the dominance test is, in fact, viable. I am sure that those honourable senators who take the opportunity to read the chapter in Hansard will find it of great interest, and perhaps of more interest than the report actually being tabled today.

          —-I, too, want to say a few words about the 1990-91 annual report of the Trade Practices Commission. I note with considerable interest the significance of the action taken by Senator Lewis in having incorporated into Hansard the missing chapter of the report from the former Chairman, Professor Baxt. I take this opportunity to congratulate Professor Baxt on the work he did during his term as Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission. I did not always agree with the direction in which he was taking the Commission and some of the decisions that were taken; nevertheless, I fully and publicly recognise the major contribution that he made whilst he was there.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         I wish Professor Fels all the best in his term of office. He is coming in at a very important time. If the action that he has undertaken--that Senator Lewis referred to--smacks of censoring, as far as this first report since he has been Chairman is concerned, obviously that would be a matter for some concern.
        </para>
        <para>
         If Professor Baxt's missing chapter was highly critical of the Government, I think that if we read between the lines of the actual published report, we would find that it is also highly critical of the Government. It demonstrates clearly that when it actually comes to micro-economic reform the Government is all wind and vapour--it is all rhetoric--with no substance and no performance.
        </para>
        <para>
         It was on 12 March, in the famous industry statement, that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself announced that the Government had decided to expand the coverage of the Trade Practices Act to cover those many areas of the Australian economy that are presently immune from it, including some Commonwealth enterprises, State public sector businesses and significant areas of the private sector including the professions.
        </para>
        <para>
         Seven months later, nothing has happened. The only way that the coverage of the Trade Practices Act can be extended is through legislation in this Parliament. This Parliament is still waiting to see one word of what might be proposed in terms of legislative detail. If the Government is really serious--really fair dinkum--about the importance of micro-economic reform, as it professes to be, it is incomprehensible that it could have had this degree of delay in bringing anything to the Parliament.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Prime Minister in his March statement said that the matter would be discussed with State Premiers at the Special Premiers Conference which, at that time, was to be held in May. It was subsequently deferred to July, and I acknowledge that. Nevertheless, the fact is that micro-economic reform in this country is of the greatest urgency. The improvement of competition and a competitive environment in this country is of the greatest importance. The reduction in the cost structures that so cripple Australian industry and Australian business is important, yet the Government has done nothing at all in the area of the Trade Practices Act and the operations of the Trade Practices Commission to further the cause of additional competition policy and a reduction of costs in this country.
        </para>
        <para>
         I note that and will look with great interest at the work of the Commission under its new Chairman, Professor Fels. I hope that that work will add to the improvement of the competitive position of the Australian economy and look to continuing criticism by the Commission of the Government if it continues to fail in its responsibilities.

       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to provide the SBS with a new Charter and the full range of corporate powers appropriate to an independent public authority. The decision to develop the Bill was announced in the Government's National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia, launched in July 1989. The agenda defines the Commonwealth Government's multicultural policies and the goals that underlie them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia emphasises that the nation's cultural institutions, including the media, have a critical role to play in both mirroring and shaping Australians' image of themselves. Our institutions need to be responsive to Australia's diverse community in which four out of 10 Australians are immigrants or the children of immigrants, half of them from non-English speaking backgrounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government regards the SBS as both a special service for Australians of non-English speaking background and as a genuinely multicultural broadcaster for the benefit of all Australians, regardless of background.
       </para>
       <para>
        The establishment of separate legislation for the SBS will secure the future of the SBS and will express and guarantee the multilingual and multicultural character of the broadcaster.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation defines the Charter of the SBS and sets out its structure, powers and responsibilities. It removes from the Broadcasting Act the provisions relating to the establishment and management of the SBS. The principal effect of the legislation will be to establish the SBS as a statutory authority with similar powers and operational structures to the ABC, taking account of statutory authority and Government business enterprise reforms where appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for the introduction of a new Act, the Special Broadcasting Service Act and consequential amendments of the Broadcasting Act 1942 and a range of other Acts. The new staffing provisions will commence on proclamation. All other provisions will commence 28 days after the legislation receives Royal Assent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the detail of the proposed legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new legislation for the SBS provides the Government, the SBS and the public with a clear statement of the SBS's intended role. It also establishes management, advisory, accountability and staffing structures appropriate to the functions of the new corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        An important underlying theme of the legislation is to provide the SBS with greater flexibility in the management of its operations. At the same time there is a need to put in place adequate measures to ensure that the SBS operates efficiently and is accountable through the responsible Minister and the Parliament to the Australian people who own and fund it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The SBS Charter establishes the primary role of the SBS as being Australia's multicultural broadcaster. It provides a broad statement of the main objective of the SBS which will be to provide multilingual and multicultural broadcasting services which inform, educate and entertain all Australians, and in doing so, reflect Australia's multicultural society.
       </para>
       <para>
        The specific charter objectives recognise the wide-ranging role of the SBS. The SBS will be expected to meet the needs of ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities for information and entertainment in languages other than English, and to contribute to the retention and development of language and other cultural skills now present in Australia. It will be expected to increase awareness of the contribution of a diversity of cultures to the continuing development of Australian society and to promote understanding and acceptance of that diversity. The SBS will also be expected to extend the range of Australian television and radio services, to make use of Australia's creative resources and to contribute greatly to the overall diversity in Australian broadcasting.
       </para>
       <para>
        In practice, the SBS's approach to fulfilling its Charter will differ between television and radio, reflecting the inherent characteristics of these different broadcasting media. SBS radio will continue to mainly provide programs in languages other than English which cater for the needs of a wide range of communities. SBS television will provide programming in both English and community languages, reflecting the needs and interests of all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The SBS will continue to be primarily funded from the Budget. It will, however, as a subsidiary function to its charter obligations, also be able to conduct business or other activities to the fulfilment of the Charter, with a view to generating off-budget revenue. In addition, the SBS will have the opportunity of increasing its revenues  through advertising and sponsorship.
       </para>
       <para>
        To assist the SBS to undertake permitted business activities, the legislation will allow it to enter into partnerships or other business arrangements with the agreement of the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        These business activities should not detract from the SBS's primary charter responsibilities. The SBS will be subject to a range of corporate planning and annual reporting requirements. The SBS will be required to identify, in advance, the corporate objectives, including forecasts of revenue and expenditure, and overall strategies and policies to be followed by the SBS, and its subsidiaries, for meeting those objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the current legislation, the SBS is already able to accept money for the sponsorship of programs. Accordingly, it has, over the past 12 months, entered into a number of successful sponsorship agreements which have enabled it to purchase programs which have attracted high audience ratings such as the World Cup Soccer Series and `The Civil War'. The additional revenue it can expect to attract from advertising will enable it to further improve its services and, in particular, to produce more programs of its own.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sensitive to the concern that advertising and sponsorship revenue funding has the potential to alter the scheduling and content of SBS programs. The distinctive character of the SBS will, therefore, be preserved through a number of measures. Foremost there is the detailed Charter and the obligation on the Board to ensure the independence and integrity of the SBS, also, the SBS Board will be required to report annually to Parliament on how its programming activities have related to its Charter obligations. It will also be required to report on the detail of the advertising and sponsorship arrangements it has entered into.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the legislation limits the amount of advertising and sponsorship announcements the SBS can sell to five minutes per hour and requires that the announcements be broadcast only between programs or in natural program breaks. The five minute limitation will not apply to announcements for which the SBS receives no payment or other consideration--for example, community announcements or the promotion of the SBS's own programs and products. The SBS will be generally subject to the same statutory control on advertising as the commercial broadcasters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Within these statutory limitations, the SBS Board will have discretion to determine a range of matters about the types of advertising and sponsorship announcements it will broadcast and when they will be broadcast. The Board will be required to develop and publish guidelines on these  matters, and may refuse advertisements which do not comply with its guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect on the commercial broadcasting sector of the introduction of advertising and sponsorship is not expected to be significant. The SBS audience share is relatively smaller and its advertising revenue share is expected to reflect this. Furthermore, the SBS serves many distinct audiences and has the potential to appeal to companies which do not presently advertise on radio or television.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation allows the SBS to borrow money from the Commonwealth or other sources with Ministerial approval and to offer its assets as security. It will permit the Commonwealth to guarantee the loans. The legislation also confers powers to enter into hedging contracts to reduce the risks of foreign exchange or interest rate fluctuations and to invest surplus funds in a manner approved by the Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        These powers are consistent with the greater independence and accountability of the SBS in financial matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The size of the SBS Board will be increased by two to reflect its increased statutory responsibilities. Although there are no formal qualification requirements for Board members, members will collectively be required to possess expertise in the areas needed to govern the SBS effectively. For this purpose, members will be required to have an understanding of multiculturalism and of the needs and interests of the SBS's culturally diverse audience. They will also be required to have between them a diversity of cultural perspectives. At least one member will be required to have an appropriate understanding of the interests of employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making appointments to the SBS Board, the Government will actively seek equitable representation of women, young people and people of different ethnic backgrounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Managing Director of the SBS will be the only full-time member of the Board. He or she will be appointed by the Board and be responsible to it for the conduct of the SBS's business. Other appointments to the Board will be made by the Governor-General.
       </para>
       <para>
        The SBS requires a flexible staffing regime that can accommodate a range of employment arrangements. Accordingly the SBS will be empowered to engage staff in accordance with terms and conditions determined by the SBS. However, the Government expects the terms and conditions, including internal administrative arrangements, to be developed in full consultation with the unions. The new staffing provisions will not commence operation until the Government is satisfied that there has been full consultation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the SBS will be expected to adhere to the Government's policies on industrial relations matters with possible flow-on or policy impact, including pay and conditions of service issues, and matters such as industrial democracy, occupational health and safety, and technological change.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Board will be required to develop and publicise the SBS's programming policies and its policies on the handling of complaints. The Government is separately reviewing public accountability arrangements in relation to both the ABC and SBS. As part of that review, the Government will consider the adequacy of existing arrangements for program standard setting and complaints handling and the appropriate role of external bodies such as the Ombudsman and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The SBS Board will be expected to ensure that SBS programming is responsive to the changing needs of SBS audiences, and to take account of community opinion in developing programming strategies and policies for fulfilling the Charter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consultative mechanisms for gauging community needs and opinions will be determined by the SBS Board. The Board will be required to describe these measures in the corporate plan. Due to the public interest in effective consultation, this element of the corporate plan will be subject to alteration by the Minister, if considered necessary. Through this process, the Minister will be empowered to require the SBS Board to establish an advisory council if the Minister is not satisfied with the consultative arrangements planned by the Board.
       </para>
       <para>
        To assist the Board to develop appropriate community consultative mechanisms for inclusion in its first corporate plan, the Board will be required to establish an interim community advisory committee constituted by persons with an understanding of multiculturalism together with  interests, skills and experience relevant to ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This committee will be disbanded when the first corporate plan is provided to the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        The independence of the SBS from Government influence is an important policy objective. The legislation aims to guarantee this independence in programming and editorial matters, but at the same time ensure that the SBS, as a Budget-funded organisation, is properly accountable to the Australian public for expenditure of its money.
       </para>
       <para>
        The SBS will be expected to adopt relevant Government policies in the performance of its functions where these do not conflict with the exercise of its statutory responsibilities. Also, the Minister may formally direct  the SBS Board on matters and circumstances which are prescribed in regulations but not on programming or scheduling matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments in the Bill will not alter the costs or revenues of the Commonwealth. They do not require the application of additional resources by the SBS to meet its new charter obligations or to comply with its establishment and management responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government sees the SBS as playing a vital role in the enjoyment of being Australian. The SBS also meets real communications needs for many Australians. The SBS has won acclaim for its successes in radio and television, which the Government recognises and applauds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's commitment to the SBS has been evidenced by the decision to continue indexed Budget funding for a further three years and to allow the full retention of non-Budget income including income from sponsorships and advertising. The Government has also authorised borrowing to allow the SBS to purchase its own headquarters building.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill seeks to provide the foundations for a stable future for the SBS. We are confident that with solid legislative and financial underpinning, the SBS will continue to offer a fine and improving service to all Australians.

         —-The Budget brought down by the Government just two months ago is now in a complete shambles. We have heard via the media that the health portion of the Budget has been changed. We have also heard via the media that the Left of the Australian Labor Party instructed the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to change the Medicare co-payment for that bulkbill service from $3.50 to $2.50. In case this proved a deterrent to bulkbilling, an additional one dollar should be reduced from the scheduled rebate of patients who are not bulkbilled.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would like to refer to the document Health Care in Australia--Directions for Reform in the 1991-92 Budget, because it is important that we get straight just what has been altered. We were told in the original Budget Paper that the changes will affect rebates and patient charges from general practice, and we know that that is the change from $3.50 to $2.50. It was to expand the Medicare safety net, and that one has not been changed. We were also told that it would have some impact on the quality and distribution of general practice through changes from 1 July 1992, following consultation with the profession, to provide more appropriate funding to assist the profession to improve the quality of care in general practice. Again, that has been changed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figure of $12m has been appropriated to bring that date forward from 1 July 1992, according to the old Budget figures, `to be implemented as soon as possible'. The Caucus meeting decided that an appropriation of $12m should be made for that purpose. Another dot point in the document referred to cutting over-servicing and improving the efficiency and quality of service in pathology and diagnostic imaging. While two out of four items have remained unchanged, two have been altered.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today we are debating these Appropriation Bills and obviously, if the alterations to which I have referred have taken place, the Bills must be amended. But the Government has not yet had the courtesy to make a statement in the Senate. This has all been done via the media--there has been no statement in the Senate at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the new figures that we are meant to be looking at? We know the old figures which are contained in the Budget Papers. In respect of outlays the old figure was $101.508 billion. But what are the new figures?  We have been told by the media that an additional $70m will be needed. Where is the money coming from?  We know that the original deficit was $4.732 billion. What will the new deficit be?  We have no idea. How much further will this Government put the country into debt to please the Left so that the Prime Minister can survive a leadership challenge?
       </para>
       <para>
        We have the highest unemployment in the history of this country, with a total of over one million people out of work. We also have the highest number of bankruptcies ever recorded in this country, and the highest overseas debt on record. Nearly one in four 15- to 19-year-olds are unemployed. But the Prime Minister is incapable of making the tough decisions because he is a captive of the Keating challenge. It is pathetic that this wonderful country is going down the drain because the Prime Minister is too scared to show a vestige of leadership.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the first time in the history of the country, the Prime Minister decided--when the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) had already made his statement to the Parliament--to send the Budget to a backbench committee of lefties to come up with an alternative Budget decision. He gave strict instructions to that committee, and let us not underestimate those, that the decision could not compromise the Budget figures or outcome. What happened?  The Budget has been amended because its integrity has been compromised. The figures no longer have any integrity. The whole thing is a shambles. Yet here we have the Government placing the Appropriation Bills on the agenda in this place for debate. These Bills are totally flawed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We went through a couple of weeks of Estimates committee hearings. The figures for the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, in which I am particularly interested, are totally wrong. While all this has been going on, the Prime Minister and his Treasurer have ducked off overseas. Mr Hawke probably realises that it is the last trip he will have overseas as Prime Minister. When he comes back I do not doubt for a minute that Mr Keating will challenge him because no leadership has been shown on any of these issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unions, backbenchers, Labor Party members and the Premiers of both Victoria and Tasmania are all screaming, `For heaven's sake, just do something for the unemployed. Let there be no tough decisions'. Instead, the Prime Minister has given way to a leftie committee and a scrambling for votes for leadership. The Prime Minister rings Joan Kirner and says, `Pull Mr White into line'. As Laurie Oakes says, what a cheek. I quote Laurie Oakes:
       </para>
       <para>
        Hawke's cheek in demanding that Kirner discipline her industry minister, David White, was astonishing. This, after all, is the prime minister who was unable to phone his own employment minister, John Dawkins, about allegedly destabilising activities, and tried to rely on an intermediary to hose down Dawkins. The attempt to heavy Kirner was yet another serious lapse of political judgment by Hawke.
       </para>
       <para>
        All I can say to that, as do the backbenchers of the Labor Party, is that it certainly was.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have to have some leadership to get out of the mess that this Government has deliberately got us into. It deliberately created a depression with over one million unemployed people and deliberately forced record bankruptcies because Mr Keating, the then Treasurer, said, `We have to have a depression'. It is the only way he saw to deal with the economy in the country. Those in the Labor Party had better get out and tell those in the dole queues that their sacrifice is for the good of the country, because they do not know that Labor Party members consider their sacrifice as such.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at bankruptcies. In this last financial year, from June 1990 to June 1991, there were 12,991 bankruptcies--just on 13,000 bankruptcies. How many were there the previous financial year? There were 8,552. As if that were not bad enough, the Government brought it up this year to 13,000. In the last quarter to June 1991--in just three months--there were 4,030 bankruptcies. In the same quarter last year, it was about half that--that is, 2,605 bankruptcies. We were horrified at last year's figures; this year's figures are just about double them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Question Time yesterday, Senator Button said, `Oh, well, the Government got it wrong; we made a few mistakes'. In speaking in this debate on the Appropriation Bills, Senator Sherry said, `We are not perfect; we have made a few mistakes'. I suggest that Senator Button, Senator Sherry, Senator Cook, Senator Jones and the rest of the mob opposite get out, go down to the dole queues and apologise for the mistakes they have made because someone has to tell the unemployed that the Government is sorry for the plight they are in.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget, as presently being debated before the Senate, has not done a solitary thing for the unemployed. The only thing the Government has done is appropriate $800m for a better cities program.

        All the Government is going to give them as a result of that package is better quality pavements to queue up on, designer soup kitchens or better parks for the homeless to live in.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is all the Government has done for the unemployed. Over one million people are unemployed in this country. I wonder how many Opposition and Government senators have children in the 15- to 19-year-old age group; one in four members of that group are unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look more closely at unemployment. As I have just said, in my State nearly one person in four is unemployed. On the north-west coast of Tasmania, nearly one person in three is unemployed. What is the Government's response? It stopped the development of the Wesley Vale paper mill. That is what this Government did for unemployment on the north-west coast of Tasmania. As a result, one third of our 15- to 19-year-olds in that area are unemployed. I can assure Senator Cook that the better cities program will not help them. Let us look at the debacle of the health scheme that this Government set up. According to the Government, it does not really matter what happens to the health scheme or the health policy in this country; ideology is all important. Medicare is going broke, but we must retain ideology. Hospitals are closing beds, but we must retain our ideology. Queues are lengthening. Over 75,000 people have been queuing, some for years, but it does not matter because the Government says that we must retain our ideology. Pensioners cannot get into the hospitals, but the more wealthy in the community--for example, the friends of Mr Hawke--can get in whenever they want to. The hospitals have to take them because they need the money. But all that goes by the board because the ideology has to be retained.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not mind if ideology helped those in need, but all Bob's mates are the ones who will benefit. Bond, Packer, Skase, O'Connell all roll off the lips of those in the Labor mob over on the other side of the chamber, because ideology is what it is all about and it is ideology that says that people should be able to go to their doctor and not have to pay a thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does not matter one bit if we income test and assets test family allowances. But, according to the Government, we must not test health care. If people go to their doctors, they can receive their services for nothing so long as he or she bulkbills. I warn the medical profession: at the moment, something like 74 per cent of GPs in New South Wales are bulkbilling. Once they are all paid by the Government for bulkbilling, they are socialised. Once the Government pays a doctor's full income, there is no way that he or she is not socialised. Irrespective of whether doctors like it, that is the situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The doctors have to realise how this Government works. I have watched the pharmacists slowly but surely succumb to the temptation of accepting direct government payment, instead of the patient getting the subsidy and being responsible for payment. The pharmacists accepted direct payment when they should have rejected it and said to the Government, `You subsidise the patient coming with a prescription and we will just deal with the patient'. Many of the doctors are still doing that but many are succumbing, as the pharmacists did, to direct payment by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has happened to the pharmacists? They are now fully socialised. They are paid by the Government. They have to get permission to open up a pharmacy. If they want to open up a pharmacy in a country town or in a suburb, they cannot. They now have to go to the Government and plead their cause. I can assure honourable senators that the pharmacists are getting nowhere. They are fully socialised. The Government will not let them open a pharmacy without special permission. Indeed, the Government even pays them when they close a pharmacy. What further control could the Government have? It does not matter how essential the pharmacy is; the pharmacists cannot open one, but they get paid for closing one.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will explain to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who is in the chamber, and to honourable senators present, what the Government has set up. I do not think Senator Cook understands it. He can tell me later if he thinks it is the best way to spend taxpayers' money. I will give an example. A pharmacist owns two pharmacies. The first is a very old, viable pharmacy which fills lots of prescriptions. Fifty metres around the corner in a shopping mall is his second pharmacy. It was a mistake. It is going broke. For some reason it has not taken off. But his old pharmacy is doing very well. He can close the old pharmacy, get $80,000 from the Government and transfer the new pharmacy, which under normal market forces would have gone broke, to the position of the old pharmacy, without ever closing its doors. So the Government has paid $80,000 of taxpayers' money for a pharmacy that was going broke; it was in dire trouble. What a rort.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later on I would like the Minister to tell me whether he considers that to be a rort. If he does not, then I want it clearly understood that the taxpayers I speak to consider that this situation is a total rort. Yet, when I asked officers of the Department about this, they said, `No, it is all in the guidelines. That is quite permissible. A pharmacist can close a good pharmacy down. We will pay him $80,000 and he can move his no good pharmacy and put it in that position and never close his doors'. So a pharmacist is paid $80,000 for a pharmacy that would normally close through market forces. If the taxpayers in the gallery think that is the way their tax money should be spent, I would be most surprised. No taxpayers I talk to consider it anything but a rort. It is just socialist nonsense and a method by which the Government can have full control over the pharmacists.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will come back to the integrity of the Budget. The integrity of the Budget is just non-existent. We do not have the figures. When I asked Senator Button for the figures at Question Time he was so sensitive and upset about this change in Medicare that he rattled the figures off at a rate of knots. I then told him that I could not pick them up and asked him whether he would mind tabling them so I could have a look at them. He said, `No. They will be in Hansard tomorrow'. I am well aware that the figures will be in Hansard tomorrow, but I wanted them for this speech today. He is so sensitive about them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button is also very concerned about the integrity of the Budget. He knows that the figures we have in this document on health care are totally wrong. Supposedly, the saving in the original Budget was to be $940.7m in the year 1994-95. We know that those figures are no good now. Those figures are passe. We know that the Government has to find $70m from somewhere else. We know that it has now appropriated $4m of taxpayers' money just to go out and explain to the people the alteration in the Budget. The Government has appropriated $4m of taxpayers' money to tell the people that Bob Hawke had to give way to the Left. If he had not, he would have been rolled as a leader. So Bob Hawke had to set up a committee--

         —-The Prime Minister had to go out and spend $4m to tell the people that he had to change his Budget because, if he had not, he would have been deserted in the Caucus. He is spending an additional $4m to do that. He is also spending another $12m, as I have just said, to tell the medical profession that the Government has alternative ways in which that profession ought to conduct itself. Once the medical profession sees what is in this Budget, it will be horrified. I am not sure how many millions of dollars we are going to spend to implement practice grants to complement fee for service reimbursements. A practice grant will provide some remuneration to those general practices which choose to reduce their reliance on fee for service. The Government is going to give a doctor a practice grant so that he will be able to bulkbill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government wants to trial the use of practice budgets. Under this arrangement a budget is allocated to a general practice to cover the cost of diagnostic services and pharmaceuticals. So the Government will say to a practice, `There is your budget and don't overspend'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next item in the document is accreditation of general practices. The Government sees this as a natural development of the vocational registration arrangements, so it tells us. Those arrangements are a form of accreditation, but of individual practitioners. So individual practitioners will be accredited.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next item is supply and distribution of medical practitioners. The Government will look at the medical immigration numbers, outputs from medical schools and the distribution of medical practitioners. Does that sound familiar? The distribution of medical practitioners sounds so similar to the distribution of pharmacies. Soon doctors will have to apply to the Government before they can set up practice.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the medical profession does not take this warning and get out of bulkbilling, does not reassert the fact that there is a contract between it and its patients, and the Government subsidises the patient and not the doctor, it will find itself in exactly the same situation as the pharmacists are in today. Doctors will be crawling to the Government to say, `Please, can we open a medical practice?'. They will find that they are knocked back just as the pharmacists are being knocked back at the moment.

        The Government is in dire trouble and it was very obvious to this side of the Senate at Question Time today just what sort of trouble it is in. When we saw Senator Cook today organise that pathetically weak and appalling dorothy dixer to take up as much of Question Time as possible to relieve the other Ministers of questioning by the Opposition, we knew what sort of trouble the Government was in. Its method of handling these changes to the Budget clearly reflects the stress that Ministers are under, and it is time the Government cleared up its leadership problems and started to govern the country for the sake of all Australians.

         —-I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bills before the Senate and, in particular, to support the amendment moved by Senator Short. This amendment points out that Australia is suffering the worst recession in 60 years. Even Government spokesmen have started to concede the tragedy we are now facing as many families have to suffer the results of this Government's policies, which are causing unemployment.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If the public wants to find a clear example of why Australia finds itself in this predicament, it could find it by reading Senator Sherry's speech on this debate. Senator Sherry seems to think that the Government can impose a further tax on employers, the superannuation levy in this case, and have no effect on employment. Indeed, according to Senator Sherry's logic, this tax will benefit employment. If this is the case, one wonders why the Government has not immediately imposed a 10 or 20 per cent levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to Senator Sherry's logic and, indeed, that of Senator Cook, who is in the chamber now, this levy presumably would have no effect on employment levels in this nation. The reality is that this levy alone will cost up to 100,000 jobs. I suggest that Senator Sherry's shabby logic and his willingness to agree to trade union bosses' demands very succinctly explain what has happened to this Government and how it has derailed the Australian economy. Senator Sherry's arrogant demands that further imposts be placed on employers in the midst of a recession indicate that Labor, its Ministers and its back bench have learnt nothing from the results of the last eight years.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt whatsoever about the cause of the recession. Mr Keating indicated it in his memorable words, `This is a recession engineered by the Government, a recession we had to have'. Senator Button has indicated on a number of occasions in this chamber that the Government misjudged its economic strategy. It kept interest rates too high for too long. What the Government has not told us and what we wait to hear day after day in this chamber when we pose questions to Senator Cook and to Senator Button is how this Government is going to engineer a recovery. The Government can engineer a recession--no-one is arguing that point--but we are still waiting to hear its plans to see how it can engineer a recovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        The members of Caucus are in a high state of panic, knowing that they will lose their parliamentary jobs as punishment for allowing the Government to put one million people out of their jobs. All those Labor senators and MPs, the men and women who laughed and cheered behind Mr Keating as he boasted about his policies and the Government, are now in a state of blind panic.
       </para>
       <para>
        When Mr Keating was Treasurer it was very interesting to go over to the other place to see how he boasted about his policies and what great policies they were. He heaped contempt on the Opposition when it pointed out that Australia was heading for a recession. The back bench of men and women of the Labor Party laughed with and cheered on this man. The reality is that those men and women who laughed and cheered will be laughing and cheering themselves out of a job--and deservedly so--because they defended this man. When they could have stood up and criticised the policies of Mr Keating and Mr Hawke, they laughed and jeered. They are going to pay, I suggest, a very heavy price.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the answer to the recession that we now have? Caucus, apparently, as I mentioned in a previous speech, has formed a subcommittee under Lloyd O'Neil to find out the reasons for unemployment in this nation today. One wonders why the Government needs a Caucus committee to explain the causes of unemployment. I would have thought it could be summed up in five simple words: Hawke, Keating, Button, Richardson and Cook. That is the answer Lloyd O'Neil has to find. It is quite simple and straightforward. These five guilty men, a Prime Minister and four senior Ministers, have a unique dishonour, I suggest, in the history of the Federation of Australia. In 100 years they are the only Government Ministers who have openly boasted about engineering a recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is massive confusion amongst key Ministers about what strategy should be adopted to deal with unemployment. Indeed, as Senator Walters mentioned today, there is massive confusion in virtually all major policy areas of the Government: media, health, education and, as we learnt today, AIDEX--another split in Government ranks. It is no wonder that the Government is experiencing these splits and divisions because the nation is experiencing massive policy failure right across the broad range of government policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to deal with just one key issue on which I believe the Government is fundamentally split: what to do about unemployment. Senator Cook in his speech today in this debate drew our attention to some of the divisions in the Government in this area and I want to look at those divisions in some detail. I believe that a number of senior Ministers, particularly Senator Button, do not accept that this Government has a policy to deal with the economic crisis which is facing Australia. Perhaps Senator Button in the twilight of his career, mindful of the way his stewardship may well be viewed in our history books, is trying one final time to turn the Government away from its failed strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Barely a day goes by--Senator Short can confirm this--without television, radio or press reports on the alleged differences Senator Button has with the Government. One day last week there was a leaked letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Front page headlines followed that for two days. Then came Senator Button's inevitable television appearance, where he dropped broad hints about new directions in tax strategy. Further headlines followed. Then questions in Parliament on Senator Button's speculations led to further stories. Then came reports about Senator Button's differences with a Caucus decision--yet more media stories. As they say, one leak may be a mistake; two may be carelessness; but three leaks add up to a concerted campaign. A concerted campaign is being waged by a senior Minister against his own Government. That is what we are now seeing.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why Senator Short was quite right to highlight in his amendment to the Bills the divisions in the Government. I ask Senator Button and all senior Ministers:  how can the community hope to have any confidence whatsoever in this Government when one of its senior Ministers, Senator Button, differs so profoundly with the economic strategy the Government is pursuing?
       </para>
       <para>
        We all know that Mr Keating is campaigning against the Government--we read about that every day--and against, it has to be said, with more than a touch of irony, the very policies he supported while he was Treasurer. But Senator Button is a bit different: Senator Button is campaigning against his Government while remaining inside Cabinet and as Leader of the Government in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to highlight the areas where Senator Button is campaigning against his Government and against his Prime Minister. Surely industry policy is a key area of government policy and one directly concerned with Senator Button's stewardship. There is no question that Senator Button wants a more interventionist policy. On the Sunday program on Channel 9 last week, in relation to encouraging new industries in order to deal with what Senator Button called `chronic structural unemployment', this senior Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we need to have some sort of compensation in terms of developing new industries and new processes and expanding the manufacturing and services sector to take up that sort of unemployment which we now have.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button has not explained what sort of compensation he was talking about. Maybe Senator Cook can explain what sort of compensation Senator Button had in mind. But what did Mr Hawke say just four days previously? According to the Australian, he said he would not consider employment generation through Government support for untested industries. So much for Senator Button's views as far as the Prime Minister is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then Mr Crean weighed into the debate and said that the Government should help industries get over their initial hurdles. What sort of help is Mr Crean talking about? It is not spelt out. Finally, what does Mr Kerin say about Senator Button's more interventionist policies? He dismisses them by saying, `I have been looking at vision and it costs a lot of money'. What massive confusion we have in a key area of industry policy with the industry Minister campaigning against Mr Kerin, his Cabinet and his Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at taxation policy. This is the second major difference Senator Button has with the Government's direction. Taxation policy is surely a key area when one is thinking about incentives for the creation of jobs. Last Sunday on television, Senator Button said that taxation in Australia was possibly inhibiting investment. He suggested we look at taxation systems in other countries--principally our trading partners.

         —-Our colleagues in the Democrats and Opposition members asked Senator Button what features of the business tax systems of our major trading partners he found so attractive. Did he duck and weave!  He refused to tell us what he had in mind. Nonetheless, he was happy to go on television and drop these very broad and unsubtle hints.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Did Senator Button have in mind the tax the name of which no-one in the Labor Party dares utter--a goods and services tax, as Senator Walters mentioned?  If Senator Button looks through the Asia-Pacific region and looks at our major trading partners, he will find that one element of the tax system which makes it different from the tax system we have in Australia is a goods and services tax. The reality is that a number of our major trading partners in this region have a goods and services tax, which particularly encourages the export sector. Did Senator Button have that tax in mind? There have been press reports that Senator Button has said in private meetings with people in business that a goods and services tax is not such a bad idea. But still he cannot come out and say that. He wants to remain in the Government while he campaigns against the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        This working party, which has been set up to look at the different tax regimes in our region, will undoubtedly point to the goods and services tax. We on this side appreciate Senator Button attempting to draw the attention of the Government towards an important taxation reform that would encourage the export industry, which he has highlighted as needing further help.
       </para>
       <para>
        What does the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, say about Senator Button's suggestion that we need to look closely at reforming our business taxation system? The newspapers report Mr Kerin as saying that he doubts that the tax regime is hampering much-needed investment. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce wants a change in the tax structure for business; the  Treasurer immediately hits it over the head. All of these views by Senator Button and Mr Kerin have been made before the interdepartmental working party to study the matter has even met--incredible confusion!
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the resources policy. This is the third area where Senator Button profoundly differs with Government policy. Senator Button clearly believes that the Government policy on environmental and heritage concerns has held up major projects. Senator Button has no argument on this issue from the mining industry and, indeed, most observers. However, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, leaks departmental advice immediately, claiming to rebut Senator Button's contention that environmental and heritage claims are blocking investment and development.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button has listed a whole host of major projects which have been held up as a result of his Government's policies: magnesium development at Gladstone; iron ore at Marandoo; the Yabulu nickel refinery at Greenvale; and the list goes on and on. None of this convinces Mrs Kelly, and the press has been given detailed departmental submissions to reject or counter the arguments that Senator Button is putting forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this debate on a resources tax, the Prime Minister adds to his reputation as possibly the greatest jellyback in Australian history. Mr Hawke says what he wants to fast track is the debate on fast tracking. He does not want fast tracking of resources development; he wants fast tracking of the debate on fast tracking resources development. This is the man who is currently appointed to lead this country out of its worst recession in 60 years!
       </para>
       <para>
        It is about time that Senator Button made up his mind. If he believes that his Government's policies are a disaster for Australia--and there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that is the case--he has two choices: either he forces a change in Government policy to come more into line with his own views or he stands on principle and resigns. If he stays in this failed Government--a disastrous Government which will be condemned in Australian history, a Government which has wrought more damage on our economy and institutions than did the Whitlam Government and a Government whose policies he clearly rejects--he will rightly be condemned as a hypocrite and a wrecker; a man without the courage of his convictions.

         --The Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on 20 August recognises the problems facing rural communities. In this Budget there are a number of initiatives which assist farmers in rural communities. I wish to refer to projects in the electorate of Maranoa, an area in which I have taken a particular interest for a number of years. Farming communities in rural towns suffer from floods and the disruption and damage caused by them. Major floods in Queensland and New South Wales have been the focus of national attention in recent times. Charleville, an important centre for south-east Queensland, suffered severe damage from flooding in April 1990. Flooding ruined the entire commercial centre of the town and affected 82 per cent of the homes. If it were not for the determination of the people of Charleville, that town would have been abandoned. The Federal Government has funded, and will continue to fund, flood management projects in Queensland.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Budget includes $140,000 under the Federal water resources assistance program for a flood investigation for Charleville and Augathella. Funding also includes a further $100,000 in 1991-92 for an ongoing flood maintenance strategy for Dalby. Dalby has had 14 floods since 1908 with damage averaging $2.9m per year. In 1981 Dalby suffered $18m in flood damage, with 2,600 homes and 270 businesses being affected. All of us have been affected by floods in one way or another, but nothing compared with the loss of homes and belongings. In Dalby the Government is supporting a three-stage strategy which includes channel improvements, an automated flood warning system and a major bypass flood lane levee. These initiatives are part of a number of proposals by the Federal Government to help rural people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Farmers and graziers are suffering because of the difficult international economic times that we face. The beef industry in Australia has had to confront restrictions on its exports to the United States. The Chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, Mr Dick Austin, has described the US export limits as appalling in the current trade and political environment. Unfortunately, beef producers are already facing extreme hardship owing to the drought.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government is working hard to support farmers and their families. Initiatives include an improved family allowance supplement, increased funding for the rural counselling program, a business advisory scheme, a rural industry business extension service, increased funding for the rural adjustment scheme and a rural access program. Also included is assistance to the wool, citrus and dairy industries, and the list goes on. What does this package of initiatives mean for the rural industry? Very clearly, it means that this Government is prepared to help the rural sector in a variety of ways. The increased demand in the rural counselling program is evidence that the rural community welcomes this type of assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        What would the policies of the Liberal Party and the National Party do to assist farming and other rural communities? It would be a relief to hear that the Opposition would do nothing but unfortunately that is not the case. The threat of a consumption tax and a plan to cut off dole payments do not sit well with the rural families, nor with the National Party rank and file. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) assures us that the plan to cut off the dole after nine months is not intended to affect those genuinely in need. With a consumption tax riding on our backs and on the back of the rural sector, there will be very few without genuine need. We cannot be sure because we do not know what the so-called consumption tax will be.  It is a little like the coalition's infamous health policy a couple of years ago. It kept coming and coming but never quite arrived. The rural sector and the rest of Australia can only hope that the Opposition is as efficient now as it was then.
       </para>
       <para>
        About 10,000 families will benefit from the Government's increased family allowance and family allowance supplement payments. That is what rural families need, not some misguided free market anti-welfare strategy. These initiatives also show that this Government recognises that the rural economy has changed. By far the majority of jobs in the rural sector are now outside agriculture and mining. Farmers need to be assisted in establishing new industries and job opportunities and obviously they should include value added industries which will bring more wealth to the community and to this country. We need to regenerate economic activity in country areas and this includes an intelligent combination of primary, secondary and tertiary sectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another important policy of this Government relates to labour market and union reform. I am sure that, if Senator Kemp were here, he would agree about the union reform. The question is whether what he has in mind would be quite different from the sort of union reform that the Labor Government has in mind. Labour market reform is a high priority for this Government, as I said. This Government's efforts towards greater productivity and efficiency depend on constructive reform in the workplace. Obviously, that means both management and labour.
       </para>
       <para>
        The workplace reform program was introduced in 1988-89 and $20m has been allocated to this program in the past two years on top of the $25m already invested. In 1990-91 the following projects were supported: the completion of a network of workplace resource centres which operates on a fee for service basis;  the placement of work change advisers in industries playing a leading role in workplace reform;  the `It's Your Move' project with the Confederation of Australian Industry which provided training in industrial relations to nearly 8,000 supervisors;  and a number of publications including Practical Guides to Workplace Reform. The workplace reform program will continue to offer support to specific reform projects. Those projects that I have mentioned are specific;  they are real tools to bring about change. We are not talking in just general broad brush terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The program will also provide a comprehensive service of advice and assistance on industrial matters, industrial strategic planning, new technologies, work organisation, career structures and human resource management. It will assist industry to provide managers and workers with the skills necessary to implement reform at the enterprise level and it will provide a range of practical materials and information on key industries and issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Workplace reform is an important part of the Government's economic and industry restructuring program. If we are to get greater efficiency and productivity in industry, we need to be constructive in our approach to the workplace. In 1991-92 priority will be given to industry sectors with large employment bases that are of major economic importance. These include the tourism and hospitality, food processing, banking, finance, insurance, rail and meat industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Work will also continue in the major sectors of metals, engineering, building and construction, and vehicle manufacturing. This Government is active in all areas of economic management and planning. This comprehensive approach to the economy also includes union reform. The Government is continuing to support union amalgamation as part of this program of award and general industry restructuring. I do assert that, without that union amalgamation, that restructuring will not take place in a satisfactory way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will provide a further $2m in 1991-92 to assist the amalgamation process. Eighteen successful amalgamations occurred in 1990-91 and a further 18 amalgamation ballots currently are scheduled for 1991-92. I must point out that, without the benefit of government advice and financial support, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union came into existence, through intelligent amalgamations, and showed the way to the rest of the trade union movement. It continues to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will smooth the process of amalgamation. So we should see an escalation of the union rationalisation process as unions take advantage of these new provisions and the financial assistance that the Government continues to provide. It is pleasing to see the continued involvement of the union movement and the ACTU in this program. It highlights the unions' commitment to a more effective industrial relations system and to a more efficient and productive economy. It is very important for people to realise that both this Government and the union movement are committed to that approach because it will benefit all people in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are only three aspects of this Government's commitment to the future economic development of Australia's domestic and export industry. I am pleased to support this Government's continuing efforts to help Australian industries and to develop and continue to compete successfully at home and abroad.

         —-In speaking on Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991-92, I want to look at the economic climate, the performance of the now Treasurer, Mr Kerin, and indeed the way in which the Government as a whole is deteriorating to the detriment of Australia as a whole. Fairly recently I was caused to give a speech entitled, `Watch not: waste plenty'. In the preface to that speech I took a look at the history of this Government in the last 12 to 18 months. In specifically addressing the subject of waste I said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . the Budget represents the largest fiscal deterioration since the 1950's. The overall Public Sector Borrowing Requirement has moved from a surplus of 1.6% in 1988-89 into a prospective deficit of 4.3% in 1991-92.
       </para>
       <para>
        It failed to address the fundamental problem of a disastrously low level of national savings. The collapse in savings and investment has resulted in the 308,000 fall in employment over the last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, those figures are now out of date because we have now gone over 10 per cent for unemployment. My speech continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1.3 million underemployed and unemployed are no closer to getting a job under this budget and the Treasurer's admission in recent days that unemployment will remain in double digits for at least two years is the final indictment of his own budget strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the fiscal deficit of $4.7 billion is an accounting fiddle. Subtract asset sales, the transfer of maturing debts to the States, net payments from GBE's and additional profit transfers from the Reserve and Commonwealth Banks and you get an actual deficit of about $7.7 billion in 1991-92. The Budget deficit represents the largest turnaround in Federal budget numbers since the Second World War (a turnaround of $8.5 billion for the last year alone and a staggering $14.6 billion in two years).
       </para>
       <para>
        The necessary bond sales of $11 billion this year will ensure that real interest rates remain amongst the highest in the OECD.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 5% superannuation levy is a de facto payroll tax and will clearly add to inflation, not to mention a rise in unemployment by about 100,000. One man's super is another man's job.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the Treasurer's and the Prime Minister's protestations this budget is a return to good old fashioned Keynesianism, a pump priming budget. In real terms this financial year, after a massive increase of 6.3% in 1990-91, the Commonwealth's own account spending will be back above the 1982-83 levels as a percentage of GDP.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the light of those comments I made about a month or so ago, it was interesting to read a speech by Mr Kerin dated 10 October which he gave during a motion of censure which was being moved in the other place. As I read this collection of words which passes for a speech, I suppose, several things struck me about it:  firstly, its paucity of content; and secondly, when he attempted to attack the Opposition rather than defend the indefensible--that is the Government--he used figures in such a misleading way which can only lead me to believe that he really does not understand them. That is really a great concern, when I am talking about the Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Kerin was dealing with the situation of New Zealand and making the comparison with the introduction of a goods and services tax. He was saying that we were using New Zealand as a model. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        New Zealand failed because it did not have a wages policy in its essential restructuring.
       </para>
       <para>
        He said that the Opposition was to be criticised because it had a policy position that aimed to have inflation down to between 0 and 2 per cent. He went on to say, when he was trying to attack the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Reith, that the introduction of the goods and services tax had resulted in interest rates leaping to 25 per cent and inflation to 19 per cent and that this was the record of the GST. To say that those figures are misleading is to understate the situation to an enormous degree.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said that they are so misleading as to cause me to believe that he really does not understand how the taxation reforms in New Zealand have impacted on the economy of New Zealand. I would suggest that he read today's international news AAP Bulletin. In it there is a report from Wellington which says:
       </para>
       <para>
        A better than expected inflation result for the September quarter giving New Zealand an annual rate of 2.2 per cent--the lowest in 28 years--has elated the . . . National Government and animated the financial markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        New Zealand now had the second lowest inflation rate for OECD countries, just above Denmark at 2.1 per cent, and wholesale interest rates were among the lowest.
       </para>
       <para>
        They were the words of Finance Minister Ruth Richardson. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Acting Prime Minister Don McKinnon said it was "convincing proof" the Government's economic policies were working.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, with 2.2 per cent inflation and the lowest wholesale interest rates. The report goes on to state:
       </para>
       <para>
        The 2.2 per cent annual rate gave New Zealand a competitive edge on its major trading partners such as Australia . . . , Japan . . . , the United States . . . and Britain . . .  Financial markets reacted immediately today to the Statistics Department's release of the September quarter consumer price index showing a rise of 0.4 per cent on the June quarter. It followed CPI rises for the 1991 June quarter of 0.1 per cent (annual 2.8 per cent) and 0.6 in the 1991 March quarter (annual 4.5 per cent).
       </para>
       <para>
        Reflecting annual inflation of 2.2 per cent--the lowest since 1.9 per cent was recorded in the year to September 1963--it had fallen well below the Reserve Bank's indicative range of 2.5-4.5 per cent set for the end of this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the policy of tax reform is working.

         —-And the Irish?  The figures as they are set out and provided by the OECD relating to the time both before the GST was introduced in New Zealand and subsequently prove the point which has been made time and again by the Opposition that indeed any inflationary effect incurred by the introduction of a goods and services tax is washed out in four quarters. In other words, the effect was that interest rates were high prior to the introduction of the goods and services tax, that there was a one-off shock and at the end of four quarters it was washed out to less than the inflation rate that was being experienced prior to the introduction of the taxation reform.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the December quarter of 1987--and the GST was introduced in New Zealand on 1 October 1986--inflation fell to 9.7 per cent, having been 11.1 per cent immediately prior to the introduction of GST. It has fallen every quarter since then, until now it is down to 2.2 per cent. The experience is the same in Canada, although it has been introduced in a lesser time. Again, it was a one-off shock that was washed out in four quarters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence is there for the Treasurer to see. But the way he dealt with the material in his speech leads me to believe that he does not understand the way those figures ought to be read. Further in his speech he says that our policy approach is unfair, narrow and regressive. In another part of his speech he goes on to say that we do not have a policy. Then he contradicts himself further by saying that we are recycling policies. Clearly, he does seem to be the three wise monkeys all rolled into one and attempts to neither see, speak nor hear evil. The fact of the matter is that he is totally confused. He thinks that we have no policy, that we are recycling policy or that we have an unfair policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is that our reform policies in the taxation area are designed to bring about a logical and equitable tax system, to bring down the dependency that we have on direct taxation and to ensure that the wholesale sales tax--the Government's GST, the Government's secret tax--is abolished in all its unfairness, illogical requirements and the way it falls as a burden upon exports. It is designed, along with industrial relations reform and true micro-economic reform--not just talking about it, but actually doing--to see a change in the direction that Australia will take. In his speech, Mr Kerin says:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is talk of the recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next paragraph says that we have to understand that it was not really all our fault. But Mr Keating, when he was Treasurer, told us that this was the recession that we had to have and that it was tailor-made by this Government. Mr Kerin might want to be Pontius Pilate and wash his hands of it, but I am afraid that is not possible. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        In hindsight, the world's reaction to the 1987 stock market crash was too much.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not the Government's fault; it was the world that did it. Our response, of course, was the Labor Government's response. The Labor Government's response put us into recession ahead of the rest of the world. He says of the Labor Party Government:
       </para>
       <para>
        We swapped a tight fiscal policy for what could be seen, with hindsight, as a too soft monetary policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The then Treasurer, Mr Keating, kept telling us that we were going to have a soft landing. He kept telling us not to worry, and many people did not. That was quite in line with the practice that he had indulged in before when the then Premier of New South Wales was going to an election. To accommodate that election, the Treasurer brought down interest rates for a short time whereby he thought he would be assisting the Premier to get re-elected. He failed, and Australia paid the price. Mr Kerin says:
       </para>
       <para>
        State governments now come to us for funds for redundancy programs as they straighten out their public infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is certainly true of Victoria, and the Labor States are the ones that are in a mess. It is the Labor States where the economy is in the worst recession. Mr Kerin should not try to cover it up by saying that policies which are out of the Liberal stable are tainted with the same infamy as those out of the Labor Party. Then he goes on to say of the Labor Party:
       </para>
       <para>
        We are the ones who have taken the hard decisions in welfare reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet earlier in his speech, Mr Kerin was at great pains to criticise Dr Hewson for his plain speaking about the attitude that we have to welfare, which is to target it, so that the people who really have the need receive it and that it is not spread out amongst those who do not require it, but find it a nice comfortable cushion as well. Targeting of welfare is an important policy. In the same speech, Mr Kerin wants to have it both ways. He wants to say that we are the hard-hearted ones, but he wants to claim the credit for having made the hard decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of investment, Mr Kerin says very confidently:
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that we will get continuing investment in the mining sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        Do we? There are many projects which are held up because of the deals that the Labor Party did with the Greens. There are many deals that would go ahead that Australia would prosper from, but they are impeded by the political will of the incumbent Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, of course, we come to the question of tax again. Mr Kerin says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that there is a tax on investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        He says that he does not quite know what it means; I believe him. I believe him when he says that he does not quite know what it means because his entire speech shows that he does not quite understand what the portfolio is all about. The fact of the matter is that Senator Button understands more. He wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and said that our tax system was an impediment. After questions here from people on this side of the House, Senator Button went all coy and would not tell us what he meant. But we get a clue from a speech that was made by Dr Bell, who is a Deputy Secretary in the Minister's Department. Being an honest, toiling public servant, Dr Bell gave an address to a particular conference. This was reported in the press, and I directed some questions about this address to Dr Bell and Senator Button during the Estimates hearings. I asked whether I could have a copy of the speech. In the speech, Dr Bell actually said that we needed a consumption tax; he said that we needed tax reform. Although this is not the full text of the speech given, because I am told in the accompanying note that this is an outline of the speech that Dr Bell gave, I would like to quote what I think are two very important paragraphs. I am sure it is in agreement with the letter that Senator Button has written to the Prime Minister. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Many elements of the micro-economic reform program are relevant
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . need to consider a technology policy from this viewpoint.
       </para>
       <para>
        Time permits me to address only one of these issues today.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, micro-economic reform. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian exporters are significantly disadvantaged by our indirect taxes. GATT countries with value-added taxes are able to rebate these to exporters. In these countries, value-added tax is usually the major indirect tax. In Australia, recent federal fiscal restraint has forced our States to levy a variety of indirect taxes.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        DITAC calculations suggest that our current tax regime puts Australian exporters at a 5% (average) disadvantage vis-a-vis their international competitors. Five per cent may not sound much, but when transport costs on the costs of capital are taken into account the balance is often tipped against major new technology-based projects going ahead in Australia. Micro-economic factors can play a significant role in inhibiting economic growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, Dr Bell is quite right. He frequently says in this outline of the speech that he gave that we require changes in our taxation system; it requires a competitive tax regime.
       </para>
       <para>
        Going back to Mr Kerin, he says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition does not have one skerrick of alternative policy. We have not seen one detail of its policies and nothing has been said about the future of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said he wanted to be the three wise monkeys rolled into one, and obviously his favourite is to hear nothing. Quite clearly, the Opposition has spelt out its aim and vision for Australia: to restore the standard of living that this Government has seen go into decline; to see that we have the important tax reform; to see that we have a lowering of marginal rates of tax so that we lessen the dependency that we have on direct taxation which comes out of the taxpayers' pocket at source, so the taxpayer will have some discretion about the way in which he contributes to the taxation system via an indirect goods and services tax which would replace that hidden government tax--the wholesales sales tax; and to see that we put in place and announce a compensation package for those people who cannot benefit from the reformed tax system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to Mr Kerin and to all members of the Government that not only have we spelt out in great detail very many of our policies, such as industrial relations reform, but also in the area of dealing with the question of taxation reform there are three important elements to come. But as I have explained, we needed to find the data that was necessary in order to get the sums right. We could not possibly have relied on the Government's 1990-91 Budget because, very simply, our figures would have been out to the same degree that the Government's were. So we had to wait until we got the actual figures for 1990-91 before we had any reliable raw data with which to deal. Soon, in the period ahead, we will have three additional pieces of information--the rate of tax, the size of the tax cuts and the shape of the compensation package--which will fit neatly with the outline and express detail of the way in which tax reform will work under a coalition government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to raise one more matter--a matter that was raised in this House today. During the adjournment debate last night, Senator Colston gave a ruling that I was not able to use the word `misled' in connection with my statement that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) had misled the Senate. I have to take issue with Senator Colston's explanation. Senator Colston said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it is important that any example of unparliamentary language be considered in its context.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree with that and that is exactly what this statement does not do. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        While I accept Senator Hill's point that the word `misled' is not itself unparliamentary, I draw attention to the context in which Senator Bishop used the word.
       </para>
       <para>
        He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        She had indicated that the Minister had "quite deliberately set up a question from Senator Crowley with the direct objective of maligning Robe River Mining". She then went on to say that she had taken a point of order at the time Senator Cook rose to answer the question, as to whether the Minister was speaking as a Minister of the Crown or as a paid up union employee. In that context, therefore, I considered that Senator Bishop's use of the word "misled" implied deliberate misleading.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is where I must take issue with the statement. I refer to pages 1964 and 1965 of last night's Hansard. I set out very clearly in the first part of my speech the fact that Senator Cook had indeed set up a question to be asked by Senator Crowley for the specific purpose of putting material on the record that would malign Robe River Mining. He did not answer the question off the top of his head; he did it with a briefing note and with his notes clearly in front of him--it was planned and quite deliberate. That is where I will use the word `deliberate'.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I then went on to talk about the attempts that the Government had made to get rid of the legislation concerning secondary boycotts. I went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It was interesting that, in asking questions, Senator Crane--
       </para>
       <para>
        whose question I had also referred to at the beginning of the speech--
       </para>
       <para>
        gave Senator Cook the opportunity to correct his record. Senator Crane spoke in the Thursday lunchtime debate and outlined where Senator Cook had misled the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, my statement relating to the misleading of the Senate related to the speech which Senator Crane had given in the Senate and was simply a recital of the facts. The Deputy President, in his quaint terms, said he `counselled' me. The Hansard shows that he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Order!  It is not proper to impute an improper motive of misleading the Senate, Senator Bishop. You might be able to say it slightly differently.
       </para>
       <para>
        I went on to say that I was proceeding to show, as a matter of fact, that the Minister had misled the Senate. Senator Bolkus then intervened and asked that the ruling be upheld. The Deputy President again said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not proper to accuse a Minister of misleading the Senate. Senator Bishop, you may wish to say that he may have misled the Senate or inadvertently misled the Senate, but I will not permit you to say that a Minister misled the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, I would not have any idea whether it was inadvertent or otherwise. I could not possibly say that. I went on to explain the difficulty that such a ruling would make working in this Parliament impossible. In his statement, Senator Colston dismissed what took place with the following:
       </para>

        After some cross-chamber discussion, I suggested that Senator Bishop continue her speech.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I heard your ruling, Mr Deputy President, but I heard you rule that I may not say that the motives of the Minister were improper. The motives and the statement I made about the misleading stand apart. One can mislead the Senate without improper motives or with improper motives. As I understand your ruling, you said I may not say he misled the Senate with improper motives. Perhaps I can deal with the misleading on the basis of not commenting on whether or not his motives were proper or improper.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, at no stage did my statement that Senator Cook had misled the Parliament relate to his motives. It was simply retailing a statement of fact. I then went on to say where he had made the error.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason I have chosen to raise this matter at this stage is that if I let Senator Colston's statement remain unchallenged, I would be acquiescing in a conclusion that I had somehow insinuated or implied `deliberate misleading'--to quote the statement--and I am afraid, on the facts, that that is not borne out. Therefore, I must correct the record.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I must say that since the Budget was brought down, the Government has indulged in antics in response to very adverse criticism. We have seen nothing which shows that the Government is, in any way, shape or form, in command of the direction of the economy. It is in no way in command of setting policy initiatives which will allow this country to survive with its standard of living intact.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very simply, the reforms that the coalition has outlined in much detail--industrial relations reform, taxation reform and micro-economic reform--mean that people, when they go to the polls, will have something to vote upon which will give them hope that we can indeed turn this economy around. It can no longer be left in the hands of those opposite--particularly in the hands of a Treasurer who clearly does not understand the direction that the economy is taking or the part that he could play which might lead to a better path.

Why would Senator Bishop want to say that I am a pawn of Senator Cook's, without my concluding that she was at least of a negative mode?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To say this is not a kindness; it is actually to impute motive and intent to people. Indeed, it goes immediately to the heart of what the Deputy President ruled that Senator Bishop was guilty of. Senator Bishop stood up in here and said, `I wish to dispute that ruling because I never at any stage wanted to impute motive to people' and then clearly said that I am a pawn of Senator Cook's. I suggest it is not drawing a long bow at all to say that she was deliberately trying to impute bad motives to people, and generously included all sorts of folk in her imputation of motives.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer Senator Bishop to the standing order--I cannot be sure of its number because we have had an updating of the Standing Orders and new numbering--which says that whether you say `misleading' or not, you may not impute motive to people. Senator Bishop is beginning to polish this imputation of motive to an art form. She is very good at suggesting that everybody else is doing things, and she can even tell them why they are doing them. She has just done an extraordinary hatchet job of imputation of motive to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin). She knows, apparently, what he thinks. I have to say that it does not do Senator Bishop any good at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I were to get back into the chess mode with respect to Senator Bishop referring to me as Senator Cook's pawn, I would remember that the bishop on the chess board, by and large, does her killing on the diagonal, and that is a pretty devious way to approach things. It is not honourable of Senator Bishop to lag off me en passant last night--with no mention or reference notifying me. For the record, I wonder whether Senator Bishop actually informed Senator Colston that she was going to stand up and say those things or should he, inadvertently, have to find them out? That is not graceful.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bishop asks me to believe that the Opposition has the tax package which will change the face of Australia. I refer again to the Budget documents and some other comments of Senator Bishop's. The comments were along the lines of, `I know what is best', which is probably an even wilder claim than imputing motive to people. She told us that the Opposition's tax policy--which we all know about, except the details of it--will be the salvation of this country. That is best refuted by a little poem which has the line, `Oh let us never doubt what nobody is sure about'. Senator Bishop seems to be absolutely sure about something of which we have no detail, and she is not going to give us any detail either.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bishop has said some fairly fierce things about the wholesale sales tax, suggesting that it is tax by stealth and other comments of that ilk. She has not told us that one of the facts about the wholesale sales tax is that it is a very administratively efficient tax and that it would be collected at a much lower cost than the goods and services tax. That is not put on the board. If we are telling the truth, let us tell the whole truth, otherwise let us say, `You are not going to tell us yet what you are going to do with the goods and services tax, so it is really very peculiar that we should be debating it'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also interesting that Senator Bishop mentioned New Zealand and the fact that the inflation rate is down there. Senator Bishop should tell us about employment; tell us about how much people are getting if they are on welfare; tell us about how much trouble pensioners are now in because their payments are so much less; and tell us, too, what the Opposition is planning to cut in terms of government expenditure under its policy proposals. It is dangerous of Senator Bishop to urge us to take note of how the Opposition's policies will save this country when, by and large, they are still unknown, not detailed or finalised, and certainly not available to the Australian community to have a long, hard look at.  There is much that could be said about Senator Bishop's contribution and probably it is best that we bypass it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to comment on the changes in the Budget that go to the needs of families, and low income families, particularly the increase in the family allowance supplement. I believe that my colleague Senator Burns mentioned this and perhaps others did too. It is a payment of such importance that I have to comment on it now. It is very important for people in the community, particularly low income families, to know what assistance the Government will provide for them, not only during tough times but also at any other time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been interested to see the effort with which this Government has tried to make those rights, services and facilities available to people, together with information about them, so that people will be able to exercise their options to take up those facilities and provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that the Opposition in this place has, on occasion, accused the Government of the wilful wasting of dollars when, for example, it has spent money on advertising social security benefits. The Opposition has wanted to pour scorn on the Government for informing people of the provisions that are available to assist them. I would have thought that if members of the Opposition had actually talked to the recipients of the family allowance supplement they would know just what help it has been to low income families and pensioners. It is a wonderful payment which covers people moving from a pension into the work force--it is designed to counter the poverty trap that people are caught in as they move off pensions into the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a payment that has been well taken up, and it is important that people notice the changes. The income test for those in receipt of maximum benefits under the family allowance supplement will be increased from $18,000 to $19,300. This will raise the income threshold for the maximum benefit to align it with the indexed Austudy threshold. This means that a family with two children, earning $20,000 a year, will be eligible for family assistance payments up to $97 a week free of tax--an increase of up to $12.50 per week. For people in that income range, that increase will be of great assistance. Most importantly, I hope that families who will be eligible will know that they are eligible, and will not forget to inquire about their access to that assistance from the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other changes in terms of payments for families will be administered differently. It is proposed that they will all be paid as one payment to the carer of children--usually the mother. We also know--the facts have not changed at all but are continually confirmed--that the mother, when getting that money for her children, in large part spends it on the children compared to what has occurred in the past when payments to the family or to the father were, invariably, not spent on the children.  The targeting of the payment to the mother ensures that the benefits for the children will get through to the children. It is important to stress that in relation to this Budget because of the increased payments which will be made to families on low incomes which will provide very important assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Budget also provides increased opportunities for training and education. I have heard my Opposition colleagues in this place seek to make mincemeat of the Government for providing education and training opportunities. Opposition members have tried to suggest that such action is in lieu of unemployment benefits. Even if that criticism were true, I believe that it is an acceptable comment. If this Government has focused people's minds on training and education rather than on their being unemployed, surely that in itself is a huge benefit. In particular, it is important that we stress the benefits of training and education, and not just look at short term actions in terms of unemployment benefits. Certainly, we should look at the longer term. We know from all the studies that people who are better trained and who have any kind of tertiary training, skill or education have better opportunities for employment, and once in employment access to better paid jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The importance of these factors cannot be overlooked. Since assuming office this Government has increased higher education places by around 100,000--from 250,000 in 1983 to 350,000 in 1991. There will be further increases in 1992, particularly to address the number of youngsters who are now leaving school and wanting to go on to tertiary education. In some ways we are now facing the further demand on outlays that comes from the success of this Government's encouragement for young people to stay in school through to year 12. The figure of 30 per cent relating to such people when we came into office has now risen to 60 per cent for all States, except in the Australian Capital Territory where I think the figure is in the region of 80 per cent. In other words, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of young people staying to year 12. Consequently, there will be a significant increase in the demand on tertiary training places, whether in terms of universities, colleges or TAFE courses around the country. The Government has allocated extra money in this Budget to deal with that increased demand. I think that it is a matter of real celebration that so many Australians want to proceed to further education. We should be encouraging that education, its range, diversity and quality rather than carping about whether it is in lieu of unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to say a few words about the increasing impetus of the science and technology part of the Budget. A number of cooperative research centres have now been established;  indeed, a total of 45 or so will be established over a three-year period. I understand that 15 or so were established last year and are beginning to become fully functional. Cooperation between the educational institutions, research institutions and industry is beginning to happen. I think that in the short term we will see a considerable return to Australia on this investment in science and technology and the industrialisation of research and development.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must not underestimate how wonderful this country's research achievements have been. We should be extremely proud of Australia's history in research. Our capacity to turn our research skills and talents into export dollars for this country falls short of the record of research itself. However, I am delighted to see the continued impetus and dollar commitment to the promotion of that kind of return through investment in our research, as well as university investment in the intelligence and capacities of our researchers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the programs are aimed particularly at encouraging young people, girls as well as boys, into the study of science and technology at school so that they can develop those areas in their university lives. These areas are still underdeveloped, and I look forward to the prospects brought about by those changes in the next five to 10 years. I shall also be interested to keep a close eye on the outcome of the new investment in science and technology. I would hate to think that our research was confined only to the industrial development of science and technology. I strongly support this Government's initiatives in insisting on research as much into arts and cultural matters as into the scientific disciplines. There is much that is interesting and exciting in this Budget. It is a great pity to have to listen to negative comments such as those made by Senator Bishop. Therefore, I am pleased to put my comments on the record.

         —-I rise to speak tonight in the debate on the Appropriation Bills as shadow Minister responsible for three separate portfolio areas, namely, defence, science and personnel, veterans' affairs and the status of women. In the brief time that is available tonight, I want to raise issues of importance in each of those three portfolio areas and especially matters of great concern to me.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Firstly, I turn to the budget for the Department of Defence. This year the Defence budget has been dominated by the results of the force structure review which were announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in May. As a result of that statement, we are now facing the replacement of regular units by the Ready Reserve. This is probably the most momentous decision that this Government has made in terms of Australia's long term future. That statement will have a lasting effect on the defence of Australia. We now see the results in this Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say that it is a momentous decision because I fear that we are now on the first step of a route that will take us down the track that Australia took leading into the middle and late 1930s. By the time we were facing a second world war, we had a cadre force which was barely professional, severely depleted, had a very low morale and was having great difficulty in trying to raise and train a defence force to fight for Australia. I say that very advisedly and carefully because, when the Minister announced that there would be an abolition of regular units to be replaced by ready reserve units, he foreshadowed that there would be a review of that decision in a couple of years. That review would be with a view to seeing what other regular units could be translated into ready reserve units. I very much fear that this is just the first step in a long term plan to reduce us once again to a cadre defence force.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government believes that we are now in a time of peace and that this is all leading up to some marvellous peace dividend, the Government is living in cloud-cuckoo-land. With the retreat, if you like, of the super powers from our region, small powers see opportunities for their own aggrandisement, for their own future empires and for power.
       </para>
       <para>
        Countries in our region are believed to have nuclear capabilities, some countries are spending considerable money on arming their defence forces, while others are narrowing the technological gap between themselves and us. I do not want to be considered to be a warmonger, but it is in Australia's interests that that technological edge is maintained. It is in Australia's interests not only that we maintain a technological edge but also that we maintain a highly qualified defence force which is able to defend Australia with the new technology.
       </para>
       <para>
        If anything was learnt from the Gulf war, it is that technology is wonderful if a country wants to win a war but, in order to make that technology work, it must have highly trained, very experienced, professional people. I fear that one outcome of the force structure review will be diminished experience levels, morale and numbers in our defence force. Numbers are not the be-all and end-all. We no longer need hundreds of thousands of people to fight with hundreds of thousands of people. But a rule of thumb that does not seem to be out of fashion is that 3 : 1 is a good ratio for ensuring that a country has the numbers to defend itself. However, I am not looking at questions of numbers but at the quality of the force that is needed to defend this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        On Sunday, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, told the Australian Defence Association in Melbourne in my presence that the outcome of the force structure review will be a better defence effort. If ever there was a fatuous statement and one destined and designed, one presumes, to mislead, it was that. Certainly the Minister's statement would have misled any other audience, but those present were people who are extremely concerned and interested in defence, and they were not misled by it.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the real position? Let us just ask ourselves five questions to test the Minister's statement and the enormity of the decisions that are taken. I do not want to go into the details of the force structure review tonight; that is not my purpose. I did that when the Minister made his statement in May and I have been doing it around the country since. The Minister said that the outcome of the force structure review will be a better defence effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        A question we have to ask ourselves is: has the force structure review improved our readiness and our ability to quickly get away to defend our country or our interests? Clearly, the answer to that question has to be no. When two out of the only six regular battalions which this country possesses are removed, the ability of a professional, highly trained force to get away quickly to defend our national interests is diminished by one-third. There is no doubt that we are trying to replace those two regular battalions with manpower that has had one year's professional training--I acknowledge that it will be professional training--and then part time soldiering 50 days a year for four years thereafter, which is useful and valuable but in no way can be equated to somebody training for the entire year. After the four years, the value of that training quickly diminishes. So their readiness must be compromised.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we look at putting a force in the field, we look to see how long we can keep it there, how quickly we have to replace it and how soon it gets tired and needs reinforcing. We usually work on the basis that, for every battalion that is given a job to do, an army needs three battalions--one coming into the front to fight, one retiring from the front and one resting and getting ready to go in again. When we had six battalions, that was possible. It meant that we could deploy two battalions. By removing two of the six, we are now in a position where we could really only deploy one battalion in a sustainable fashion. There is just no getting away from that basic military rule. We have reduced the sustainability of our fight.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next question one asks is: has the force structure review improved our technology?  One might be tempted to say yes. After all, these cuts in the Defence budget and the changes being made are being made because the capital equipment procurement program has so blown out the budget that personnel, training and operating costs have had to be squeezed. So, in one sense, we could say yes, this will be to the benefit of the technology; of course that is important.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in another sense, it is not to the benefit of technology because we will have this enormous bulge caused by the Collins class submarines and the Anzac frigates all going through the Defence budget during the same decade and pushing out of the way other projects that are of great importance to Australia's defence. By other projects, I am thinking of the airborne and early warning aircraft, mine countermeasures and perhaps a helicopter support ship in order for us to deploy forces where airfields, et cetera, are perhaps occupied around our coastline. It may be a question of saving the Cocos (Keeling) Islands or Christmas Island; it may be the need some day to deploy off the coast of Papua New Guinea to help our neighbour; or it may be to save some of our nationals in islands in the Pacific. Whatever it is, those and other items of technology are denied to us because of the mishandling, until now, of the Defence budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        We ask ourselves: has the force structure review improved leadership in the Defence Force?  I say sadly that in the long term it will not. I also believe it will have a deleterious effect on leadership. There is an increasing emphasis on the need for Defence Force officers to be good managers, and that is right and proper. Particularly in peace time, there is a need for management of great budgets and management of great resources. But defending a country is not all about management; it is also about leadership. In war time, the leadership role takes prominence.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we expect ever to need to commit forces to defend this county or our national interests, we need leaders of people. I fear that, by cutting out a substantial proportion of the officers and senior NCOs, particularly in our Army, down the track those people will no longer be around. They will not have had the experience at middle ranking or more junior levels. They will not be around when government may need very experienced and highly trained personnel. They will not be around to give the sort of advice that governments need in a time of emergency. They will not be around to lead a force. We could all be the poorer in every respect for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final question we should ask is:  has the force structure review improved morale in our Force?  The answer, sadly, whether we are talking about the Regular Force or the existing Reserve Force, is no. The existing Reserve Force will feel very much the Cinderella of the defence forces of Australia. It is already underequipped. Last year, there were insufficient man days for the jobs, the roles, it had been given, yet we find in this year's Budget that cuts of 5.8 per cent have been made in man days for training the existing Reserve. Clearly, that money has been put aside to contribute towards the enormous cost to the budget of the Ready Reserve. It will be very clear to existing reservists who may even be working in civilian employment, side by side with a ready reservist, that the Ready Reserve has come into being at the expense of the existing reserves who have served this country long and loyally--those who already have a full time job and give up some of the time that they would otherwise spend with their family or on their personal interests to make sure that this country has a better chance to survive in times of war. The existing reserves can see very well what is happening to the limited resources that are available--and they are not going to get them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The regulars are concerned about the future of their careers in a full time regular professional force. At the moment, they are economic conscripts because, with high unemployment, they do not see a great deal of future in getting out of the Defence Force to go to `civvy street'. Even now, it is interesting to see how many are still leaving the Defence Force, notwithstanding that we are facing times of high unemployment. There is a great correlation between the unemployment rates and the wastage rates from the forces. In good and bad times, we can see pretty clear correlations. Nevertheless, the resignations from the forces are still too high--surprisingly so when one considers the employment situation outside. On all these tests, the Government's changes to the defence of Australia will have a serious and long term effect, about which we should be very concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the limited time I have tonight I wish to speak about the two other portfolio areas for which I have responsibility. I want to deal quickly with two issues of importance in the veterans' portfolio. First, the Government talks very carefully about the integration of repatriation hospitals. It all sounds nice and clean and clinical and as though it could not hurt anybody. What we should be talking about is the hand over of the hospitals, the welshing on the veterans and the failure to keep bargains with the veterans.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both in this place and outside, over many months, I have been quoting the promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) over three years that veterans will not be disadvantaged by the handing over of their repatriation hospital system to the State systems. The veterans know what is happening week by week in States around Australia: hospital systems are crumbling and are in chaos. Veterans are being forced out, shunted out, of their repatriation hospitals to join the queues in the public hospital systems of the States of Australia. I remind the Parliament of what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs said in Parliament in November 1988:
       </para>
       <para>
        The integration of the repatriation hospital systems will not take place until all of the concerns of the veterans' community are dealt with. That is an unequivocal guarantee. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot have it much clearer than that. The Prime Minister has made that promise in similar terms. Yet the Government is continuing to rush like a bulldozer down the track to hand over these hospitals while the veterans' organisations still have unsatisfied questions waiting to be answered. They are still not convinced that they will have any sort of priority of access in the hospital system that is being offered to them. They have no confidence that the quality of care to which they have been accustomed--and which has been theirs as of right as compensation for their war service--will remain after this Government hands over their hospitals.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Estimates Committee we heard that the Government has spent $358,906.81 on trying to persuade the veterans that the hand over is in their interests. If it really were in their interests, one would think that it would be very easy to tell the veterans and that they would start queuing for a new and better system. But this Government has had to spend money on mailing house costs, direct mail to veterans, and direct mail to local medical officers and specialists. The Government has sent out all sorts of propaganda leaflets from the States to the veterans organisations. The Government has distributed a brochure full of cartoons which has offended so many veterans and war widows. They have complained to me that they are being treated as stupid children who have had to be convinced of something by the value of cartoons. If ever there were a tasteless, expensive and unacceptable exercise, it is this $358,906.81 spent on trying to convince the veterans that getting rid of their hospitals will be good for them. The Government has failed on that, and unless it is prepared to take careful notice of the veterans' very justifiable concerns it will not get to first base with them. The Government will be shown up for making promises that it had no intention of keeping. Sadly, this Government has developed a tremendous reputation for making promises that it never intended to meet.

        I also want to speak briefly about the failure of the claims system. After all these decades of a repatriation system, we still have a system which is not adequately meeting the needs of veterans. Just recently in the Parliament, the annual report of the Veterans Review Board was presented. The report contained pretty clear evidence of the tremendous waste of taxpayers' funds; of decisions, taken in the first instance by the delegate of the Repatriation Commission, being overturned in alarming numbers when they go on appeal to the Veterans Review Board. One thinks of the great waste of time and money and the stress and strain on older men and women who have fought for their country and the war widows who have lost their husbands through the husband's service to the country. It is long overdue that we develop a claims system which is humane, speedy, caring, non-adversarial and non-legalistic--whatever one would like to say. There are better ways of doing it and it is incredible that all this way down the track we are being so uncaring towards to our veterans and so prepared to waste taxpayers' money.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only today in the Canberra Times there is a report about Mrs Whetton, who has finally achieved war widow status, five years after she was widowed. Her husband was severely injured in the Second World War and he died in 1986. She fought all the way to have her eligibility decided. She finally got a decision by a single judge of the Federal Court. Then, would you believe it, Mr Deputy President, the Repatriation Commission--all heart--appealed against the decision of the Federal Court judge and took her to the Full Court. I am glad to say that Mrs Whetton had the guts and the determination to persevere and she won in the Full Court.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not the sort of repatriation system that Australians should be proud of. The benefits are not bad by comparison with world standards, but the system is wretched. Too many people are put through this test. What worries me more than anything is the number of veterans who, unfortunately, have not claimed for their entitlements to compensation for their war service in all the years since the Second World War. Now they are perhaps in their seventies and are saying that they need some help. So they ask for a determination and are knocked back. Many of those people refuse to appeal.
       </para>
       <para>
        We know from the Veterans' Review Board report that veterans have at least a 50 per cent chance of winning an appeal. Veterans in Western Australia have about a 70 per cent chance and those in Queensland a 60 per cent chance. Clearly, they have a very good chance of winning if they go on to appeal, but they are so disgusted and so hurt by the rejection that they do not appeal. I feel very sad that this country can preside over such a system. It is time that something was urgently done to help our veterans and war widows.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to speak in the minutes remaining on a couple of issues relating to the status of women. First, I want to raise the question of access to mammography for all Australian women, including those in the country. We have too many deaths in this country of women who have not had breast cancer detected early. Many hundreds of cases each year, something like 370, could be prevented with early detection.
       </para>
       <para>
        For three years before the last election, the Government had in place a pilot mammography screening program in most, but not all, States--there was no program in Tasmania, for example. When it came to the election, the Opposition said that it would have a national screening program. In came big mouth, the Prime Minister, promising that he would spend $64m over the first three years of a five-year program to introduce a national screening program for breast cancer.
       </para>
       <para>
        In last year's Women's Budget Statement for 1990-91, the Government allocated a sum of $20m for expenditure in the first year. What do we find now? We find in this year's Women's Budget Statement that the Government actually spent $1m. It is now 18 months since the Prime Minister made his promise and $1m has actually been spent. This coming year, $18.7m has been allocated in the Women's Budget Statement. One wonders just how much is going to be spent this year to save women's lives in this country. Are women's lives expendable?  If the Prime Minister's wife had breast cancer, I wonder how much more urgent he might have considered a program which seemed so desirable to him at election time, but which was so quickly put on the back-burner.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am intrigued also by the wording in the Women's Budget Statement this year when referring to the national program for the early detection of breast cancer. It is really rather coy. It says that some $1m was provided for the program in 1990-91 and that $18.7m has been allocated for 1991-92. Of course, it is not true to say that $1m was provided for the program in 1990-91. In fact, $20m was provided for the program, of which only $1m was spent. So much for the honesty of the Women's Budget Statement which I notice blew out from an already overblown document last year of 240 pages to a 414-page document this year. I think that must take the cake as one of the most overblown pufferies that the Government has been able to produce at Budget time.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not by the number of pages in the Women's Budget Statement that women in Australia will judge this Government. They will judge this Government by the services it provides, the care it gives to its citizens, the promises that it keeps or it breaks and the economy that it heals. It is judged already for the economy that it has left in such a mess. What will it do to try to right that wrong done to all the people in Australia?
       </para>
       <para>
        The final issue I raise tonight that is of concern to women is the question of the Telecom 0055 telephone numbers. This Government has made much of its concern about the portrayal of women in advertising and the media. Many women in Australia find a lot of the advertising sexist and offensive. In many respects, I sympathise with the view. But if I were to set a priority for giving governmental attention to the portrayal of women in this country, it would be the portrayal of women in pornography and the growing, burgeoning industry which is degrading women of Australia, affecting the innocence of our children, changing the culture of our society, silencing, if you like, the good families of Australia who are being made to feel that there is something not very smart about complaining about pornography wherever they find it. They are being cowed into silence.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is developing an acceptance of pornography, yet many people find it abhorrent. Parents worry about the long term desensitising effect pornography will have on their children, yet this Government lifts not a finger. Indeed, it takes money from it. This Government is indirectly achieving many millions of dollars in revenue from Telecom 0055 numbers.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you will know, Mr Deputy President, this is an issue I have been pursuing for well over a year now. Today I received an answer from Senator Collins representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley. I asked questions about Telecom's new contractual agreement with service providers of the recorded telephone messages. That new agreement was supposed to have been effective for two weeks from 1 October.
       </para>
       <para>
        I asked whether the Minister would confirm that adult messages previously available under the 0055 prefix had been moved to 0051 with limited access using a personal identification number. I also asked, if the answer was yes, how many of those messages had been moved to 0051 and if the answer was no, why was there a delay. I also asked a number of other questions. The Minister's answer was not at all specific. Part of his answer said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised by Telecom that, as the new arrangements are still in the process of being implemented fully, it is still unclear how many of the services currently on 0055 will need to be transferred to the new 0051 service.
       </para>
       <para>
        I asked how many had been transferred. He did not address himself to that. Clearly, they have not been moved across. That is the information that was made available to me. I want to know why not. For the last several months we were told that on 1 October they would be transferred. What we find is that these adult messages to go to 0051 are not going to be transferred across by Telecom but only by the service providers and also that Telecom is not going to monitor the content and advertising of any messages until a complaint is raised by a member of the public.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister ends his answer by saying that he is currently awaiting advice from Telecom concerning implementation of the procedures. I say that he and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Ms Fatin, should have been out on the hustings insisting that a lead be shown by this Government, that Telecom remove these offensive services from the telephone lines of Australia. But this is the Government which has no policies, no morals, no standards, no ability to manage the economy, and cares not a jot or a whit for the people of this country. It deserves condemnation on every score and it will get that at the next election. (Time expired)

         —-I want to reflect upon the stage we have reached after eight years of this Government. It is not unreasonable to ask: does this Government have a proud record of achievement? Can this Government stand on its record? Can this Government be satisfied with the rewards and results of its endeavours? Can the Government tell the average Australian, `You are better off than you were when we were elected in 1983'? Of course, the answer is no.

        After eight years as Treasurer of this country, Mr Paul Keating has the audacity to say that this Government ought to refocus its policies to take account of unemployment. Of course, we know that it was eight years of hard Labor--eight years of his endeavour--that gave us one million unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not as if Australia was afflicted with an unfair fate. It was not as if a circumstance was visited upon us by the rest of the world. It was not as if some aberration has caused us to have one million unemployed. It is the direct and absolute manifestation of this Government's policies that we now have approximately 1.3 million people unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The great tragedy of this recession, which is going to be ever so difficult to escape from, is that it has touched parts of the work force that to some degree have previously been insulated. I refer, for instance, to the middle management white collar workers whose only skill, whose only qualification, is the experience that they are able to offer. If they are retrenched, they do not have the appropriate qualifications that are needed to obtain another job. Their skills are the years of service that they have given to the company for which they worked and which has had to take down its shingle. The 55-year-olds with two or three children at school, who are paying off their mortgage and who probably will not in their working lifetime be able to get another job, are the sorts of people who have been cast onto the unemployment scrap heap by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The level of unemployment is the result of deliberate decisions taken by the Government. A decision was made to induce the recession because of the failure of manifest policies. Decisions have been made from day one--the first in 1983-84 to blow out the Budget deficit to allow government sector borrowings to rise by 5.7 per cent. What was Mr Keating's comment?  All we got was, `Prepare to hoist full sails for strong growth and recovery'. Of course, that is what we got--but strong growth at any price, without any structural reform in place to be able to absorb the growth that was taking place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Between 1983 and 1988 private sector credit increased by over 20 per cent. In due course, the Government woke up to the fact that the level of growth could not in any way be sustained; that it was causing enormous imbalances in our current account; that it was piling up foreign debt; that it was driving up inflation; and that there would be cyclical unemployment. Those signals finally were seen by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        But what did the Government do? Immediately prior to the 1987 Federal election, when it looked like being ignominiously dumped from office, the Government jammed down interest rates 6 percentage points. It took this action simply to save itself. That was at a time of already strong demand, which was not even interrupted by the share market crash of 1987. Australia paid a terrible price for rescuing the Government from almost certain defeat.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then the money supply was let out again. Interest rates were allowed to come down as a result of the forlorn hope of this Government of saving its mates in the New South Wales Government. But nothing could save Mr Unsworth. It was only in late May or early June of 1988, notwithstanding the previous advice from Treasury and the Reserve Bank at the beginning of 1988 to do so, that the Government began to tighten monetary policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the truth of the matter is that the Government had no other policies. No other structural change had been put in place to counter the difficulties that we had as a result of such strong growth. Although we could control the price of funds, because of deregulation there was no longer a capacity to use that instrument to control the quantity of funds. And because of galloping, unattended inflation, we had an assets boom.
       </para>
       <para>
        Enormous amounts of foreign investment and funds poured into Australia. This money found its way into central business district properties simply because of high inflation and the tax structure. The cost of interest could be written off against profits. Profits were not taxed until they reached a certain level. There was record inflation. We saw an asset purchase binge. Finally, sustained interest rate increases over a long period ensured that the economy ultimately fell over.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government did absolutely nothing about the problems. We all know the perverse effects that the high interest rates had. They drove the exchange rate up. At a time when local manufacturers were crippled by high interest rates, this increase in the exchange rate made their capacity to export much more difficult and made imports much cheaper. So at a time when the Government was trying to drive down demand, to choke off imports, it was in a perverse way stimulating these activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        While 1.4 million jobs were created between 1983 and 1990, Maximilian Walsh made the obvious observation that the jobs were being created where the economy artificially bubbled. We found a significant increase in employment in the consumption areas, wholesale and retail, the service industries and also in property services and construction--all the non-productive areas. When we look at employment growth in those sectors that create wealth for us, pay for our imports and assist with our foreign debt, we find that employment in the mining sector came down and there was only a very marginal increase in the level of employment in the manufacturing sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        During all this time, while the nominal wage increased by about 6 per cent or 7 per cent because the accords had put a floor under inflation and guaranteed that inflation was unlikely to go below 6 per cent or 7 per cent, the truth of the matter was that the ordinary, average worker suffered a decline in real wages--or had certainly gone through a period of flat wages--all because of the level of inflation. Of course, it is no surprise that Australia's productivity had lagged behind that of the rest of the world, and by 1990 the level of GDP per hour was less than that of 1984 or 1985. The increase in nominal labour costs in Australia was double that of the OECD countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is argued that there had been a slowdown in growth. The truth of the matter is that if we are not comparable with the rest of the world, the level of slowdown is totally irrelevant. Our nominal wage costs increased by 45 per cent between 1984 and 1989 while those for the rest of the OECD countries increased by 20 per cent. In part, that was as a result of the cosy deal between the Government and the ACTU whose prime objective, as best as I can tell, was not the interest of the workers but ensuring that it managed to control labour in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have this bizarre uniform rigidity of wage determination spreading across the industries, where management is unable to make any determinations in respect of its capacity to pay the price of labour, or quality of that labour. Everything is subject to determinations in courts a long way from the workplace. Need we ask why Australia's annual productivity growth averaged but 1.1 per cent over the 10 years to 1990--hardly figures likely to create an environment to ensure that Australia could be competitive with the rest of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of matters such as micro-economic reform I will give the ex-Treasurer credit for one confession:  between 1987 and 1990 the Government missed its opportunity for micro-economic reform. We see very little improvement now, except for Senator Collins puffing and panting about the very marginalised improvements on the waterfront. Of course, we still see two drivers required to drive a crane with one seat and three levers. That sort of mentality still prevails in Australia but, because there have been some percentage increases in productivity, we are supposed to get excited about them. Until such time as our micro-economic reform provides transport, communications and shipping, to name but three, at world best standards, we will not be competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        All this endeavour led ultimately to the levels of bankruptcy that we see in Australia; the 12,991 bankruptcies last year--an increase on the 8,500 the previous year--aggregating to just over 50,000 bankruptcies that have occurred in the life of this Government. We can expect that they will increase. That figure does not include the voluntary liquidations and those businesses that, while surviving, have little more than a nameplate over their businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it any surprise that a recent survey by the Confederation of Australian Industry revealed that 90 per cent of respondents viewed current business opportunities as poor, very poor or depressed?  Perhaps they meant `depressing', but they said `depressed'. Is it any wonder that the same survey found that 90 per cent of respondents saw investment prospects as poor, very poor or very depressed?  In my view, we can expect employment to remain very subdued. For whatever reason not immediately apparent to me, the Government seems optimistic that we will see some growth in employment next year, but given the OECD's prediction for growth in Australia, I would have thought that unemployment will stay very much where it is.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, the results that this Government has achieved have been all its own work. I find it interesting that we now have Senator Button, Mr Kerin, Mr Griffiths and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talking about fast-tracking projects. It begs the question:  what is the intrinsic worth of these projects that requires them to be fast-tracked now, whereas 12 months ago they could not get on the drawing board?  Is there something different about the environment? Is there something different about world markets?

        As I say, with Australia's growth likely to be 1.8 per cent at the most next year alongside the 0.2 per cent this year, one cannot be optimistic for the future. The truth of the matter is that nothing has changed. This Government has done nothing except tighten money supply. The only thing this Government could do to bring the economy under control in the short term was destroy jobs, destroy lives, destroy businesses and destroy life's endeavours. The object of that was simply to throttle import demand. What a cruel price the average Australian has paid because this Government has not been prepared to deal with micro-economic reform. It has not been prepared to deal with deregulating the labour market. It has not been prepared to come to grips with the necessity for privatisation. It has not been prepared to come to grips with creating an environment which makes Australia competitive with the rest of the world. At present, diabolical circumstances are prevailing simply because of an incompetent, failed Government which, in my view, has lost its right to govern.

        It arises from the situation of the Buddhists in Vietnam. I want to refer in part to the answer given by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) in another place yesterday when he was asked this question:

       <para>
        Can the Minister advise the House of recent significant developments in Australia's aid program to Indo-China?

       <para>
        Turning to Vietnam, the Government's decision to resume direct aid restores a very important element in the relationship between Australia and Vietnam. Vietnam is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world and there is a clear need for aid on both developmental and humanitarian grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister referred to the fact that an Australian programming mission will visit Vietnam looking at possible development projects. He also indicated that he himself would visit Vietnam in November to talk to the Government on questions of aid and of trade. He refers to enabling Vietnam to resume normal membership of the International Monetary Fund and says:

        Firstly, we believe that we have a responsibility to this region.

        Secondly, he said that the economic potential of Vietnam and the interest for Australian business are quite significant.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I want to ask the Minister to do when he goes to Vietnam is to extract from the Vietnamese Government an undertaking that it will refrain from continuing to persecute the Buddhists in that country. There is very good reason to believe that that is still continuing. I am not opposing the resumption of aid to Vietnam but I believe that we ought not to resume that aid without requiring that Government to have some regard for human rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were about 20,000 Buddhist monks and nuns in Vietnam in 1975. By the end of 1988 there were about 5,000 or perhaps a few more if one counts those held in gaol without trial. I wish to mention a few cases:  Thich Thien Minh who was killed in 1978 and Thich Tri Thu in 1984 for being critical of the Government; and the Deputy Chairman of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Church National Council, the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang and Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, the General Secretary, who were held without charge from 1982 and one of whom at least was very ill for a period.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United Vietnamese Buddhist Church was formed in 1964 and destroyed by the Communist Government of Vietnam in 1981. I refer also to Thich Duc Nhuan who was imprisoned in 1985 for 15 years; and Thich Tue Sy, a philosopher and writer, together with Thich Tri Sieu, an historian, who were sentenced to death on 30 September 1988. At the time I asked that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and his Department take the matter up. Eventually, as a result of a great deal of activity, those last two sentences were commuted to a period of 20 years imprisonment. There is clear evidence that those people had been deprived of food and medicine and were not well treated while in custody.  Tran Van Luong, a layman, was also sentenced to death in September 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        They were all arrested with other Buddhist scholars in April 1984 and then tortured, tried and, as I said, condemned to death. Many other Buddhists were sent to re-education camps and since 1975 they have either been killed or otherwise confined. Clearly, the communist-led government of Vietnam has tried to stamp out religion. It will not succeed, of course, but at the time a great deal of suffering has been imposed.

        There are monks, nuns, lay leaders, writers and poets in prison, in labour camps, in re-education camps and held without trial with no regard for human rights. These people are religious leaders who have been held as political prisoners and punished because of their desire for democracy and for freedom of religion in their country. The Australian Government should require the Vietnamese Government to implement a policy of tolerance for religious organisations to enable the United Vietnamese Buddhist Church to resume not only its religious activities but also its educational and charity activities; to return to the church its property; and to allow members of overseas Buddhist organisations to visit their colleagues in Vietnam.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that the aid from Australia will be greatly appreciated. The people of Vietnam have been suffering under communist rule for a very long time and they need to be relieved of that. When the Minister says that he is going to Vietnam and is sending a programming mission to Vietnam, top of the list should be our requirement that this sort of torture and repression of the Buddhists must cease, that the people held in prison must be released and that the practice of the religion must be able to continue. That, as far as I am concerned, is a typical question from a member of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that the Government, while acknowledging, as the Minister said, responsibility to the region and while recognising that there is economic potential for Australian business in Vietnam, will not merely pursue the matter on that basis but use the opportunity to achieve something in this area as well. As I said, I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer responds to this debate tonight he will mention this matter. I hope that my remarks will be conveyed to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development as he pursues the matters that he is taking up in Vietnam.

         —-I support all the speakers from this side of the chamber in this debate on Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991-92. I believe I am the last to speak in this debate on behalf of the Opposition. This Budget debate is an absolute indictment of the entire Hawke Government, which includes every member of the Government because they have all played a part in presiding over the worst economic recession that this country has seen since the Great Depression. But what is worse is that it is a deep recession that has been engineered by both the Hawke-Keating Labor Government and the Hawke-Kerin Labor Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have got an economic situation that has been completely paralysed by a lack of direction, incentive and capacity. This Budget, which has just been delivered, is equally lacking in direction, incentive and capacity. In fact, it is just like the Government itself. Once again it has been announced one day and amended the next by the ACTU or some other faction of the Australian Labor Party. Once again we have a Budget that tinkers at the edges but leaves the hard decisions for another time, another day and another government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been called the do nothing, be patient or hang on and hope Budget, although I do not know how long a lot of people will be able to hang on. For the nearly one million Australians on the unemployed scrap heap, there is nothing to hang on to and nothing to hope for. For the young unskilled school leaver, there is no encouragement, no incentive for employers to take on apprentices and, in fact, no jobs and no joy. For the students, more financial obstacles are put in their way, and the higher education contribution scheme is testimony to the inability of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, to tackle structural problems in higher education.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the 60,000 businesses made bankrupt during the life of the Hawke Government there is also no incentive. For those still in business, the impost of the 5 per cent superannuation tax will result in more unemployment and more small business bankruptcy, and is unlikely to improve retirement income security to any degree. For Australian farmers there is less than nothing and not even the weather is giving them a hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should listen to what ABARE says about the fact that the Australian farming and mining industries are in great strife. The Federal Labor Government is doing absolutely nothing to try to address the problem. ABARE forecasts released back in September basically reconfirmed what the Bureau had been saying continuously for the past 12 months. In short, ABARE said that our earnings from agricultural and mineral exports would fall for the first time in 10 years and the incomes of the hard-pressed farmers would decline even more. Farmers are facing a 24 per cent fall in net farm cash income, on top of a decline of 35 per cent in 1990 and 1991. That is a collapse of nearly 60 per cent in average net farm income over two years. We can all ask ourselves: would any PAYE worker accept a cut in his or her wages of 60 per cent over two years? I think that we can all give the answer to that: we would definitely not expect them to, nor would we want them to. But that is what has happened to the farmers. That is what has happened to the people out there in the broader community and the country communities who earn a lot of the export income for Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We really have to ask ourselves: why is it that the Federal Government is doing absolutely nothing at the moment to help alleviate the situation? It either does not understand or just does not care. I would think that people on the other side of the chamber--the people in the Government--must care; so I would say that they just do not understand or they do not have the ability to understand. Maybe they have not actually been out to see the hardship and the problems in the rural communities at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ten years ago, there were 267,000 persons employed in agriculture; last year, there were some 251,000 employed in agriculture. It is predicted that six in every hundred farmers, people employed in agriculture, will not be there next year. I believe it is time for this Government to really take stock of what is happening out there. It may say, `We do not care about it. We do not care at all because there are not a lot of votes in it for the Labor Party out there in the rural and regional areas'. But I am saying that if it lets those people go to the wall, if it lets those people out in the broader country areas go to the economic grave, then Australia will be the loser in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        I return to the Budget. In the Age, I think it was Ken Davidson who said that `the Budget is a damning indictment of a decade under Labor'. He talked of the elegant glossing over of the abject policy failures of the past half decade. He suggested that the recession is the direct consequence of gross excesses and that Australia's long term economic problem has been screamingly obvious for at least the past half decade. Basically, the Budget was a document without hope but, even more seriously, it was a document without economic strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look to see what the Morgan gallup poll found when it surveyed people out in the broader community. I quote from the Bulletin:
       </para>
       <para>
        Few Australians believe the recent federal budget was a good one and most think it will increase unemployment, a special Morgan Gallup Poll has found. Only 4% of voters interviewed in the poll described Treasurer John Kerin's first budget as "good".
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australians do not see the budget as a solution to the unemployment problem with only 4% (down eight) saying it will reduce unemployment while most (54% up six) believe it will increase unemployment levels. Some 32% (up two) think it will have little effect and 10% can't say, the poll finds.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would say that the results of that poll of the Australian public were pretty right, because unemployment has gone up. Unfortunately, I believe that it is going to go up further. Out in the wider community there is no real glimmer of hope for people who are investing money. There is no real reason for them to actually put it into something that is going to produce jobs and that is going to produce income. That is a sad thing for Australia. Surely, this Government, the Hawke-Kerin Labor Government, could have thought a bit more about it and put a bit of hope out there in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have an economy that is in absolute crisis. We have a business community which remains deeply pessimistic about the state of the economy and is reluctant to increase its level of investment expenditure. Yet we have had the Government slapping on a compulsory 5 per cent superannuation levy. The capacity of business to pay that levy is doubtful, but that does not appear to have been included in the calculations. I believe this is going to cause the higher unemployment that I talk about. We have a Treasurer who told us that it was essential to levy a $3.50 Medicare patient fee, but less than a month later that strategy is out the window. Where that leaves the expected shortfall of some $13 billion is anyone's guess.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the rural sector, there is nothing, despite the teasers put forth by the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, that there would be some good news. In fact, he talks a lot about value-adding. I am all in favour of value-adding. I saw an industry at Casino the other day. Jerky beef is actually value-adding beef, which I am quite sure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would have chewed around some of the camp fires in the outback of Queensland when you were on mustering camps. It is a value-adding product which is now being sold to tourists. The Japanese, especially, seem to like it, and it is very nice. It is a source of value-adding. It is producing some jobs. But that was there before any of this talk of value-adding at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are not going to be a lot of other people wanting to value-add unless they have the incentive to do it. There is no incentive in the economy at the moment. There was nothing in the Budget that addressed the problem of falling asset prices, higher debt levels and high interest rates. The Budget gave the farming communities and the rural industries in general no incentive at all to invest.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been saying in this place for quite some time that the high interest rates that we have had for the last couple of years have really put into the cost structure a level of input costs that is not going to go away tomorrow even if interest rates came down dramatically. That is going to go on for quite some time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Getting back to the rural communities again, we have the drought on top of this high interest rates structure that is now affecting the input cost; we have a catastrophe about to happen out in the rural areas. It is all right for Senator Loosely to laugh. He lives in a city. He should come out to the bush and see what is happening out there. That will take the smirk off his face, I am quite sure. He will not be laughing about it as much as he is in this chamber at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Look what happened to a small airline, Hazelton Airlines, because of the rural recession and the lack of incentive to build that third runway. I think Senator Loosley is actually in favour of the third runway, so I will have to give him a bit of praise for that. After eight years, we are sort of getting closer to a decision. But a lot of his colleagues are trying to stop the building of that third runway. That is not going to help Australia. That is not going to help New South Wales--the State that Senator Loosley and I represent. So I hope  that Senator Loosley jumps on and gives a bit of kneecapping to some of his parliamentary colleagues who represent electorates around that airport so that that runway definitely gets built.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where is there anything in this Budget that will repay the moneys raised either in the Loan Bill that we have already debated or in any other way? There is no incentive for the primary producers, the manufacturers or, indeed, for any of the income generating sectors of this country. Before the Budget there was no incentive and there is still no incentive. How long can we last as an Australian community without direction and some indication that not only is there a tunnel, but also there will be a little light at the end of that tunnel?  If we do not have that direction and incentive there will be no jobs and we will face an absolute catastrophe as far as unemployment is concerned. People will walk off farms and out of businesses. They will say, `Stuff it. Why should we risk investing money until things get right?'. If people think things will improve they may invest money, but they have been given such a kick in the backside over the last eight years that I doubt whether they would want to do it under this Government.

       <para>
        Only last month, the Australian Wheat Board announced revised projections for the coming season's harvest. I have been talking to people in Queensland and people in the north-west of New South Wales whose crops have failed and the harvest will be down dramatically. The other day I visited coastal New South Wales. The cane harvest is down dramatically because of seasonal problems and some of the other problems associated with the importation of cheap sugar. It is of no surprise to those of us who are involved in the primary industries that the projections in the wheat area are the lowest for a decade, and they have been made before the full extent of the drought has been actually realised.  Tonight I have been talking to people from the Liverpool plains in the near north-west of New South Wales. The crops there are absolutely screaming out for a drink of water. If rain does not come and those crops deteriorate even more, we will face a horrific problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wheat industry has provided export income of around $3 billion, yet not a lot is being done, either by the weather or by this Government, to save it at the moment. At risk are not only our export markets but also some thousands of farmers who, if they are forced off their farms, will join the very long and growing line of people in the unemployment queue. At the moment some people in Queensland are talking about importing wheat for feedlots. If that happens there will be a bit of blood in the streets, especially if wheat is imported from any of the highly subsidised markets around the world so that even the little bit of wheat that people have here does not sell at the free market price in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        What jobs can people find in rural areas where country towns are shrinking and dying?  Where will the money come from to pay for the unemployment cheques when people finally give up all notion of keeping the farm?  The blow-out so far in the social security budget will be nothing compared with what will happen if this present recession continues for another 12 months. Yet there is no prospect of getting out of this present dilemma for at least that long.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Budget had to provide incentive, opportunity and hope. It has done none of those things. We needed economic reform measures. We got political meddling by the Reserve Bank of Australia to make the economy look better artificially. We needed structural reform which could lead to job security. We got a Budget designed to secure one job and that was the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and I am not convinced that it will do even that. The Government needed to provide leadership and direction. Already we have seen the Medicare arrangements thrown out of the window because the unelected government of this country, the ACTU, did not like them. The ACTU has been directing this Government from the wings for some time and forcing its own members onto the unemployment scrap heap in the meantime.

         —-I thank all honourable senators who have participated in this lengthy but, by comparison, relatively curtailed Appropriations debate, both for their contributions and for their procedural cooperation in allowing us to get to this point at this stage. In such a wide-ranging debate by so many honourable senators, it is obviously impossible to deal with the issues raised by all of them, or to even attempt to deal with issues raised by any of them. In the normal course I would not but for the coincidence of having been in the chamber for the last hour or so during which time Senator Reid raised a very specific point to which she requested a response. I will refer to that briefly before I refer to the Australian Democrats' amendment in concluding the debate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Reid raised a very detailed issue about the situation of Buddhists in Vietnam, which she has raised in this chamber before during Question Time and perhaps on other occasions. I have to say that I support very strongly the Government's decision to resume aid to Vietnam. I think it was a timely and appropriate decision. I am not persuaded that the issue which Senator Reid raised should be a precondition for that resumption. She did not necessarily say it should; I accept that. But I want to put my broad position on the table.
       </para>
       <para>
        All Australians, certainly all honourable senators, would share the concern for freedom of religion and tolerance of dissenting views which are a necessary part of a decent society. I share her hope that in Vietnam and in other countries in our region--notably in view of recent events in Burma--we will see a resumption of that level of tolerance and respect for human values and dissenting views. I cannot go to the detail of the points raised by Senator Reid tonight, but I will certainly refer the matter to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, for his consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the amendment which was moved by Senator Short, on behalf of the Opposition. I indicate that, of course, we will be opposing the amendment. Given that the Australian Democrats' amendment opposes one of the things that we also oppose, we will be voting for their amendment. But should that be successful, we will still vote against the Opposition's amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make only two points about this amendment. It would be unduly repetitious to deal with all of the amendment because it relates to matters that we have dealt with before in this chamber. In fact, I think almost exactly the same amendment was moved previously to the Supply Bills. My first point is that this amendment shows, once again, that the Opposition is absolutely full of apprehension that the economy might improve and that it will have to start relying upon the substance of its own policies to win support. Those opposite are now starting to try to redefine full employment. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) came up with a definition of full employment as being 6 per cent.  I have to say that is not my view, and it is not the view of anybody other than those who take an extraordinarily narrow, technical and somewhat desiccated economic view of a very profound and serious social concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many references to which one could turn to indicate the underlying reasons for the profound concern the Opposition has about the clearly impending economic recovery, the signs for which are clear and unequivocal. Today I received market insights from Westpac for October 1991. Westpac makes it absolutely clear, in the opening paragraph of the summary by the chief economist, that recent results confirm its view that there will be a modest economic recovery in the first half of 1992. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . output may have bottomed and that manufacturers are more confident than at any time since 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        The good news is on the inflation front, where there are finally signs of significant gains.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not just getting a flash in the pan inflation result, but a significant change in inflation expectations. The report continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . for the first time since the survey began in the 1960s, on balance, manufacturers are expecting prices to fall.
       </para>
       <para>
        Westpac expressed the view that there remains further scope for interest rates to fall. Page 3 of the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Leading indicators suggest the economy is on course for an upturn in the first half of 1992 . . . further declines in inflation are likely before it picks up in 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1992 Westpac is expecting real GDP growth of 2.3 per cent and inflation still at 3.5 per cent, with continuing reductions in the current account deficit. Nobody is predicting that we will go back quickly to the roaring heady days of boom leading to inevitable bust. Westpac is saying that it expects a modest and sustainable recovery, for two reasons: first, inflation is contained--one of the great inhibitors of sustained recovery--and, secondly, the balance of payments constraint is also somewhat under control.

There are, in the interests of the Australian people and to everybody else's great delight, signs that the economy is about to recover. For example, the CAI-Westpac survey of industrial trends states:

        Inflation is expected to be below 4.5 per cent right through until 1993, which is what is expected after two years of steady growth. We will still have inflation lower than or, at least, comparable with that of our OECD partners. The survey talks about the industries that will be at the vanguard of recovery. The survey states:

       <para>
        There are seven subclauses to the amendment. I could happily talk about all of them, but I will not because other speakers have exercised proper restraint in this debate and I intend to do the same. I refer to the first subclause, which makes clear the nature of the alternative response to the economy we could expect from the Opposition. At the same time, we have the Opposition feigning concern for the people who are unemployed. Everybody wishes that unemployment was much lower. The Opposition simultaneously says, `You must slash government spending' and  `You must deal with fiscal irresponsibility'--as it now calls it. The great recipe for inequity in our society is trying to balance the Budget during a recession. To cut $4.7 billion from outlays to try to balance the Budget, on the most cautious of assessments, would cost another 46,000 jobs. It also indicates that the benefits and services available to people in the greatest need in our society would be further impaired.

        I say to people that when we eventually see this much vaunted alternative economic package we should not just look at this question of consumption tax--whether it is 8 per cent, 10 per cent or 15 per cent, I do not care--which has an inequity element of its own, or at the redistribution of income tax, which also has inequity elements. The key thing to look at is the expenditure cuts where the Opposition intends to slash the spending on providing services to people in need in Australia; at the Opposition's attitude towards the people in greatest need; and at the inequitable and redistributive elements of the economic policy that will emerge when this alternative package is released.

        The shadow Minister for finance, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have all been saying that there should be expenditure cuts of $4 billion. In the course of a recession, that would cost 46,000 jobs. The Opposition would like to pretend that we would not have that sort of problem.

         —-And the Opposition is advocating a socially reprehensible policy in that circumstance. That is a cause for absolute concern. This amendment only reinforces that morally reprehensible approach. To be advocating those sorts of cuts and that sort of slashing of jobs in this environment is a clear indication of the nature of the alternative that the Australian people can look forward to.

        The fact that the Australian Democrats will vote for that element of the amendment is a surprise to me, but that is for them to express their concern about. It is one of those many indications, one of the straws in the wind, of the inequitable nature of programs which we can expect to see from the Opposition when, if ever, it releases its policy package. That is one of the several good reasons for rejecting the amendment. Apart from the gratuitous nature of the amendment, I thank honourable senators for their otherwise interesting contributions to the debate. I commend the Bills to the Senate.

       That the Senate take note of the document.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, as you know, last Thursday there was a function in the Mural Hall of this building to mark the publication of the sixth edition of Australian Senate Practice by the late J.R. Odgers. I was pleased that you attended on that occasion and spoke in support of the launching of that important work.
      </para>
      <para>
       Jim Odgers served the Senate for nearly 40 years. He was Clerk from 1965 to 1979. This sixth edition is the last to be prepared under Jim Odgers' authorship and contains his reflections on developing Senate practices as they stood at the time of his death in 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, the first edition of which appeared in 1953, is the first treatise on parliamentary procedure in an Australian parliament. Its uniqueness derives from the fact that it deals with an upper House. The book contains much wisdom on the role and value of an upper House in a system of responsible parliamentary government.
      </para>
      <para>
       As honourable senators will be aware, a measure of controversy attaches to this book. It is true to say that few of us would agree with everything in the book which, after all, runs to more than 1,000 pages. I note that one of the major issues tackled afresh in this sixth edition concerns the right of the Senate to press requests for amendments to Bills which it is unable to amend under the Constitution.
      </para>
      <para>
       Odgers clearly favours views put to the Senate in 1981 by Senator Gareth Evans, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and then shadow Attorney-General, supporting the pressing of questions. He clearly does not sympathise with the contrary views which I, as Attorney-General, put forward on behalf of the then Government. I must say that that is one instance in which I have some disagreement with the views of Mr Odgers. I understand that other senators may have disagreements about other matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is a book of character and substance, not blandness and ambiguity. The volume has been published by the Australian Capital Territory division of the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration. That body undertook the task as a service in the public interest. The volume has not been commercially produced. Any surplus funds from the sales of the book will be used to sponsor a prize for writings on parliamentary issues.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having discharged its trust, the Institute has sought my assistance in formally returning the book to the Senate, to whom it belongs and was seen by its eminent author--as the book's dedication makes plain--to belong. The Institute is keen that the book should be tabled. It views its role as having been one of temporary trust only.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are good reasons why the book should be tabled in the Senate. It is the work of one of the most eminent of Senate Clerks, commenced while he was Usher of the Black Rod. As a member of the staff, he carried it through five editions. It is not just another book about parliament: it is the most authoritative exposition of parliamentary procedure in Australia. As well, it has a status outside Australia. Although that status is perhaps not of the same order as Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice, the book is certainly highly commended and used.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reputation of the Senate as one of the most effective houses of parliament in the world derives, to some extent, from this book and the vast range of information it contains. I am pleased to see that it is already in use. I am told that it was quoted from today by the Deputy President in clarifying some ruling that he gave last night.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wish to congratulate the Institute on this considerable endeavour. It was a very bold undertaking by a small, voluntary body of Public Service professionals. It is against this background that I move this motion. I urge the Senate to support it so that this notable text can, like the five previous editions, formally take its place in the records of the Senate.

It was fitting that Senator Durack, as the longest serving senator, was asked to table the latest edition of Australian Senate Practice, commonly referred to as Odgers. We all received a letter from the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration seeking our support for this measure. I give that support wholeheartedly. I congratulate the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration on its efforts and diligence in the face of some considerable difficulty. I note that the forward has been written by Mr Alan Cumming Thom, a Clerk of this Senate from 1982 to 1988.

       It then goes on to note that other senators did not accept that argument. It quotes at length what Senator Gareth Evans, the then shadow Attorney-General, said about that. That sort of information is very important, not only for those of us who have been in this place for a good number of years but also, and perhaps more particularly, for those who have been in this place for a shorter time.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its letter to us, the Institute says that Australian Senate Practice is a great classic of Australian Government and is alongside Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice as being on the front rank of books on parliamentary procedure. I agree that this is an important book not only for members of this chamber and indeed the other chamber, should they care to look at it, but also for students of politics and the Australian parliamentary democratic processes and for the public in general.
      </para>
      <para>
       As it says in its letter, the Institute undertook the publication as a trust in the public interest. That is just what it is. I for one appreciated receiving a personal copy of this work. It is my intention to refer to it when the occasion arises, as it no doubt will. It may arise more often in a future parliament; I do not know. Who knows what the future holds for us. I conclude by thanking the Institute for undertaking the publication of this work and commend the motion to the Senate.

         —-I raise one matter under this reservation which relates to Sri Lanka and the potential for CHOGM to address, in the light of the Commonwealth's attempts to find for itself a relevant future, its capacity to help Sri Lanka through a long and agonising civil war. I acknowledged when I earlier raised this matter--I guess it was more than a year ago--the cooperation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, in raising the question of the role of the Commonwealth in Sri Lanka with President Premadasa and also that of Prime Minister Hawke in writing to him.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As the Minister would be aware, there has ensued from time to time discussions with the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth and others as to whether the Commonwealth could play a role. The answer has continually been that unless Sri Lanka invites the Commonwealth to assist it, there is no role that the Commonwealth can play. The argument that I have sought to advance in answer to that has been that there should come a time when the Commonwealth demonstrates sufficient confidence in itself to recognise an opportunity to be helpful, even when the Commonwealth member concerned feels that because of loss of face or for some other reason it is unable itself to initiate a call for help.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was hoping that CHOGM, particularly as it addresses the paper that has been prepared by the high level group of experts on what might be future opportunities for it, would be specifically addressing the question of Sri Lanka on its agenda. The best information that I have been able to get is that it is not. I ask the Minister whether that is so. If it is so, I register my disappointment if that means that Prime Minister Hawke is not prepared to raise the issue during this Harare CHOGM.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst recognising that it remains a difficult issue, I think that in many ways it demonstrates the sort of test that the Commonwealth is now going to face as it searches for a contemporary role and relevance. I ask the Minister whether the issue of Sri Lanka in fact appeared on the agenda and whether Prime Minister Hawke went to CHOGM with the intention of raising and pursuing the issue and really volunteering the resources and goodwill of the Commonwealth to help Sri Lanka with this very serious difficulty?

         —-Senator Hill has rightly indicated that this is a very delicate and sensitive matter, not only so far as Sri Lanka is concerned; all the countries of the Commonwealth are also only too conscious of their own prerogatives when it comes to internal matters. However, the question of the Commonwealth's role in relation to human rights is manifestly one of the key issues that will be discussed, both in the context of the high level advisory group and, hopefully, in the larger CHOGM plenary as well.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is certainly my hope and Australia's hope that the Commonwealth will take some steps down the particular path of playing a helpful role in improving the human rights climate in Commonwealth countries through a good offices role for the Commonwealth institution itself. Certainly I know that Prime Minister Hawke is well primed to participate and advance that particular debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as Sri Lanka itself is concerned, Australia has remained active in the search for a peaceful solution to that conflict. As I previously indicated to Senator Hill and as he has accurately retailed tonight, our judgment has been that the internal affairs of a member state can only properly be the subject of the kind of initiative he and we have in mind as a result of a direct request from the Government of that state and with the broad support of other Commonwealth members. It just is physically impossible to contemplate a situation of intervention over the top. That is not to say that one cannot explore in the corridors and in private discussions just what the degree of receptiveness would be to some such initiative. I am sure that discussions of that type will take place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The big difficulty is that the LTTE in Sri Lanka is still showing no signs at all of being prepared to engage in a conciliatory process, even with all the help in the world for face-saving ways through the situation offered from outside. Similarly, the Sri Lankan Government itself, facing as it does a no confidence motion in parliament and with considerable concern about its own degree of domestic support within the southern part of Sri Lanka, is really not in an optimal position to be taking risks so far as conciliatory processes are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the climate is not particularly forthcoming at the moment for these kinds of initiatives. All I can say to Senator Hill is that we will do our very best to pursue the matter further. There are ways of advancing these matters other than by formally opening them up in plenary session debate, as I am sure he will be aware. It is my understanding that there will be some discussion around the margins. We can only hope that will be productive.

Whilst it does not give me great heart, nevertheless it is at least indicative of a recognition of the problem and some goodwill towards making a contribution to a solution. It disappoints me that the difficult and most serious problems tend to be avoided purely because of that difficulty. I put it in the context of a request I had that the matter be put on the agenda of the executive meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which is another parliamentary body. That was deemed to be too controversial and too difficult as well.

        I do say to the Minister that if the Commonwealth is going to have a role in the future it is going to need to demonstrate greater confidence in itself as a group than it has in the past. Whereas I recognise some of its initiatives in relation to tentative contributions to nation building and some support through its human rights arm in relation to improving the human rights record within the Commonwealth and also its embryonic efforts in election monitoring and therefore in enhancing the democratic process, I would say to the Minister that there are many other groups throughout the world that are also engaging in these functions and the distinction that we always understood to be between the Commonwealth and other such groups is that there is some form of special bond that has arisen out of the historical linkages that, when put to the test, can be useful. That is why I raise this issue of Sri Lanka, recognising all the difficulties that are concerned with it.
       </para>

        I repeat to the Minister that here is an opportunity for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that it has a useful purpose, a useful future; that is preferable to its engaging in strenuous efforts to find a role for itself in other areas.

         —-I wanted to raise a matter under multilateral trade negotiations. It really arises, in part, from a comment by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, on his return to Australia from the bilateral trade delegation that visited Europe, in which I had the honour to participate the week before last, and in part from an answer given by Senator Evans to a question from his own side today on the progress of the Uruguay Round.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The concern that I have was the statement by Minister Blewett, as it has been reported, that Australia is urging a take it or leave it document to be prepared by Arthur Dunkel, the Director-General of GATT. Minister Evans today in Question Time, in the answer to which I referred, indicated that, as we understood it, Mr Dunkel was preparing a final document which would include those matters upon which agreement had been reached and those upon which agreement had not been reached, and he would set out what he believes would be a satisfactory outcome. That, in some circumstances, might be a reasonable way to approach a very difficult issue in which, regrettably, nation states have not demonstrated the resolve to tackle and negotiate the outstanding difficult subject matters, whether they have been in relation to agriculture, services, trade, market access or, in some cases, intellectual property.
       </para>
       <para>
        The danger is that Mr Dunkel--and I only mention in passing his European background--in an effort to facilitate an outcome to the Round, will tend to take the lowest common denominator position in those areas where he has been forced, in effect, to put down a position for the parties through their failure to meet what ought to have been accepted as their challenge and responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a very worrying position for Australia. What may well happen--and what I fear will happen--is that the compromise that Mr Dunkel will record on agriculture will be very much a minimal outcome compromise. That will be because, even though it seems that the European Community has given its negotiators some more flexibility, I suspect that it is little more flexibility. Therefore, I believe that it is unlikely to be an offer that much advances the totally unsatisfactory position of last year. I remind you, Mr Chairman, that the position of last year was a 30 per cent reduction over 10 years, backdated to 1986, which, in real terms, would have given about a 15 per cent reduction over the next five years, or roughly 3 per cent a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I accept that the Cairns Group and Australia have been lobbying not only for a reduction in numbers but also for specifics that at least could give agricultural producers in this country greater certainty as to the future: specifics, as the Minister said in his answer today, in relation to internal subsidies and market access, particularly moving to tariffs and a specified definition of export subsidies and some reduction.  It seems there is a fair chance of negotiating those definitions.
       </para>
       <para>
        If, on top of the negotiation of those definitions, there is a very small reduction in figures, the position for Australian producers over the next few years will be really appalling. I put that in the sense that Europe is now subsidising wheat, for example, through export subsidies by providing a subsidy in excess of 100 per cent of the price that Australian producers get for the sale of their products.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, if the result of the Round is that there is some certainty for the future in definitions--to use a bad expression, there is a cap put on the level--that may be meaningful in the distant future. But for Australian agricultural producers for the next few years it is going to be of little or no help, and they will continue to go broke as quickly as they are now because Australian agricultural producers can compete with agricultural producers elsewhere but they cannot compete with governments. They particularly cannot compete with the might of the economic blocs of Europe, on the one hand, and the United States, on the other.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, I come back to where I started. If my scenario of a lowest common denominator on agriculture is what is produced in the package because that is the best way to reach an outcome, and the compensation for Europe is in the agreement on the services in intellectual property, then that might be satisfactory for Europe but it will not be satisfactory for Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one puts that in the context of our Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, advocating and pressing upon Mr Dunkel that he do this on a take it or leave it basis, that causes me major concern in relation to the position of Australian agricultural producers. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to ask the Minister whether it is the case that we are arguing for a position to be produced by Mr Dunkel--that is, a take it or leave it paper. Am I not therefore correct in saying that, more likely than not, the Dunkel process--if I might refer to it as that--will result in a minimal outcome for agriculture and an outcome that over the next few years will be of little or no benefit to Australian agricultural producers?

         —-I do not know what we would do without Senator Hill keeping us to the last in respect of these negotiations. We are obviously profoundly insensitive, indifferent and ignorant of the long term needs of Australian agricultural producers and we need a little bit of touching up on a daily or weekly basis to make us understand what the issues are. I am indebted to Senator Hill for helping us in that respect because, without his assistance, we would manifestly be in very great trouble understanding the issues that we are involved in that have been occupying us for the last five years and, in principle, for rather longer than that, but there it is.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Obviously there is a very real concern about lowest common denominator outcomes. There is a very real perception that a poor outcome for the Uruguay Round in agriculture and, indeed, across the spectrum may well be worse than not having an outcome at all, and we are not going to settle for a poor outcome for the Uruguay Round. However, we are going to try like anything to get a positive outcome for the Round, and we have been very actively involved in setting in train the processes to produce that. We all hope that it will not be necessary for Mr Dunkel, in the context of the agricultural negotiations, to produce a paper on a take it or leave it--or any other--basis in mid-November. We hope that the agricultural negotiators will be able to close the present gaps. We hope that there will be conceptual agreement on the three big issues of market access, internal support and export subsidies.
       </para>
       <para>
        We hope there will be agreement on realistic numbers--much better numbers than those that appeared last year to which Senator Hill referred--before the negotiations are concluded. What we are saying is that in the event that those gaps cannot be breached, in the event that we cannot get realistic and sensible concepts and numbers emerging from that process, then the only way forward may be to work with the chairman's text of the kind that I mentioned today coming from Mr Dunkel.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said today--and I did not use the language of take it or leave it--all participants, once such a paper is down, will then have to decide whether they will make the difficult political decisions needed to unblock the Round, especially in agricultural services and market access. Obviously, there are a number of issues to be simultaneously resolved not only in agriculture but also in services, market access, intellectual property and so on, in which there are competing perspectives from the major players--Europe, Japan, the United States and third force countries like ourselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is our expectation that there will necessarily be some trade-offs across the spectrum of issues. That is what one would expect in a complex negotiation of this kind. The bottom lines have to be credible bottom lines so far as our major areas of interest are concerned. At the moment, we are walking the difficult path of indicating a willingness to discuss, negotiate and bargain seriously on these issues--in other words, to be prepared to introduce some degree of flexibility into the end game--but, at the same time, to indicate that there are certain basic principles and positions below which we will not go, and that we will walk away from the Round if necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those messages have been communicated very succinctly, very effectively and very professionally by Dr Blewett and the team of negotiators who have been working on this so closely for so long. From his own experience with the bipartisan delegation that recently visited Europe, Senator Hill would be aware that there is a sophisticated appreciation of the issues so far as the Government and government officials are concerned. To the extent that Senator Hill needs reassurance on this matter, can I reassure him now that we are perfectly conscious of the danger of getting a lowest common denominator solution--of getting an outcome which pitches too low. We are very conscious of the positions of the major players. At the moment we are trying to make judgments as to what kinds of outcomes will be realistic, given those positions, but we are not going to sell the ship, we are not going to sell any of the basic principles and we are not going to abdicate any of the interests which, for so long, we have so staunchly stood for during these negotiations.

         —-In view of his gratuitous comments at the beginning of his speech I simply say that although the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) indicates that, in effect, he gave a different answer today, the basis of my concern was the recorded statement by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, that Australia not only was pressing for but also would accept a take it or leave it paper by Mr Dunkel. In fact, I notice that that report appeared in the press again today, so presumably it has not been contradicted by Dr Blewett in the meantime. I now take it that the senior Minister is saying that that is not the position, that Australia is not pressing a take it or leave it package and if I am correct in that interpretation, I am pleased to hear it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Obviously, in this forum or in any other I cannot ask the Minister what is the bottom line when he says that Australia will not settle for a poor outcome. I have taken the opportunity tonight to say that I do fear that if the compromise settlement does not give real and substantial reductions--particularly in export subsidies--agriculture and Australian producers, as fair traders, will suffer in the next few years, which is an unsatisfactory outcome for Australian agricultural producers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I trust that the Australian Government, as I said, despite the gratuitous and helpful comments of the Minister, understands the suffering of Australian agricultural producers and understands the impossibility of the burden that they have in finding themselves having to compete with governments, not with other producers. I hope the Government recognises that a deal which the Government would no doubt like to achieve is not a deal that is in Australia's best interests unless it provides those reductions during the next few years.

We are talking about the chairman of the agricultural negotiating group, Mr Dunkel, removing the square brackets, producing a text which, in his judgment, is one that ought to be acceptable to all the parties. It will then be a matter for the judgment of the parties themselves at the end of that process, as to whether it is acceptable. It is a way of describing a negotiating practice to which one may be forced when a complex multilateral process of bargaining across a multitude of subject areas is potentially breaking down.

         —-Needless to say, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will be fully aware of the issue that I am gong to raise about Mr Burke and his telephone bill. I thank the Minister for the further answers to the questions asked in the Estimates Committee. I wonder whether he would be kind enough to explain to the Senate exactly why, with regard to telephone costs for the chancery and the residence during the last three years, the embassy in Dublin went in the opposite direction to other embassies. The updated figures are quite crystal clear in showing that there was an excessive use of the telephone by Mr Burke in Dublin vis-a-vis that in comparable posts in Copenhagen and Madrid.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If we look at the chancery in Madrid, for example, its costs in the past three years went from $42,000 to $22,000 to $34,000, a total of $98,000; while Mr Burke's telephone bill for the chancery went from $26,000 to $50,000 to $69,000, a total of $145,000. Right along the line, his expenditure goes in the opposite way. The percentages always look rather cute when they are compared with those of other posts, but it is not comparing apples with apples, it is comparing apples with oranges. For example, in 1988-89 the Ambassador in Copenhagen paid 38.88 per cent of his total residential telephone bill which amounted to only $1,391 of a total of $3,578. Yet Mr Burke paid a mere 8.79 per cent, which was a repayment of only $200 more, but is on the basis of a total bill of $17,283. Sadly, the Minister could not give a continental, as he is quite clearly showing at the moment. Maybe he might care to answer that question.

The people in this particular post seem to have been conspicuously enthusiastic about the spoken word.

         —-In mid-September I had the privilege of leading, under the auspices of the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, the official observer mission for the inaugural direct election for the Hong Kong Legislative Council, which was held on Sunday, 15 September 1991. Although this election gave Hong Kong residents for the first time the opportunity to directly elect representatives to the Legislative Council, it by no means signalled the arrival of full-blown democracy in this British colony.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The election was for 18 out of a total of 60 legislative councillors. Of the remaining 42, 21 were elected from the so-called functional constituencies on 12 September; 18 were appointed by the Governor subsequent to the election; while three are ex officio members of the Council. This reflects the fact that Hong Kong is not gaining its independence, as other former colonies have, but reverting from British to Chinese sovereignty under guidelines set forth in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong.
       </para>
       <para>
        This agreement outlines the process of Hong Kong's formal change of sovereignty and provides for the drafting of what is described as a Basic Law, which will serve as Hong Kong's constitution after 1 July 1997. Under the formula established in the Joint Declaration and the subsequent Basic Law, Hong Kong's administrative development should follow a path of what is described as convergence from the British colonial order towards the laws and structures of the Basic Law. Thus, by establishing the end points of the process, relatively distinct parameters have been placed on Hong Kong's political development prior to 1997 which leave only a narrow role for representative governance. After 1997, the Basic Law becomes substantially more vague about Hong Kong's democratic development, giving no guarantees of democratic self-rule and few assurances to the people of Hong Kong.
       </para>
       <para>
        The background to this development is, of course, the expiration of Britain's lease of the New Territories from China which is due in 1997. With that time rapidly approaching, in December 1984--after some two years of negotiations--Great Britain and the People's Republic of China signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which states in sum that China will regain sovereignty not only over the New Territories but also over Hong Kong and Kowloon in 1997.
       </para>
       <para>
        So China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 but, under the Joint Declaration, it was agreed that it would establish a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Under this Special Administrative Region, the intention was to uphold national unity and territorial integrity for Hong Kong, taking into account its history and its lifestyle; so the Central People's Government in Beijing would have direct authority over the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, but Hong Kong would experience a high degree of autonomy, with the exception of foreign affairs and defence matters which would be the responsibility of the Central People's Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hong Kong's laws currently in force were to remain basically unchanged under the administration of the Special Administrative Region. The Special Administrative Region was to be responsible for the executive, legislative and independent judicial administration, including that of final adjudication. Under the agreement, the chief executive of the Special Administrative Region was to be nominated by the Central People's Republic of China and he, in turn, was to nominate principal officials to be appointed by the Chinese People's Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was agreed that China would not change Hong Kong's current lifestyle, including primarily the social and economic systems. The Special Administrative Region was to ensure by law the rights and freedoms of persons, speech, the press, assembly, association, travel, movement, correspondence, strike, choice, occupation, academic research and religious beliefs. China was also to allow the Special Administrative Region to remain a free port of trade and a separate customs territory. China was to allow the full flow of capital and the continuation of foreign exchange, gold, securities and futures markets, which would contribute to the continuation of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Chinese Government was not to levy taxes and would allow the Special Administrative Region to exercise independent finances. China was to allow the Special Administrative Region to establish mutually beneficial economic relations with foreign countries, even if the People's Republic of China did not do the same.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong was to be allowed, independent of China, to maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude relevant agreements with states, regions and independent organisations. Finally, the Government of the Special Administrative Region was to be responsible for the maintenance of public law within the region. All of these issues, which were set forth in the Joint Declaration between Britain and China, were then to be stipulated in what I mentioned earlier was described as the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which would remain unchanged for 50 years and was, in effect, to be the constitution for Hong Kong.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1990, the Basic Law was promulgated. Perhaps, as a result of that law being promulgated not so long after the events of Tiananmen Square, it was not as liberal in its provisions for Hong Kong as had been anticipated. Mr Martin Lee, QC, a legislative councillor in Hong Kong, among others, has led the challenge to the Basic Law, both within Hong Kong and in the international community at large. Many agree with him that the new document does not accurately reflect the Sino-British Joint Declaration which, it is claimed, promised a fully elected legislature, an executive which is accountable to that legislature and an independent judiciary with the final power of interpretation of law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Lee and others have outlined what they argue are breaches of the Sino-British Joint Declaration with regard to its application on the Basic Law. Generally, the pro-democracy movement, which was a major player in the elections in mid-September, objected to allowing only one-third of the legislature to be directly elected by 1997. Under the Basic Law, the rest of the legislature will continue to be elected through what are described as functional constituencies, representing various occupational groups such as the legal profession, the medical profession, teachers, trade unions, chambers of commerce and so on, and an election committee--in effect an electoral college--which would be under the control of the Beijing Government by 1997.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Basic Law provides that, even by the year 2007, only half of the Hong Kong legislature will be democratically elected. It makes no promise of a majority--let alone all--of the legislature for Hong Kong to be directly elected in the future. The Basic Law also appears to contravene the Sino-British Joint Declaration since that declaration provided that the executive authorities would be accountable to the legislature. However, in the Basic Law, it appears as though the legislature will not have that degree of power.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislature will be denied the power to pass a vote of no confidence against the chief executive, who will not be democratically elected but selected by an election committee--again an electoral college appointed by the Beijing Government and in fact removable only by the Beijing Government. The chief executive, in contrast, will have the power to unilaterally dissolve the legislature. In other words, while that legislature does not have the power to sack or pass a vote of no confidence in the chief executive, the chief executive himself can unilaterally dissolve and dismiss the Legislative Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 159 of the Basic Law gives the People's Republic of China the power to amend it unilaterally without the consent of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Under the Basic Law, it is Beijing which has the final power of adjudication on interpreting the Basic Law. That final power of interpretation of adjudication rests not with the courts in Hong Kong, as it was expected would be the case under the Joint Declaration but, in fact, with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. That is very important background to the issues that were at stake in the Hong Kong election.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current executive and legislative functions in Hong Kong are embodied in the Executive Council and the Legislative Council respectively. But final authority for legislation and administration lies with the Governor under the colonial status of Hong Kong. The Executive Council remains entirely appointed by the Governor at this time, and it is his principal policy adviser. It acts under sworn confidentiality and joint responsibility for decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        After the September election, the Legislative Council consists of three ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor, 21 members elected from the functional constituencies which I described a few moments ago and 18 directly elected members. This is a total of 60 members of the Legislative Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to the Executive Council and the Legislative Council, Hong Kong does have partly elected, partly appointed urban councils. In the New Territories, there is a similarly partly elected, partly appointed regional council as well as, under a district administration scheme, district management committees and district boards which have some elected officials. Those urban and regional councils have had elected members for several years. So there has been a measure of democracy developing in Hong Kong for some time now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until 1984, the Legislative Council was fully appointed by the Government, but it was at that time that functional constituencies were introduced whereby a certain number of members of that Council were elected from various occupational groups. Each occupational group had one member elected. As the proportions that I spoke about a few moments ago indicate, at most, by 1997 directly elected members of the Legislative Council will make up only one-third of its total. Of course, that is a very important point with regard to the recent election and also with the next direct election due in four years time, in 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because the system is a derivation of the British colonial administration, there is no clear separation of legislative and executive functions. This has the immediate effect of leaving the Legislative Council in a tenuous position with regard to its authority and responsibilities. It is clear that the Executive Council is by far the most powerful of the two bodies in policy making and in governing Hong Kong in general. All legislation considered and passed by the Legislative Council must receive the approval of the Governor-in-Council before it becomes law.

        Of course, Hong Kong enjoys a strong common law tradition and a well-established framework of modern corporate and procedural laws, but these laws are virtually silent on political matters. The legal consideration of electoral politics is confined to the Legislative Council (Electoral Provisions) Ordinance and (Procedural) Regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The citizens of Hong Kong expect the electoral legal framework to grow and change as Hong Kong's political experience grows. It is very hard to predict what form future electoral laws and practice will take. On the occasion of the first ever direct election for the Legislative Council last month, it was important for the Hong Kong people to express their hopes and concerns about Hong Kong's path into the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the creation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong's political environment has been of a precarious nature. Having been a British colony for more than a century, Hong Kong has experienced little independent political activity. Political participation by the residents has been limited. In the recent history of Hong Kong, since 1982 there have been just five elections in the colony. They were for those urban councils and district boards that I referred to a few moments ago. In each case, the voter turnout has been relatively limited, ranging from a low of 22 per cent in 1983 to a 57.6 per cent turnout in 1985.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, when we consider that turnout, while it may seem low in comparison with our own situation, we need to remember that we have compulsory voting whereas in Hong Kong, as in many other countries, voluntary voting is in vogue. But it is also important to remember that British colonial rule makes no provision for the formation of local parties. Indeed, it does not encourage the organisation of interest groups, and this may well explain to some extent the lack of participation to this date in Hong Kong politics.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the low participation rates that Hong Kong has experienced thus far, there is an increased awareness of political affairs amongst the residents of Hong Kong. Certainly, political participation in Hong Kong has increased significantly over the past few years. In Hong Kong it is fair to say that the political climate oscillates between pessimism and optimism. There are those who believe that they can make a difference in determining Hong Kong's political future.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as politics is concerned, group activity in Hong Kong is organised around one issue: how to deal with the People's Republic of China when 1997 rolls around. Although there are a few small pro Taiwanese groups, a few Chinese mainland infiltrated groups and one newly developing group called the Hong Kong Democratic Foundation, in practice there are only two major groups with an effective political presence in Hong Kong. They are the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong and the United Democrats of Hong Kong. These two parties have both similarities and differences. They are similar in their views on the issue of Hong Kong's economic future. Both groups advocate and are committed to working towards maintaining Hong Kong's economic status within the international community. Both groups are adamant about preserving Hong Kong's free enterprise, free market economy. There are certainly no qualms about this issue. When it comes to economics, all of Hong Kong has agreed that the primary goal is to make a profit.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are, in fact, two issues that determine group activity in Hong Kong: namely, economics, about which these two major groups agree; and the People's Republic of China, about which the two groups disagree. The United Democrats of Hong Kong aim to challenge the People's Republic of China for democratic reform up to and beyond 1997, while the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong does not. The United Democrats propose changing the newly determined Basic Law and advocate democratisation in Hong Kong at a much more rapid pace. The Liberal Democratic Federation does not want to aggravate the People's Republic, fearing that, if it does, it will see no freedom whatsoever in post-1997 Hong Kong. The Liberal Democratic Federation has taken a more conservative and slow-paced approach to democratisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United Democrats are led by Martin Lee, QC, who visited Australia in April of this year and presented his arguments to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He and his Party have certainly received more exposure on the international scene than the Liberal Democratic Federation. Mr Lee testified before the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June 1990 on the issue of the denial of democracy and human rights before and after 1997 in Hong Kong. His Party has also submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in March 1991 a protest regarding the Sino-British Joint Declaration and British obligations under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. As I mentioned, on 11 April, Martin Lee himself appeared before our own Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, reinforcing the arguments that he had put to those other bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the similarity of the manifestos and agendas of these two parties, Hong Kong politics is clearly one-issue oriented, that is, the issue of the People's Republic. The Liberal Democratic Federation would like to educate enough people, gather enough support and have enough democratisation to be able to co-exist peacefully and in a mutually beneficial relationship with the Chinese.
       </para>
       <para>
        Martin Lee and the United Democrats do not trust the People's Republic and want to have as little to do with it as possible in the near and distant future. Martin Lee is quite willing to rock the boat and do what is necessary to establish democratic roots in Hong Kong and to gain political autonomy for the region after 1997. He and others contest that the Basic Law does not adhere to the promises agreed upon within the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth recalling that Mr Lee actually served from 1985 to 1989 as a member of the People's Republic of China-appointed Basic Law drafting committee--the mainland dominated group entrusted with the drafting of Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. He gained widespread support in Hong Kong for his position as the drafting committee's leading proponent of democracy and human rights. It was on that basis that he was removed from the drafting committee by the People's Republic Government after his criticism of the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
       </para>
       <para>
        In contrast, the Liberal Democratic Federation accepts the Basic Law as it is and advocates an attempt to work within the system. That party is more interested in local level issues, as opposed to focusing on political development or the promotion of democracy for its own sake. The Liberal Democratic Federation has, therefore, been accused of being too accommodating to the Chinese and too conservative in its approach to democratic political development.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the activities of these two parties, it is worth noting that in the recent elections some 70 per cent of candidates--not only for the recent Legislative Council elections but also for the earlier regional and urban council elections--chose not to affiliate with either of the two major parties. That, in part, reflects the fact that Hong Kong currently lacks a significant political environment within which to organise and participate. Apart from those two major parties, there are some smaller groups, such as Meeting Point and the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. As I said, there were a number of independent candidates, particularly in the Legislative Council elections.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not the purpose of the observer mission to in any way interfere with the electoral process in these elections but rather to conduct ourselves in an unbiased and non-partisan manner at all times. The threefold purpose of the mission in observing the Hong Kong elections was: firstly, to bring international attention to the status of Hong Kong's democratic development; secondly, to report on what degree of the internationally accepted standards of accessibility, transparency, fairness, openness and electoral due process existed in the Hong Kong electoral system; and, thirdly, to offer any insights which we, as individuals experienced in international affairs and practical politics, may have gained through our observations of various types of political systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        In pursuit of these objectives, the observer mission spent several days prior to election day obtaining briefings from a range of people with information and expertise relevant to our task. These included diplomats, business representatives, academics, representatives of political parties and government electoral officials. We also informally observed the latter stages of the campaign, including media coverage.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under my leadership, the mission also consisted of a representative from the Philippines, Mr Mariano Quesada, the vice-chairman for Mobilisation of the National Citizens Movement for Free Elections; from Britain, Mr John Whittingdale, OBE, former political secretary to former Prime Minister Thatcher and a Conservative Party candidate for the next elections; and three people from the United States: Mr Steven Saunders, an international public policy consultant, and Susan Gerrick and Shelly Stewart, both senior Congressional advisers. We were ably assisted in fulfilling our responsibilities by Institute staff Meg Thompson, Ed Stewart, Jeff Crouse and Jennifer Prah.
       </para>
       <para>
        On election day we split into five groups of two and, with an interpreter and driver to assist, visited as many polling booths as possible between the polling hours within the electoral divisions allocated to us. It should be noted that the polling hours were between 7.30 a.m. and 10.30 p.m.   As there were nine constituencies, this involved four of the teams covering two constituencies each and the remaining team covering the largest constituency.
       </para>
       <para>
        At each polling booth we interviewed voters leaving after casting their vote, party workers handing out how-to-vote cards, pollsters conducting exit polls and, occasionally, polling booth officials who ventured outside. As will be explained later, we were precluded from observing the electoral process inside the booths.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 18 seats--two from each of the nine constituencies--attracted a total of 54 candidates from a wide range of backgrounds. A number represented the several parties, but many were independent candidates. Most of the candidates were well supported by polling booth workers canvassing for votes with how-to-vote cards on election day. Often we saw eight, 10 or more workers for each candidate at the polling booths--an enthusiastic, but congested demonstration of democracy in action. At the end of the day and the next morning we met to pool our experiences and conclusions regarding the electoral process and prepared a final statement which was the subject of a press conference on Monday afternoon, 16 September. I seek leave to incorporate that statement in Hansard.

       <para>
        We are an international delegation sponsored by the National Republican Institute for International Affairs and are here to observe the first direct elections for the Legislative Council. Comprised of 10 delegates representing four nations, we bring to this delegation our individual and institutional experience in international affairs, election administration and practical politics. Having observed elections in twenty-three countries, the Republican Institute has developed significant and expertise in transitional political environments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Republican Institute has sent four study missions over the course of the past seven months in order to conduct an ongoing analysis of the democratic process in Hong Kong. The delegation has had discussions with political party leaders, election administrators, government representatives, members of the academic community, and foreign diplomats. On election day, our delegation divided into five teams which were deployed to all nine constituencies to interview voters, candidates, polling agents and election officials. Throughout the day, our teams visited over seventy polling stations. Unlike all previous Republican Institute observer missions, we were not allowed to enter polling stations actually to witness the voting and counting process. Our primary purpose was to assess the overall electoral process, to demonstrate international recognition of emerging democratic institutions in Hong Kong, and to offer suggestions to the Hong Kong Government for its forthcoming electoral review.
       </para>
       <para>
        The development and implementation of representative government in Hong Kong is the affair and responsibility of the citizens of this territory. However, Hong Kong is an international city with international importance. As a demonstration of international support for the future of Hong Kong, we believe the international community has a duty to assess and to comment on Hong Kong's political situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delegation commends the residents of Hong Kong, who as voters, candidates, and government officials, participated in these historic elections. Their commitment to the democratic process is encouraging for Hong Kong's future stability, prosperity, and democracy. Furthermore, we were particularly impressed with the level of voluntary participation by supporters working on behalf of candidates and parties, and by the professionalism with which the technical aspects of the elections were conducted.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have reached several conclusions. The following comments and suggestions for consideration are made in order to assist Hong Kong as it refines and further develops its democratic system. These observations are made based on the experience of this international group and in comparison to international democratic practices. A more thorough assessment of the electoral process will be published in the near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to election day procedures:
       </para>
       <para>
        -  In order to allow further development of and identification with political parties, party names and symbols should be included next to the names of candidates on the ballot.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  The number of polling stations should be increased in order to avoid overcrowding in the event of a large voter turnout.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  The "buffer zone" surrounding each polling station should be more clearly defined in order to maintain order at polling stations.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  Obtaining signatures of voters next to their names on electoral rolls as they collect their ballot at the polling table could assure greater control over access to ballots and a more transparent process.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  The delegation heard complaints of and witnessed voters being inconvenienced by canvassers and campaigners outside the polling stations. Placing stricter limits on the areas in which canvassers are allowed could alleviate this problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  Provisions could be considered to allow the vote to absentee registered voters.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  Given the fact that 18 is the age of majority in Hong Kong, extending the franchise to persons who have reached that age might be considered.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  The vote counting and tabulation procedures could be moved from the counting centre to the polling station level so as to ensure greater transparency and more timely announcement of results at the polling station level.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the registration process:
       </para>
       <para>
        -  The registration system should be clarified and publicised and the timing of registration more flexible so as to allow more eligible voters the necessary time to register.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  The voter registration process could be reviewed and reformed in such a way as to reduce the chance of legal voters from being dropped from the voter rolls incorrectly.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the campaign process:
       </para>
       <para>
        -  Political association and activity should be given greater legal guarantees and protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  We received widespread complaints that candidates exceeded the established spending limit. Campaign spending limits should be increased in order for political parties and candidates to carry out their activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  Clearer guidelines should be established concerning what constitutes campaign expenditures and contributions.
       </para>
       <para>
        -  As the political system develops and matures, the electronic media should make itself more available for candidate and political party use.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the delegation suggests that an independent electoral commission be considered to be comprised of persons drawn from all concerned sectors. Such a body could be responsible for geographical boundaries, voter registration, election disputes and protests, poll and tabulation security, appointment and training of election officials, registration of political parties, public disclosure of candidate funding and spending, and the administration of the election day procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the view of this delegation, yesterday's Legislative Council elections were peaceful and orderly. Despite the limitations of our observation, we believe that the polling and tabulation were conducted in a fair manner. We have seen no evidence of centralised or systematic fraud in the conduct of election day activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delegation thanks the citizens of the territory for their assistance and hospitality during our work here. We congratulate the people of Hong Kong on this democratic and historic achievement.

         —-I thank the Senate and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). This statement summarises and makes recommendations regarding a number of issues concerning the electoral process in Hong Kong upon which I will seek to enlarge.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It needs to be understood that political parties in Hong Kong are not legally recognised as specific politically motivated organisations which are distinct from business corporations or other private voluntary associations. As such, they are governed by laws designed to regulate societies or business corporations. As can be expected, this has given rise to problems in adapting the structures and operations of political parties to the established regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        One example of this is the function of political fundraising. Fundraising activities are governed by social welfare and police laws. Public soliciting of funds has always been directly and solely associated with charitable social welfare organisations and thus they are regulated through government agencies appropriate to these activities. These same agencies have explicitly and implicitly disallowed any political content to the charitable activities within their purview. Since this extends to public fundraising, political parties have been unable to collect funds and hold membership drives in public places. Permits are granted for activities in certain easily regulated and controlled areas, such as sports stadiums, but this has proved relatively ineffective when compared to open public solicitation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another example of this has been the application of police regulations to public rallies or meetings. In Hong Kong, any loudspeaker to be used in public must be registered with the police. Several political leaders have been arrested for using unregistered loudspeakers during political rallies in the election campaign. This type of regulation, in addition to a general hesitancy about political activities, has hindered political organisations in organising events and publicly disseminating their platforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        An explicit law requiring registration of political parties could lend itself to greater and more explicit regulation of parties which would serve as an even greater barrier to political activity. However, it is apparent that there needs to be some legal consideration of political parties' rights to organise and conduct political activities freely. The current laws applicable to political parties, at best, hinder political party activity and, at worst, have acted as a principal obstacle to political party formation and the conduct of organised political activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to political expenditures, individual candidates for the geographical constituencies were limited to an expenditure of $HK200,000 or about $A33,000. In a relatively expensive Hong Kong, this amount is far too low to enable candidates to conduct a viable electoral campaign honestly. While the Government provides postage for two mailings for each candidate free of charge, the printing of these mailings can nearly wipe out the candidate's allotted expenditure. This situation forces virtually all candidates to evade the expenditure restrictions quietly, thus rendering one of the few campaign regulations inoperative. We found plenty of anecdotal evidence during our investigations that this overspending with regard to the regulation had indeed occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, political parties, as corporations, have no general limit on expenditures. This fact could promote the formation of political parties, but the very ambiguous line between party and individual expenditure makes the activities of a party suspect when they come close to operating in the interest of individuals. A party's expenditures must be limited to promoting ideas of the party, some of which may be held in common with individuals. The grey areas between party and individual expenditure leave a lot of room for intentional or unintentional violation of the laws. The embryonic nature of the legal framework and the permissive attitude of the Hong Kong authorities have allowed such legal questions to go unchallenged. It is clear that this is an area of unanticipated problems which must be dealt with as the legal framework matures.

         —-I will take only a minute or two of the Senate's time. I want to pursue the matter that I raised last night just one step further. I ask whether the Deputy President will give some further consideration to the explanation that he gave in the Senate today of the ruling that he made last night. I think this is important and I will explain why.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I appreciate the fact that Senator Colston in fact gave that explanation. I also appreciate the fact that he made it quite clear that, on reflection, he accepts that to say a senator misled the Senate is not unparliamentary. As a result, this will not be on the record as a precedent of the Senate. However, what I do think is unfair--and I ask him to give further consideration to this--is the explanation of his ruling that, although to say that a senator misled the Senate is not unparliamentary, Senator Bishop, when she said that, was acting in an unparliamentary way. He said that her use of the word `misled' implied deliberate misleading.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Deputy President said that on the basis that, in introducing the subject matter, Senator Bishop said that Senator Cook was in fact answering a dorothy dix question which he had set up with the intention of maligning the Robe River company. There is no dispute about that. That is in fact what Senator Bishop said; and, I think, what most of us believe. But the Deputy President makes the link that because of the fact that we believe Senator Cook intended to malign Robe River, Senator Bishop was in fact accusing him of deliberately misleading the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having carefully read the Hansard of Senator Bishop's contribution, I think that is an unfair imputation to make. It is not substantiated by the facts of her contribution at all. In fact, it seems that Senator Cook, in setting up this question, had a brief from the Seamen's Union to attack Robe River, which he read into the transcript without independently assessing the facts. It seems, from the information that we have been able to gather, that he put on the record information about Robe River which was incorrect. There has been no suggestion on this side of the chamber by Senator Crane or anyone else that Senator Cook was lying to the Senate, that he was deliberately misleading the Senate. We have no reason to substantiate such an allegation. Our case against Senator Cook is, in fact, that he put down information that was incorrect. He has not been prepared to withdraw it and apologise to the company for giving false information about it. He has damaged the company as a result of that and we intend to pursue the case against him.
       </para>
       <para>
        To say that because of the fact that it was clear that Senator Cook was seeking to malign the company and that Senator Bishop was then claiming that he, by implication, was deliberately misleading the Senate is, I believe, beyond a reasonable interpretation of what she said. I simply ask, in an effort to clear her name in this regard--because, on the material as I read it, the Deputy President, in his finding, imputes a wrong motive--that the Deputy President give some further consideration to his ruling to see whether he wishes to maintain it.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) After polling day at each federal election the certified lists used for marking voters in polling places and those who have recorded declaration votes are electronically scanned and reports produced showing voters who have apparently voted more than once and the electors who have apparently not voted. These reports are then checked for obvious errors such as the occurrence of smudges and marks which have been picked up by the scanner. Those apparent multiple voters remaining on the reports are then sent letters asking them where they voted. The replies from both apparent multiple voters and apparent non-voters are matched to identify those who have had their names marked in error, which accounts for all but a few cases. Through the matching of replies, most apparent multiple voter cases are eliminated and no further action taken.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission regards very seriously any possible cases of multiple voting and instructs its officers that they should not assume polling official error. It is nonetheless considering whether it might be practicable, consistent with its obligations, to identify any of the more obvious cases of polling official error before enquiries are made of voters.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) For Tasmania, the numbers of apparent multiple voters recorded from whom further advice was requested, by electorate, are in the table hereunder. Following investigation by the Australian Electoral Commission of these cases of apparent multiple voting, no cases of admitted multiple voting remained unresolved.

Currently, our agreements with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Canada, Malta and Spain all provide accelerated access to Australia's age pensions (and associated wife and carer pensions) for elderly people from those countries who come to reside in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The agreements also give accelerated access by the same means to invalids and widows who come here to live from agreement countries.  However, these pensions can be obtained by people with limited residence without the help of agreements when the qualifying event occurs here.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) and (2) The quotation cited was from the Policymakers Summary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report `Climate Change--The Scientific Assessment'.
      </para>
      <para>
       To quote the chairman of the IPCC Working Group in the foreword to this IPCC report:
      </para>
      <para>
       `Although, as in any developing scientific topic, there is a minority of opinions which we have not been able to accommodate, the peer review has helped to ensure a high degree of consensus amongst authors and reviewers regarding the results presented. Thus the assessment is an authoritative statement of the views of the international scientific community at this time.'
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to the Second World Climate Conference's endorsement of the IPCC report, the Conference Statement says:
      </para>
      <para>
       `The conference agreed that [the] scientific conclusions set out by the IPCC reflect the international consensus of scientific understanding of climate change'.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are a small minority of scientists who have raised dissenting voices in regard to the IPCC findings on the enhanced greenhouse effect. Some scientists have suggested that the greenhouse effect is less likely to occur than currently accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Others have raised concerns suggesting that there is the possibility of a climate 'surprise' that may lead to much greater impacts.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Industry Commission did make that observation in relation to one of the many scenarios they studied.
      </para>
      <para>
       The quotation should be read in the context that although the results were `broadly comparable', the assumptions and methodology used in arriving at these results were vastly different. The Commission comments on the assumptions the Tasman Institute used to calculate the loss figure on page G26 where they said `the Tasman Institute ... used a tax rate which was about three times higher than the Commission's estimate of the tax required ... [the Tasman] estimate was calculated for the US ... The required rate should be lower in Australia'.
      </para>

       It should also be pointed out that the Industry Commission was comparing two different sorts of figures--`welfare loss' in the case of the Tasman Institute, and `GDP loss' in the case of the Industry Commission. As explained by the Tasman Institute in their paper `Global Warming--Its Economics and Politics', these two measures do not necessarily correspond.

       The Industry Commission recognised the shortcomings of all the estimations of costs and benefits that have been attempted so far when they said:

       `What the Commission's work has shown, however, is that while there is a better basis for estimation of cost effects than climate effects, the complexity of economic interactions, especially when considered over time, are such that it is difficult to be confident about the ability of existing economic models to get it right.' (Page 89)

       These were scenarios, not forecasts. The scenarios studied by the Industry Commission and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics are based on economic models with all the limitations and qualifications of such tools the Industry Commission gave recognition to. The output of such models is a reflection of the methods, assumptions and constraints of such models. The scenarios examined by such models tell us something about the possible results of pursuing a particular policy path, such as the narrow possibility of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions being achieved solely through imposition of a carbon tax as in the Tasman Institute study.

       This is very unlikely to be the policy path followed. Thus work done to date with these models does not inform us as to what is likely to happen in the future.

       In this context the Industry Commission's comments should be noted--`it is difficult to be confident about the ability of existing economic models to get it right' (page 89) and `these results should not be taken to be forecasts' (page 26).

       It should also be pointed out that the ABARE model referred to is now producing very different results with respect to the coal industry, using a different set of assumptions. This reflects the considerable state of flux and uncertainty in economic modelling, even that performed by ABARE, a body with considerable experience in the field.
