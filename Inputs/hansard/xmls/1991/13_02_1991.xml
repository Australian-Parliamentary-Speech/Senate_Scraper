         —My attention has been drawn to a media release issued by Senator McLean yesterday relating to a ruling which I made concerning certain documents which Senator McLean proposed to disclose in the Senate. The media release states that `Westpac Banking Corporation has sought to influence a Presidential ruling'. While the media release does not allege that I have, in fact, been influenced in any improper way, I think I should respond to that suggestion. In my ruling yesterday I made it clear that I had received submissions from Westpac concerning the documents in question and that I had also received a submission from Senator McLean. My ruling was based on a consideration of the merits of these submissions and other advice I received. There was no influence upon me, as the media release might be taken to imply.

       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469,274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

         —I think there are a number of items coming out of this report of the Standing Committee on Procedure that will require a motion to put them before the Senate for debate. There are 10 items in all. Before I move the first one, I will make it quite clear because I think there was some misunderstanding the last time we had a Procedure Committee debate that I am not moving these motions on behalf of the Government; I am simply moving them as Manager of Government Business. When my time comes up for rotation in the chamber my colleagues will follow in doing that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In no way does it suggest that a government imprimatur or a party room decision has been made on any one of these particular motions but we do need an instrument to put them before the Senate. In some cases, I am sure there would have been a pre-discussion within party rooms on some of these matters and on others there would not have been. I would also point out that we would like to expedite these matters as quickly as possible. If there is major disagreement and if there is going to be a long debate, I would very strongly argue that we send it back to the Procedure Committee and see whether we can iron it out further, rather than have a long and useless debate here. We very much seek to change these sort of procedures with a degree of unanimity around the chamber rather than a partisan vote. The first item that comes up is electronic voting. I move:
       </para>
       <para>
        That the Senate take note of this part of the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not speak very long to this particular motion. As I recall, the Procedure Committee did not come to a final determination on electronic voting. A very competent investigation was carried out by the officers of this chamber and various alternatives were put forward, but the Procedure Committee could not come down with a conclusive view. I also note that the other place is looking at this particular matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sorts of issues that come up are: do we have only electronic voting in the chamber and therefore is there much advantage to it? Are we able to record the vote throughout the building and, if so, under what safe conditions, et cetera? I think at the moment the Procedure Committee is erring a little on the side of conservatism. On the one hand I do not think it rules it out. On the other hand, it has not yet seen a system that is compelling in an appealing sense.

         —I contribute very briefly to this debate because we have discussed the subject from time to time. I remember the former Senator Puplick expressing a personal view against electronic voting. In some ways there has been concern that it might detrimentally affect the culture of this place. Like Senator Robert Ray, when I speak on these matters today, I am not formally speaking on behalf of the Opposition. We do not have a whip in these matters, but I think it can be fairly said that improvements in efficiency of the operation of the Senate is something that the Opposition applauds.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, there is another side to this argument. One is the cost of implementing it. We are conscious of the need in these difficult economic times for restraint and we need to demonstrate some of that restraint ourselves. But, probably even more importantly, it is really debatable as to whether there would be a significant advantage, whether there would be a significant saving in time, particularly if it is accepted that the vote should be lodged from within this chamber rather than from within the rooms, and there is a good argument for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, there is quite a strong argument, I believe, in that it brings senators together at the closing stages of a Bill, often at a time when there have been amendments and the amendments may not have been widely appreciated. It has the purpose of perhaps making senators more aware of what they are voting upon. All I am saying at the moment is that it is still a debatable position. I personally support the recommendation of the Committee that in fact it be returned to the Procedure Committee for further consideration.

        <para in-line="1">
         —Several points which Senator Hill has just raised, of course, are really complete furphies. The cost of the electronic voting would be substantially less than the costs at present, for the simple reason that at the moment when the buttons are pushed by senators, not only would the votes be automatically tallied and put up on a screen behind the President's chair somewhere for everybody to see, but also the names of the particular people who were voting would also be revealed there and could be automatically recorded into Hansard. So the voting could in fact occur over a very, very short interval of time and therefore very considerable savings would occur.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is unfortunate that it seems some members in this place are not aware of the enormous power of electronic devices these days. The real reason that the Government and the Opposition are not too happy with this is that voting would have to occur with each senator sitting in his or her place. One can imagine the difficulty which the parties, with such tight control of their members, would face with their members wanting to vote for or against particular motions without actually physically dividing and crossing the floor.
       </para>
       <para>
        The lack of understanding which members of both the Government and the Opposition show with respect to particular matters being voted upon is quite clear very often in this chamber. We in the Australian Democrats have all had the experience of members of both the Government and the Opposition coming in saying, `What are we voting on? What is this all about? Which side do we go?' One can imagine, if one had electronic voting and all senators had to sit in their own place and press a button, the confusion which would reign in this place in terms of the votes.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, of course, the up side of that would be that every senator in this place would have to responsibly understand what it was he or she was voting on and cast a deliberate, deliberative vote, and that would be one of its principal advantages. For that reason, we would suggest that it be looked at very closely. But it is precisely-and I am putting my finger right on it here-the reason that neither the Government nor the Opposition is keen to have it. They both rely on a very tight party system in which most of their members simply behave like sheep and vote according to the one or two who determine how they will vote.

         —Senator Robert Ray has asked for a very brief debate. I could not agree with him more but that absolute rubbish we have just heard unfortunately inspired me to get to my feet. I have never heard such rubbish. If any caucusing is done, it is done in the Australian Democrats. How very rarely do they ever divide their vote. They are caucused stronger than any other group. Indeed, they organise themselves when they are in this situation of the public being divided outside and then say amongst themselves, `Okay, we can rectify this. We will have two over there and three over here'. They caucus themselves more than any other group in this place, more than any other party. Indeed, we have witnessed that they never listen to debate, as they profess to do, because their minds are made up well before they enter this place.

        Mr Deputy President, as you well know, the Liberal Party of Australia senators have the opportunity on every Bill to cross the floor and vote according to their consciences, and they have done so on many, many occasions. Senator Coulter said that senators come in here and say, `What are we voting on?'. How ridiculous! The Australian Democrats do not even bother to ask. They look where their leader is and off they wander.

        This is likely to generate probably a little more debate and passion than some of the other motions. To some extent there are two competing principles running side by side, both of which one would like to endorse-that is, the general principle that in camera evidence not be disclosed because, if in the end, it is realised that disclosure is likely, we can give away in camera evidence as no-one will come and give it, and a lot of committee work and its effectiveness will be debilitated. On the other hand, we have the principle involved of the rights of minorities and whether we can ever allow a majority to overrule a minority from putting forward its views. That is also a very strong principle. We have had those two principles running neck and neck throughout all this and quite often the debate overlapping and getting confused between the two principles. At the same time, overlapping all that, we have had some very partisan issues which also overlap into this whole debate. The Standing Committee on Procedure considered all this-

        So, Mr Deputy President, as I say, I have not been centrally involved in these particular arguments. The principle being most pushed by the motion that I have moved is the paramountcy of protecting in camera evidence. I do acknowledge that other principles run through this, and measuring them and balancing them off is not an easy task. That is a task which I charge the Senate with this morning. I hope the debate can be approached in a more detached way maybe than some of the previous discussions around this particular issue. I hope that people do not bring up history too much and that we do not divide on the basis of `because that has been brought up we will all tribalise and go off in our own particular directions'.

         —I would like to start this debate off. I think it is going to be a very long one. As Senator Robert Ray said, it certainly is a very vexed question. Committees always prefer to take evidence in public on the public record. Witnesses appearing before committees are always advised that that is the preferred course. But there are times when the wishes of the witness and the interests of the committee are best served by preserving some degree of confidentiality on the evidence given. That then becomes in camera evidence.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Witnesses have never had the right to demand that in camera evidence stays in camera or secret. On all the committees on which I have served, witnesses have always been advised by the chairman that there is no absolute control over the evidence once it has been given but that every process will be taken to try to guarantee that it remains confidential. The difficulty for a committee arises when the report has to be written. While Senate committees tend to be apolitical, they are not always apolitical and objective. But, apart from that, there is the possibility of genuine dissent amongst the members of the committee. If a member of a committee feels that he cannot agree with the majority of the report, he puts in a dissenting report. He is quite allowed to do this under the Standing Orders. That dissenting report is not subjected to investigation or approval in any way at all by the committee chairman or the rest of the committee. It is the right of the dissenting senator to make that report and to have it attached to the report of the committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        A central part of the dissent or a supporting part of the argument which leads the senator to dissent may be based on in camera evidence. If he cannot refer to that evidence the argument looks weak; it looks hypothetical; it looks unconvincing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have served on committees in this Senate for 13 years. I have never been in the position where I had to use in camera evidence to support a dissenting report. In fact, I have been party to very few dissenting reports on the committees on which I have served. But I can see that it is a reality and the problem for the Senate is to overcome this difficulty when evidence is given. While the majority of the committee may not accept that evidence as being germane to the conclusions of the committee, there is a very real case for that dissenting member to have the right to use that information.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is more than the right of the committee to have a report on the table that reflects both the majority and minority point of view; it is the right of the Parliament to gain information which is an absolutely fundamental issue in our democratic system. This Parliament is the highest court in the land.
       </para>
       <para>
        About the only point in Senator Ray's opening remarks that I would differ with is the claim he made that we ought to give away in camera evidence. That simply is not possible because many of the terms of appointment under which the more important committees and the major committees of this Parliament and this Senate are set up contain words which in effect allow the committee to summon witnesses and documents to appear before it. Translated into plain English, it means that those committees which have this power as the term of their appointment have the right to call before them any witness, whether it is a public servant or a private individual and compel that person to give evidence. If that power of compulsion is involved it then becomes illogical for us to say in the lesser case, where administratively it is convenient, `We cannot have in camera evidence'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I support the basic contention that we should not use in camera evidence except where it is really necessary. At the end of the day, although we caution the witnesses that the committee may choose to publish in camera evidence, there is another practical problem involved in maintaining secrecy; that is, simply the fact that the evidence given is always printed in Hansard. We all have staff in our offices, and we all have visitors. Hansards arrive in our offices from committees and they have `In Camera Evidence' or some declaration on the front cover which indicates that they are confidential. When one has been around for a number of years, there will be a heap of these on the shelves and, with the best will in the world, it is very hard to maintain security and confidentiality. The possibility that in camera evidence can leak out is very real. In my personal experience, the only way that can be avoided-this is the case on one committee I am on, the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation-is to have a safe and lock up the material. That is certainly not the general practice throughout the Parliament, and I do not believe it is a practical way to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        I support the view of my colleagues on the Procedure Committee. I must say that the vote was won by the narrowest of margins; it was won by the traditional margin of the Government having one vote more than the other members on the Committee. The view of those who dissented with the Procedure Committee report is incorporated on page 4. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A dissenting Senator who wishes to refer to in camera evidence should advise the committee of the evidence concerned, and all reasonable effort should be made by the committee to reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for that purpose. If agreement is not reached, the dissenting Senator may refer to the in camera evidence in the dissent only to the extent necessary to support the reasoning of the dissent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is some months since we debated this in the Procedure Committee meeting, and on reflection I am more convinced that that is the reasonable approach this chamber should take. We should take every step we can on committees to restrict the amount of in camera evidence collected, but where it is collected and there is a genuine dissent, then I believe it is impossible to deny the dissenting member of the committee access to that information because it forms an essential part of his argument. Furthermore, it strikes at the fundamental principle of the right of the Parliament and for the Parliament's substitute, the people of Australia, to know, through the medium of committee inquiries, what is going on in the country with the issues that are so important that they are before the committee for investigation. On those grounds, I believe that the Senate has no option but to support the view that is incorporated on page 4 of the Procedure Committee report.

        No doubt, in some areas there are matters which should be kept confidential. I refer to the secrecy provisions of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which have given rise to a lot of comment both within the Committee and in public in recent months. It is quite clear that if the National Crime Authority Committee is to continue its work, then the secrecy provisions must be lifted. At the same time, it is also clear that in this way some of the information could reach the public and could be detrimental to the administration of justice in the country and to the rights of individuals. The way out is to amend the legislation and to ensure that certain types of information, which in this way could be detrimental to either individuals or the administration of justice, are kept confidential by law rather than by the decision of the Executive Government in committee.

         —I strongly support the motion moved by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). I object to the whole concept of in camera evidence because I think there is a problem receiving it. What is the use of getting in camera evidence if that evidence cannot be used? That is one of the problems that we have. If we hear evidence in camera, how can we put it out of our minds and not let it colour our thinking?

        Senator Crichton-Browne referred to his judgment that certain evidence taken in camera does not deserve to be in camera. What a ridiculous position to take. If the committee makes a decision that evidence should be taken in camera, that is the decision of the committee. One can argue in theory that the evidence does not belong to an individual senator who is a member of the committee, but belongs to the committee and, through the committee, to the Senate, so it ought to be the committee or the Senate which makes a decision about the use of the information.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been on committees and I have chaired committees in the past when evidence has been taken in camera, and I am totally convinced by that experience that taking evidence in camera is more trouble than it is worth. Senator Reid is reported in the Procedure Committee report as suggesting that she would like the Senate to consider the question of requiring a witness's consent before publishing in camera evidence. I understand that position. However, at the same time she is one of those reported as supporting the alternative proposal, which allows the committee to go ahead and publish evidence after the witnesses have had a chance to give their opinion about the release of evidence they have given in camera.
       </para>
       <para>
        In answer to Senator Spindler, the proposal moved by the Minister includes the option of the committee or the Senate giving permission for evidence to be released so that, if one has a situation where the majority on the committee acts unreasonably, the minority on the committee can always come in here, raise it in the Senate and overcome the fact that the numbers in the Senate are not reflected in the numbers on the committee.

It does not have to be actually talked about in the chamber. We are not getting into a situation like that we nearly got into last night. I think we just have to accept the situation that the committee structure is as it is; that is, for all the time that committees have existed, government has had an effective majority on the committees but that the committee can be overridden by a decision of the Senate.

         —Yes, I am a problem. I will wear that accusation with honour, coming from Senator MacGibbon. Senator Crichton-Browne produced a minority report on the Kakadu inquiry. In that instance not only did he go ahead and publish evidence that had the status of being in camera; he also did not even provide the committee with an opportunity to argue against him or go to the extent of consulting the witnesses concerned. At least the alternative proposal, which I presume Senator Hill will move, would now provide some sort of protection in that it suggests that a dissenting senator who wishes to refer to in camera evidence should advise the committee, that all reasonable efforts should be made to reach agreement and that witnesses should, as far as practicable, be informed in advance and given reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure. If we adopted that, it would at least prevent the sort of action that Senator Crichton-Browne took a couple of years ago.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I emphasise that I would take the view-and I presume the Opposition in all its strictness about these things would also take the view-that the evidence is the property of the committee and, through the committee, of the Senate, and is not the property of an individual member of the committee to make a unilateral decision to reveal merely because, in the terms Senator Crichton-Browne used, he does not agree in the first place that the evidence deserved to be in camera-those were his words-or that the evidence is so compelling that it must be used in support of a dissenting report. I emphasise that the proposal which has been moved argues that permission of the committee or the Senate ought to be required. The main point is that, unless that provision is adopted, there ought to be no more taking of in camera evidence because I think it is unreasonable to those who give such evidence that they have no assurance that even the whole committee will do anything to protect that evidence. I strongly support the option moved by the Minister.

I do so for a couple of reasons which I would like to put on the record. Prima facie, the processes by which we operate in society are those of open government and open courts. If a witness gives evidence in court, that evidence is taken in public. Public galleries are provided to enable the public to see what is going on and to listen to what is said. In the debate today we have a gallery with some people in it. Having heard the brilliant speeches made so far, I think it is a pity that more people are not in the gallery to hear them. However, there is a gallery open to the public so that people can see what is going on here and take account of it.

       <para>
        I cannot think of any situation where witnesses as a rule are heard in camera. The Executive conducts its proceedings in camera, but that is where it considers things and no witnesses are called. Why should we not accept as a primary proposition that whatever evidence is called should be heard in the open? If one is sitting on a committee and one is to use evidence to support a proposition-no matter what the proposition might be and what evidence would support tentatively the conclusions one might have-one should draw that evidence from the witnesses.

        In that case, if the committee wants to put that proposition before the public, if it wants to talk about national security on the basis of evidence that it wants to obtain, it should obtain that evidence in the open. It seems absurd, as Senator Coates has said, that the Opposition wants to make these statements. We had a great illustration last night when Senator McLean, I would have thought, in what he was doing, was supporting the proposition that some of us are now opposing-those of us who do oppose it; I am supporting it. One could say, `Look, there is a balance to be struck and we forbid you, as a senator, to do what you want. We say that the Senate should, in those circumstances, override the individual'. As Senator Coates has said, that is what this proposition does.

If we want to take evidence for an inquiry, for a submission, that we have to make public, then we should take that evidence in public. If we want to have a secret inquiry and deliver a secret proposition to someone, I can follow what the honourable senator says, but I would have thought it was terribly dangerous to go into in camera evidence for a start. Without putting too fine a point on it, it has a star chamber quality about it, where people give evidence in secret and action is suddenly taken in public with the statement that it is based on evidence which we have taken in camera. That is a dangerous proposition for the sort of society we want to live in.

Having induced it, drawn it out, by this mechanism, by this device, we could then throw it open to the public. Why not tell the person, `We are going to use this evidence and you must give it.'? If the committee thinks it is proper, then it ought to insist on it rather than letting the witness give it on the false assumption that it is not going to be made public and then make it public. The courts do this every day. Many people do not want to give evidence. The courts insist they give it in public. If a committee thinks that it is proper that evidence be given, it should insist that it be given in the public arena. If we do not, as senators, have enough nous, enough ability, to get the evidence in a legitimate and proper way, then it behoves us to raise our game and not to lurk, as it were, in the secrecy of some closed chamber to get evidence out of people which is then revealed to the public gaze, to their detriment-whether by making them open to investigation by ridiculing their character, by bringing their character to disrepute, or even by embarrassing them.

If it is so important that evidence be kept secret and not revealed to the public-this is what we were saying to Senator McLean last night-then we ought to say so and not use it.

         —Along with Senator Spindler, I am thankful that Senator Robert Ray's contribution at the commencement of this debate pointed out that the two competing principles we are looking at are, on the one hand, the protection of in camera evidence and the willingness of people to come forward and give that evidence and, on the other hand, the rights of minorities. I would like to add to that by putting two points. Firstly, it may well be the case that the Parliament relies on some people coming forward, privately ringing up a committee secretary or one of the committee members and saying, `I have some information your Committee might like to have. It is very sensitive information and I would like to give it in camera'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If there is an extensive misuse of in camera evidence, it is possible that those sorts of people will not come forward. I can see that. In any event it is not my view that there has been a misuse of in camera evidence, so I do not think that we can look at the history and say that this Parliament or this chamber has led the community to believe that Parliament cannot be trusted. Sure, there have been occasions when in camera evidence has been released. Sure, there have been some that I would not agree with and there would be some that those opposite would not agreed with. But I do not think that by and large the Australian community has formed the view that Parliament cannot be trusted with the information given to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not see a need-nobody has raised it with me-for greater protection of in camera evidence in the first place. No-one has made a case for misuse of in camera evidence. I can think of examples that some might like to use. I would be happy to have more extensive debate with them on those matters on another day. I simply make the point that there is not a view in the community that Parliament cannot be trusted. That case has not been made.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to extend the other principle mentioned by Senator Robert Ray about the rights of minorities being protected and say that, while that is one element of the other side of the case, the element that is missing, if it is phrased simply as `We have to protect the rights of minorities to speak', is that we have to protect the role of Parliament controlling the Executive. That is really what gets cut off if the Executive is given the power to control what information Parliament has. I see that as part of my job. We are all elected here by the same quota in our respective States and we are all elected to contribute to watching what the Executive is doing and calling it to answer for its actions, either in the past or intended expenditures in the future. That is the role that we all have here.
       </para>
       <para>
        What complicates this is that we do not have a system such as that in the United States of America where the Executive is outside Parliament. Some in here are members of the Executive and they do not serve on these committees. But the sad fact is that more and more with the two and one-tenth party system, more and more members of parliament who are members of the party which holds government feel obliged to follow the wishes of their Executive. It certainly happens on the other side of Parliament more than it does on this side of Parliament, but I do not pretend that it does not happen on this side. There is a very strong expectation and substantial pressure on the members of the party in government to support what their government, the Executive, wants to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Parliament sets up these committees. We already give the party that has government in the lower House the majority on those committees. I would have thought that that was already a pretty good slice given to those who by and large would support the Executive. A case has not been made out to reduce further the powers available to those who oppose the Executive-whether they be members of the party in government, the party in opposition, the Australian Democrats or the Independents-or to further neuter the role that parliamentarians can play in scrutinising the Executive. It is not just a simple case of protecting in camera evidence and the rights of minorities. This is just another chink in the armour of Parliament; another protecting wall around the Executive.
       </para>
       <para>
        The case has been put by speakers I think on both sides that there should by and large be a preference to hear all evidence in public. I agree with that. There should be very rare exceptions to this when this Parliament shifts under what one of Senator Crowley's colleagues in the lower House, Mr Melham, refers to as `the cover of darkness'. That is the kind of terminology that Mr Melham likes to use. But they are very rare occasions. We should think very carefully before we shut the doors and say to the public, `You are not seeing the work that your Parliament is doing'. To that extent, I agree with Senator Coates and speakers on the other side who have made that point.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there are a number of problems. There are some committees for whom that is simply not practicable. For example, it is simply not practicable for the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to hold a large number of its hearings in public. We have been doing so at the moment for the evaluation of the National Crime Authority (NCA). That has been a good and productive exercise. It is not yet finished. Members of the public, journalists, academics and anybody else with a view have been invited to come forward and put their views on the operation of the NCA. And they have done that in public. That has been a good exercise for the Parliament, the Committee and, with the greatest respect for it, the Authority. However, when the Committee is engaging in its normal task, the task which it is primarily charged with, that is, overseeing the functions of the Authority, it is simply not practicable to say, `We'll have an open hearing' and every 10 minutes have someone from the Authority say, `Now I want to tell you something that relates to a matter that shouldn't be revealed to the public' and then shut the hearing down again. By and large, that Committee hears nearly all its evidence in camera.
       </para>
       <para>
        Owing to other problems that arise from the drafting of the National Crime Authority Act, referred to by Senator Spindler earlier, previously constituted NCA committees have not always had meetings that they thought were productive. I do not think that they were told anything at some of these meetings that should not have been on the public record. But of course those meetings are held as private meetings and the evidence is treated as in camera evidence so as to protect the flow of information, such as it is, between the Authority and the Committee. If the Authority wants to say something that it prefers that the public not hear about, it can. That is a sensible way for that Committee to operate-to have all its hearings with the Authority in camera so as to protect that evidence which should be treated that way; otherwise we would be chopping and changing from one minute to the next.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where does that put a member of the NCA Committee when a report is produced and the member wants to release some of that information, which is in a legalistic sense in camera evidence but is not evidence that, if the Committee were able to consider bit by bit, would be given the imprimatur of in camera evidence; in other words, it is totally inconsequential to the operation of the NCA or any of its witnesses or whatever? This evidence might relate simply to the administration or maladministration of that body. That evidence is in camera evidence. Under the proposals put forward by the Government a senator would have to seek permission from the government members of the National Crime Authority Committee to release that information.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether my view is appropriate I do not know but I have formed the view that, on one occasion had the Government members been able to read a dissenting report, they would have simply decided not to report. Without wanting to colour it too much, I say that that is the tyranny of the Executive, which has the capacity to decide that, if it does not want Parliament to know something, it will simply refuse to report. There is then no dissenting report in which, for instance, I, Senator Spindler or Senator Bell can air our views. What does a senator then do? It is a dreadful situation. The Government is suggesting that we come in here and ask the chamber whether this information can be released.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last night we saw Senator McLean stumbling along trying to get permission from the Senate to release some information, without his being able to tell us what information he wanted released. That is exactly the situation every senator will be put in when he or she wants to release some in camera evidence. Senators will have to come to this chamber, make a case for releasing A, B or C, without telling the Senate what A, B and C are. It is an almost impossible task and a fence should not be put around senators in that way.
       </para>
       <para>
        My case relates to the position of a senator who believes a committee has in its possession material of which Parliament should be aware and about which the committee says, `No, there is no need to tell Parliament that', or, `We do not want to tell Parliament that'. That will put senators in a very difficult position. They will have to fight an uphill battle to tell Parliament what they have found out, possibly about what the Executive is doing. The reason senators have such a difficult task is that primarily the majority on the committee is held by members of the party which forms the Executive. With the best goodwill in the world, it simply will not work. The Executive will say, `This is too embarrassing. We are not going to release this information'. It will drum up every reason under the sun as to why the information should not be released.
       </para>
       <para>
        My friend Senator Cooney says, `Why take the evidence in camera if you then intend to make it public, tarnish people's reputations, embarrass them, and heaven knows what?'. There is a very good reason why, on limited occasions, we should take evidence in camera. A person putting forward the evidence may believe that it will put somebody's life, limb or reputation at risk. Surely when a witness comes before a Senate committee and says, `I have something to tell you but I think that it will put somebody's life, limb or reputation at risk', the committee would not refuse the opportunity of hearing that person in camera so that it can weigh up the effect of the evidence that is offered.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taking evidence in camera allows a committee time to reflect on what the person will say. It gives the committee the opportunity of depriving a public forum to those who would come before it to unfairly malign somebody's character. In other words, it gives the committee some discretion to consider the matter and then, after proper reflection, to release the information that the Parliament needs. I say that Parliament needs to know--

         —At the moment I am referring to the whole committee. When I say that Parliament needs to know, I do not mean that the only information that a committee should put before Parliament is that which it needs. It allows the committee to decide which information would, if released, put somebody's life, limb or reputation at risk. That is the reason normal Senate committees, other than the security related ones which should have more frequent access to in camera evidence, should take evidence in camera.

       <para>
        I have already put forward the view that I have been a part of a committee whose report was issued last year, which had attached to it a dissenting report that contained some in camera evidence. I and the other signatories to that dissenting report put up, I think quite patiently, with an enormous amount of abuse from certain members of parliament for having taken such a course. I do not want to rehash the whole matter, though I would be happy to do so if the Senate wishes. However, it does not seem germane to this debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am simply saying that I do not think there is one piece of information or evidence released in the dissenting report relating to the National Crime Authority (NCA) on Operation Ark which should not or could not have been taken in public. There was nothing in there that related to an operational matter of the NCA at all. That evidence was taken in camera only because that is the way in which the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority needs to meet to function properly, and to provide the opportunity for very sensitive material to be given over. All material is heard in camera. All that report did was to show what a disastrous case of maladministration was going on in South Australia. I defy anyone to tell me why this Parliament ought not know that. It is a ridiculous situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that senators on the other side involved in that particular NCA report were quick to jump to their feet and say what a dreadful deed had been done. I do not think that it was dreadful to tell Parliament what it ought to know. But there has been a peculiar silence since the Brisbane meeting of that Committee. At that meeting the Chairman of the Committee did something inadvertently, I believe. I attribute no bad faith to him, at least in this respect; and I do not say that to mean that I attribute bad faith in any other respect either. I simply qualify my remark to mean that it was not a blanket endorsement of Mr Lindsay. I say that to clarify my position. I am trying to do Mr Lindsay a favour by saying that I believe it was inadvertent. On a number of occasions during a public hearing-with cameras, recorders and everything else present-he proceeded to quote from some in camera evidence of the Committee. It was not evidence taken when I was on the Committee-I think it was a couple of years ago. I could not give the date; it does not matter. The evidence was taken by a previously constituted parliamentary committee on the NCA.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had a witness before us and Mr Lindsay said, `Well, in 1900-and-blah you said blah. Let me read it to you, let me quote it'. It was colourful language, basically. Pretty well on each occasion the witness looked a bit embarrassed and said, `Well, I might not use language like that now, but the substance of what I said then is still my view', or words to that effect. The witness looked a little uncomfortable about this. I pointed out to the Secretary that my copy of this previous evidence had `In Camera' stamped all over it. I asked whether anything had happened in the meantime that made the evidence no longer in camera. My understanding is that the only time one can release in camera evidence is in a report or a dissenting report, certainly not just on an adjournment debate, at a public hearing or whatever.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having had this pointed out, the Chairman did not raise the matter with me and, as I understand it-and I have spoken to Senator Spindler about it-he did not raise it with Senator Spindler. It was a bit difficult because the only people meeting on that occasion were myself, Senator Loosley and the Chairman-we were meeting as a sub-committee. Following the morning tea break, I was indisposed for five or six minutes. I farewelled Senator Loosley and the Chairman and said, `I am going to the bathroom. I will be back in about six minutes'. During that time this witness was called back and was told, I understand, that the Committee had decided his evidence should be made public. He was asked whether he had any objections. He said that he had no objection. So, not just the paragraphs that had been quoted by Mr Lindsay but the evidence holus bolus was then printed up and released for publication. This was something that was done inadvertently, by mistake, I believe. But if we want to talk about courtesies to committee members, no courtesy was shown. I read that the Chairman told this witness that the Committee `had decided'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since this hearing I have been waiting for the Chairman to explain to members of the Committee how he osmosed their views into his mind-it certainly was not by a formal meeting of the Committee, there were only four people there. That subcommittee was not charged with the responsibility of deciding whether in camera evidence would be released or not, and the release of that evidence has caused some difficulty for a number of people. I was not there when this happened-Senator Loosley might be able to explain-but I understand that at some Sydney hearings someone who got hold of this in camera evidence wanted to take it a little further.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we want to talk about what is going to happen with in camera evidence, and how careful we have to be with it, I would like to hear from some Government members about why there has been no explanation about what happened with this particular matter in relation to the NCA Committee. It is an absolutely disastrous situation-I hesitate to say it is an appalling situation-where the Chairman of a committee says to a witness that the committee has decided something and the committee, clearly, has not decided that. I hesitate to say that it is an even more appalling situation when such a mess-up is made that the Chairman, on numerous occasions since then, has declined the opportunity to explain to the Committee what a mess-up he has made of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, I think the occasions on which in camera evidence is taken should be very rare. For some committees it is simply not practicable to do that regularly, and I use the NCA Committee as an example.
       </para>
       <para>
        My view is that the judgment of what should come before parliament should be made by individual senators. There should be no need to go and ask the majority. We all know that, by and large, the majority will go along with the Executive and we expect that to be the case. Executive control of the committees means that those committees will not inform parliament as properly as they should, and as properly as they now can, of what parliament ought to know.
       </para>
       <para>
        The alternative proposed by the Procedure Committee-not by the Government-is too much of an uphill battle. To come into the chamber and get permission to release A, B and C, without being able to tell the chamber what A, B and C is, is absolutely fanciful.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by reminding honourable senators that we are all elected by the same proportion of people in our States. We are all charged with the responsibility of making decisions about when information should come before parliament and when it should not. This should not be the task of the majority of the committee at all; it is the responsibility of each honourable senator, and that is the way it should be left.

         —I rise to support the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Procedure to deal with this vexed question of in camera evidence. It is vexed because, clearly, the procedures at the moment are not working effectively. There is a degree of confusion about the manner in which committees are operating and ought to operate, and about the manner in which evidence may be released in reports to the Senate. If we look at the practical circumstance now, there is no doubt in my mind that we do require some sensible proposals for change. I believe that in the proposals before the Senate this morning, those reasonable proposals have emerged.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Currently, we have the circumstance in which committees do take evidence in camera, but the procedure is far from satisfactory; indeed, I go so far as to say that it is most unsatisfactory. No guarantee may be given on behalf of a committee to the witness involved that confidentiality will be respected; no guarantee can be given to the witness before the committee that the material being furnished to the committee in its deliberations, supposedly classified as in camera, will not appear at some future stage in a majority or dissenting report. That, obviously, leads to a conclusion whereby people will feel inhibited about the material which they are able to give to the committee. That really is unsatisfactory in terms of making sure that deliberations are thorough and founded on exhaustive examination of evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently, given the fact that no guarantee may be given to a witness, the term `in camera' means absolutely nothing. There is no process guaranteeing confidentiality; there is no practical application of the term-the term has no practical effect. As a matter of fact, as a Senate, we now have the worst of all worlds. It is unfair to witnesses; it is confusing for witnesses and for committee personnel. As a matter of fact, it reduces the procedures of Senate committees-indeed, of joint committees-to something akin to farce. How can bodies take in camera evidence and then find a day, a week or a month later that the material has found its way onto the public record for whatever reason?
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposition that has come from the Procedure Committee, as outlined by Senator Robert Ray and supported by Senator Coates and Senator Cooney, endeavours to address these dilemmas. It addresses the dilemmas in three succinct parts. I would argue to the Senate this morning that the manner in which the Procedure Committee has chosen to address matters is fair, it is reasonable and it is practical.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first part of the recommendation addresses the need for confidentiality. I would not have thought that that was in doubt anywhere in the chamber. Earlier I think Senator Newman raised the issue of national security. It is a fair point. There are going to be occasions where there will be a need for secrecy and for the attendant responsibility for matters of grave concern affecting, say, the administration of justice, the defence forces, international obligations and, from time to time, perhaps even commercial matters in confidence. No-one doubts that from time to time there will be a need for confidentiality.

        In terms of current circumstances, witnesses have no clear idea of what they are able to say, and the material they are able to furnish in absolute confidence. If the Procedure Committee's recommendations are adopted witnesses will, indeed, know precisely the basis on which they are giving evidence, they will know precisely where they stand, and that is a dramatic change from the present.

       <para>
        As a serving member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority-and I have no wish to canvass again issues that have been raised about the NCA Committee in the chamber-I think there is no doubt that, from time to time, the Committee would be best served by ensuring that any person with material to assist the Committee in its deliberations is prepared to come forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        The NCA Committee, as with other committees of the Parliament-the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and committees on defence and foreign affairs-by virtue of their charters and their obligations are required to deal with extraordinarily sensitive matters. We simply cannot have a situation in which witnesses may be deterred from coming forward to give evidence to the Parliament. For reasons of personal safety, witnesses may be frightened of coming forward and may be deterred from coming forward on the basis of potential retribution either in their professions, occupations, or in their personal circumstances. In that respect it is simply untenable to argue that this is a matter whereby the recommendations would serve solely to protect the interests of Executive Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Within the Westminster system there is a long and honourable tradition of whistle blowers, people who have identified problems in administration, and from time to time maladministration. We will not have the whistle blowers coming forward if this situation of confusion about in camera evidence is allowed to continue. It is also fair comment that the recommendations from the Procedure Committee are practical. They lay down clear and comprehensive guidelines-guidelines that are currently lacking.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recommendations build a mechanism for the advice of witnesses prior to giving evidence. If the recommendations are adopted by the Senate today we will not have a circumstance in which in camera evidence can be disclosed in the future on whim or capriciously. The only means by which in camera evidence can be disclosed will be by agreement after a process of deliberation. If we look through the recommendations, we see that that process is exhaustive. That process will occur on the basis of a series of decisions after evaluation by the people concerned, the people who serve on the committee-not only from the Government but from the Opposition parties, the Democrats and Independents-and there is provision to involve the witnesses concerned as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        The procedure sets down a clear means by which senators, whether from Government or Opposition, can use sensitive material in a dissenting report. That option is not closed. As a matter of fact, the option becomes available on the basis of agreement. An avenue is established for achieving the capacity to sustain an argument in a dissenting report with the use of in camera evidence. That is not something that is available to any senator by agreement at the moment. I find that procedure absolutely reasonable. Even where agreement cannot be reached, there is provision in these recommendations for advancing an argument without breaching confidence-in other words, without breaching consideration of honour, the capacity is still there to mount and sustain an argument.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sorry that Senator Vanstone had to leave the chamber for another commitment. She was good enough to pass me a note apologising for that. I did want to take up one or two points that she made and to take issue with them by way of the arguments. I said earlier that I was grateful for the intervention by Senator Crichton-Browne as to whether a problem exists. A problem does exist. If a problem did not exist we would not be having this debate this morning to address the circumstance. It does not require a circumstance of extensive abuse or misuse of in camera evidence. In fact, the contrary applies. As the Senate knows only too well, a single instance of misuse or abuse of in camera evidence causes a problem to develop. A single instance whereby the use of in camera evidence is challenged in the chamber causes a problem to develop. Putting the most generous interpretation on the use of in camera evidence in the Parliament to date, it is fair to say that that use of in camera evidence has been challenged at an absolute minimum.
       </para>
       <para>
        A single instance only whereby in camera evidence is used and called into question creates a problem. The problem goes beyond the simple argument here today. It serves to jeopardise confidence in the workings of the committee system of the Parliament, the joint committees and the Senate standing committees. Frankly, that is too precious to place in jeopardy. It is not only something of which this chamber can be proud; it is something of which parliamentary democracy can be proud. In my view, it has to be guarded very jealously. That confidence in our system needs to be maintained.
       </para>

        To date there is no question in my mind that the use of in camera evidence will cause some witnesses to be wary. I see that on the NCA Committee, for example. The Chairman, Mr Lindsay-I will say one or two other words about Mr Lindsay in a moment-advises witnesses of the circumstances in which they are giving evidence to the Committee and draws their attention to the fact that, while there is provision for in camera evidence to be taken, no guarantee of confidentiality may be given by the Committee. There is no doubt that that has an impact. It just causes people to be more guarded in what they say. I do not think that is particularly healthy. It is simply a matter of human nature rather than procedure.

        Senator Vanstone spoke at length about Executive Government, scrutiny of Executive Government and the need to make certain that there are not problems of maladministration. I can agree with a number of things that she said. I do not see this debate as a matter of Executive Government as against the Parliament. I do not see this as a matter of partisanship or of a definition on party lines. While, in my view, it has nothing to do with partisanship, it does have everything to do with the effective working of our committee system. Given the range of obligations of the Australian Parliament, that is something that must be maintained in excellent working order. I think that the recommendations of the Procedure Committee before us today serve to enhance our capacity to achieve that objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recommendations also have everything to do with establishing reasonable procedures and with guaranteeing fair play-fair not only to the Parliament and to individual senators but also fair to people who appear before committees and who participate in their deliberations. I wanted to make the point at this stage about care and responsibility. That comes back to the obligations of members of parliament.

        In terms of the Committee on the NCA, I was present at the meeting in Brisbane to which Senator Vanstone referred. There was a decision of the Committee to release some evidence taken a couple of years earlier. That was done with the agreement of the witness; it was done at the request of the Chair; it was done openly; and I do not believe it excites the controversy to which Senator Vanstone alluded.

        A short while ago I had the opportunity of speaking briefly with Senator Watson, who raised a point earlier in the debate and privately with me about the need for consistency-and I think he is absolutely right. He drew attention to the procedures of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which are very clear, very strict and very comprehensive and, in my brief experience on that Committee and from what other people who have had a much longer period of service on the PAC have told me, are seen to work.

I understand that Senator Watson is drafting an amendment which would give practical effect to the suggestion he has made and that there would be a very strict procedure for the release of in camera evidence on the basis of agreement with the Committee and agreement with the witness. This would put matters beyond doubt and that is certainly an amendment to which the Senate ought to give particularly careful consideration given that that would define the procedure in a very comprehensive sense.

        In summation, I do not believe that this vexed question can simply be left to individual senators or to individual witnesses. It has to be a collective responsibility of the Parliament, of every senator, of every committee and of everyone who participates in the committee process. It is a matter whereby we need to establish a deliberate and fair procedure. The Procedure Committee has outlined precisely that. It involves the witnesses, it involves senators and it involves the committees. If we adopt the recommendations that are before us, if we look to the kind of outcome that Senator Watson is suggesting, we will not need to have this debate in the future; there will be an agreed procedure, the business of the Parliament will be improved, the deliberative process of the committees will be improved and we will not have the controversy that we have had over recent times. That controversy has not served the interests of anyone, be that person an individual senator from the Government or from the Opposition, or of the Parliament itself.

         —I do not claim to be perfect. Senator Coates claimed, in a rather impertinent and uninformed way, that I had released in camera evidence improperly without the consent of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure, which goes to the heart of the arrogance of the argument put by the Government, and that I had not consulted the witnesses, which again goes to the impertinence of the Government because there is no provision for either. Senator Coates cannot cope with a minority report. It is always the left wing libertarians, who claim to be the social conscience of individuals, who trample on them the first moment they dare utter independence.

        I go for a moment to the matters which first precipitated this debate. This debate was caused by Senator Zakharov referring this item to the Procedure Committee and it flows from the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into the resource potential of the Kakadu National Park. During that inquiry the Committee took evidence from the elders of the Jawoyn people. They included the senior elders-Nipper Brown, Sandy Barraway and Peter Jatbula and those who were identified as being the responsible elders. That hearing, notwithstanding the ignorance in which Senator Coates continues to bask, was not in camera. It was a private meeting to the extent that it was meant to help the witnesses, not to hide their evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were concerned to ensure that the right environment existed to allow the elders to feel relaxed, comfortable and confident in their presentation. We said to them that we would discourage the public from trampling on the hearing and that they should feel free because it would be only them and us. It was not in camera, it was not intended that their evidence should not be made public; it was intended simply to create the right environment so they should feel confident when they were giving the evidence-something that most sensitive people would understand, not the arrogant and the ignorant perhaps. That was the basis of the decision that evidence was never given in camera.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I used part of that evidence to support my minority report there was much outrage by members of the Government, fundamentally because the majority of the report was not substantiated by the evidence but the minority report was. That caused some heartache, some embarrassment and some anxiety on the part of the Government. I did not disclose all of the evidence. I disclosed that which was relevant to the prosecution of my argument. However, on 5 June 1989 on pages 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the Hansard we can see where Senator Zakharov sought permission from the Senate to table in camera evidence-not in support of the report, because the evidence clearly has to be included with the report, but subsequent to the report. For what reason? She was seeking to argue against my minority report. In other words, she felt free and uninhibited in tabling what she herself called in camera evidence to prosecute her argument. Now we have this sanctimonious claptrap, this humbug, about in camera evidence and concern for witnesses. It is absolute rubbish.

It is not an unreasonable argument that if committee members cannot substantiate their report by fact and by evidence the findings are wanting. So they should gut the report because they will be able to point to no evidence to substantiate what they are saying. That is the fundamental problem.

         —The courtesy that is extended is to notify the Chairman of one's intention to prepare a minority report, not to give the substance of it. I will tell the Senate, for Senator Coates's information, the reason that minority reports and their substance are not required to be advised to the majority. We recently had a case in respect of the National Crime Authority (NCA) where there was some in camera evidence provided in the minority report. When that became apparent to the Government members there was contemplation about withdrawing the proposal to table a report at all. That would have been done to prevent there being a minority report and the reason for doing that would be to prevent the disclosure of in camera evidence. That is the reason, if we are talking about courtesy-that the minority reports are not vetted or approved by the Government or the majority of the Committee. I think Senator Cooney is right. There is a compelling argument for having the overwhelming majority of evidence given on the public record. It ought only be in special circumstances where evidence is heard in camera.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The problem is that there has been a growing temptation these days for committees to become more and more obsequious towards witnesses. Whenever a witness comes forward and requests to give his evidence in camera, there is a general temptation to agree to that. Once the evidence is in camera it is locked in. The problem, of course, is that there is only one way it can get out again and that is if the Committee says so. If we wanted to be half clever and we had both the numbers on the committee and were in government, and it was a contentious, controversial inquiry, we would take all the evidence in camera, and this would ensure there was no minority report.
       </para>
       <para>
        We all know the problems of treating evidence in camera. Senator Cooney made the point about star chambers. That is the whole point. Senator Cooney is a lawyer and knows better than most that the reason the courts are open to the public is not to demonstrate that justice is being done but that it is seen to be done so that the findings, the penalties, the conclusions, the decisions and the determinations of the judiciary are exposed to public scrutiny. Now, if we are going to have committees bringing down findings, recommendations and conclusions which are not substantiated by evidence, we throw into disrepute the workings of the Senate and the various committees.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find it remarkable that we have the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, which is concerned for the individual rights of people, suggesting that the evidence is locked up and it is only the findings that are released. In the same way, royal commissions are not held in camera by and large and almost every single royal commissioner will say from the outset that it is his intention to have as much evidence as possible on the public record-for exactly that reason.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently, the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, the Honourable Justice Phillips, agreed to my amendment of the National Crime Authority Act because he was concerned that the reputation of the NCA was falling into disrepute because of the veil of secrecy in which that authority was shrouded. There was no public accountability, no public scrutiny and no exposure of the workings of the Authority. Justice Phillips recognised that and he now proposes-mark this-to support the thrust of a proposal of the Australian Democrats, through Senator Spindler, that in camera evidence be released by the Committee or individual members of the Committee save where it can be demonstrated that it will interfere with an investigation or a prosecution, or where certain workings of the Authority in respect to law enforcement will be compromised. Even then, if the Authority disapproves, that question itself can be arbitrated by an independent arbitrator.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, if Justice Phillips were in this chamber now he would be arguing against this proposal because he is proposing quite the opposite. What Justice Phillips has been proposing has been supported by the Government and by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). Yet, we now have a quite contradictory proposition put to us here today. It is not without significance-and I do not want to dwell on the NCA-to note that it was Mr Lindsay, the Chairman, seconded by Senator Loosley, who released in camera evidence of a not insensitive nature. This evidence said:
       </para>

        GRASSBY was proceeded with against the advice of investigating police. Police believe there was not enough to proceed at that time.

        So that committee has found merit in putting previously in camera evidence on the public record.
       </para>
       <para>
        Can I just take up the point that Senator Watson apparently is running around the chamber trying to prosecute, and a view that has also been put by Senator Coates, which is that, once a witness gives in camera evidence, the genie cannot be let out of the bottle save if the witness says so. I put, with respect, how does one know what a witness is going to say before he says it? Yet, we are giving him carte blanche approval to give in camera evidence, which is never to be released without his approval, before he gives it. For crying out loud, where have we heard that proposition put before?

Because all the committee members' tongues are hanging out with excitement-pant, pant-they say, `Yes, we will take your evidence in camera'.

That is the proposition that is being put to us.

In those circumstances, after careful contemplation and reviewing the evidence that has been given to the Committee, the Committee may well come to the conclusion that it ought not be released.

        I have not forgotten when Senator Walsh came marching into this chamber and dropped a bunch of false cheque butts, seeking to smear people both in the chamber and outside. But because one of these cheque butts, which turned out to be false, was kept in his drawer and happened to be one I had, what did the Senate do to him? It censored him. He was the first Minister of Finance to my knowledge since Federation who has been censored by the chamber for personal conduct. While it may not have dented the hide of Senator Walsh, the average person would take note of that. That is the restriction that the Senate has got on the release of in camera evidence in an improper way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other proposition that is put to us is that the Senate has the right to release the evidence. On my reading, that is an absurdity. How does the Senate make a judgment to release in camera evidence which it has not heard? How does it hear it? How does it hear the in camera evidence because, as we all know, that is an offence and the meaning of offence is contempt of the Senate. Standing order 308 explicitly prohibits it and it is a criminal offence.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I interjected on Senator Coates, he said, `Will you get around and lobby your colleagues?'. What Senator Coates is suggesting is that one can be in contempt of the Senate but just do not get caught. One should sneak around the back and side doors and up the alleys, get to one's colleagues and say, `I have got this in camera evidence. I am not supposed to be releasing it because it is contrary to section 308 of the Standing Orders but have a bo-peep at this lot. When I move a motion for it to be made public just put your hand up, will you? You can't tell anybody that you have read it because I am not supposed to be showing it to you but I want you to support it.' That is the absurdity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coates might like to tell me sometime how the Senate is in a position to make a judgment as to whether or not in camera evidence given to a committee ought to be made public. There is no possible or practical way. I might just give an example of the problems of taking in camera evidence. One of the committees of which I am a member took evidence which required some sort of action. The committee wrote to the Australian Institute of Sport saying that there were certain matters that required some inquiry on its behalf in respect of, I think, previous athletes or present scholarship holders. But by a majority vote, the committee decided that it would not release the in camera evidence even to the authorities who were expected to act upon the evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, quite naturally, Mr Harris, I think it was, wrote back and said, `I note your decision not to disclose to us the in camera evidence which we have requested so we can act upon it and therefore we do not propose to act'. This was at a time when we were having a great deal of difficulty getting the authorities to deal in a proper and responsible way with the conduct of certain individuals.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to honourable senators that if that inquiry into drugs in sport had simply made a bland finding which said, `As a result of in camera evidence received by the committee we have drawn the conclusion that a number of athletes at the Australian Institute of Sport are using prohibited substances, banned substances, that they are on drugs; we do not propose to disclose who they are, how we found out, what the allegations were, what the assertions are; but take our word for it that there are crooks and cheats over at the Institute of Sport and that is all we will tell you because we are keeping it in camera', what a great finding that would be! That would really help the public debate. It would really help the reputations of the guys and girls who are not cheating. That would really help the reputation of the Institute, the officials and the coaches.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is absolutely inevitable that when a committee makes findings of that nature it at least should provide sufficient evidence to justify and support its findings. I notice that Senator Coates did not even want television cameras at the committee meetings. We now have television cameras in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. United States committees have had them for 25 years. Senator Coates did not want even that level of public scrutiny. I would have thought that the greatest safeguard for the rights of any individual is to ensure that what he says in respect of allegations is on the public record; that he is able to make his assertions and his defence to protect and preserve his reputation on the public record.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this Parliament ever gets to the stage where it makes findings about people and their reputations but is unable to substantiate those findings because it has chosen-inadvertently perhaps-to take evidence in camera, it is going to be a very sad day. Perhaps committees will have to show a bit more discipline when taking evidence. They had better start saying that from now on, `No, we will not take the evidence in camera'. The virtue of an individual having the right to change his mind is that after reviewing all the evidence, on balance he can make a determination whether the public good is helped, whether the findings of the committee are supported, and whether the proceedings and the functioning of the Parliament are more effective as a result of the release of that in camera evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no knowledge of any occasion on which the disclosure of any in camera evidence has caused any unfair or any unreasonable hardship to any individual or institution. We now have a situation where the Government would have itself as the censor of what ought to be released in the future. I find it a very poor way of seeking to proceed in this Parliament. As a matter of principle, we ought to seek as far as possible to have everything that we deal with on the public record and preserve only that in camera evidence which fits certain criteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        For my part, I would leave the status quo; I would leave in place the Standing Orders as they are presently interpreted. I notice that while the Democrats are supporting the amendment that Senator Hill is proposing, Senator Spindler, if I am not misrepresenting him, in fact proposes in his private member's Bill to go beyond that to some extent. Be that as it may, it is my view that the present situation ought to prevail. But, to the extent that commonsense and consensus can be found in terms of Senator Hill's amendment, I shall without apology or qualification be supporting that.

I did not say that and I would not say that. Secondly, he misrepresented my position on the televising of the drugs in sport inquiry. My position is that I support the televising of committee hearings in the system that is now available in committee rooms, with the use of discrete cameras in the walls. I opposed the televising of that drugs in sport inquiry because the procedure at the time would have involved four or five networks each with cameras intruding into and disrupting proceedings. I do not object to the system of televising hearings that is now available in some committee rooms.

         —I rise to speak in this debate and I open by saying that I have heard two speeches from the Opposition, from Senator Vanstone and Senator Crichton-Browne, which I think should be given out to any student of the irrelevant argument as neither senator directed comments to the question at issue.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Vanstone spent a lot of time talking about whether or not Parliament could be trusted with information. What a very interesting notion that is. What, indeed, was she saying that that has to do with in camera evidence to committees? What Senator Vanstone wanted to say was that, if we were not careful, we would be concluding here that Parliament could not be trusted and that we would need to give further protection to evidence. By some curious leap in the back of her head, she suggested that these proposals wanted to tighten the restraint orders on members of parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that in some ways this debate comes at a very apposite time following last night's adjournment debate and the deliberations about whether or not the documents that Senator McLean wanted to table should have been tabled and whether or not the public interest outweighed sub judice practice. On balance I think there was a fair consensus to concur with the President's ruling. As I understand it, nobody wanted to dissent from that, so I take it that it was agreed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was interesting that both the Opposition and Government senators who spoke wanted to support, on the record, the sub judice principle rather than the public interest. Indeed, I think that is essentially what we are talking about here today. I do not disagree with Senator Vanstone that Parliament is charged to a very significant degree to look at what is the public interest. It is the receiver of information and, indeed, sometimes may be the place of last resort for those in the community who feel that their rights have been threatened or overrun.
       </para>
       <para>
        I certainly would not in any way want to disagree with Senator Vanstone about the importance in this business of Parliament or parliamentary committees. But to leap from there to conclude that the proposed changes put forward by the Procedure Committee suggest de facto that Parliament cannot be trusted with information is just an illogical step. I do not follow Senator Vanstone's argument and she did not persuade me that there was a step of logic in it. Her argument slipped classically between one sentence and the next.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Vanstone then spent a lot of time talking about the need to protect the Executive, saying that senators of the government of the day would clearly want to close ranks and protect the Executive, particularly from the disclosure of information. As I understand it-I do not claim to be completely across all the Standing Orders, but I have sought information-the Estimates committees cannot hear evidence in camera. Their proceedings are entirely open and senators can ask whatever they wish.
       </para>
       <para>
        Estimates committees are a particularly good example of when the Executive is called before the Parliament and I know of no process or procedure by which Government senators could move to protect the Executive or to try to restrict the information provided by the Executive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am perfectly happy to say on the record that, by and large, the Executive needs no help at all in protecting itself. If there is something that it does not want to tell us, it is remarkably good at not telling us. If people think that is not necessarily the case, they should read the Sir Humphrey scripts and they would appreciate that there is a lot of documentation to that effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also say to Senator Vanstone that, while she can possibly conclude that Government senators would want to be more protective of the Executive, sometimes Government senators are more frustrated because of information they cannot find from the Executive, precisely because they have access to that information more readily as members of the Government than do members of the Opposition. That is a standard practice. I do not know what the situation is for my colleagues; I presume it is not very different from mine. I find that, having got information on behalf of a constituent, the difficulty then is in trying to develop that into getting the further information that sees a change to the benefit of the constituent.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are lively breaks and checks and balances, but I do not think that one could conclude, as readily as Senator Vanstone wanted to persuade us to do, that moving this way actually has to do with some kind of restriction on the Executive supported by Government senators. That is an interesting thing to be talking about in the Senate, but I do not really think it has particularly tight logical relevance to the debate in hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then we heard Senator Crichton-Browne and I congratulate him on another splendid performance. Again, I have to say that logic is not the highest criterion of Senator Crichton-Browne's contributions in this place. What we had from Senator Crichton-Browne was an argument by declaration based on his own experiences in committees. I do not object to honourable senators citing their own experience by way of illustration of a point, but to conclude that that is the only way of looking at in camera evidence, by restricting his considerations to the matters of the drugs in sport inquiry, does him little credit. Senator Crichton-Browne sells himself short.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have said before in this place that I am very much inclined to the view expressed by Senator Cooney and reiterated by Senator Crichton-Browne that, where possible, in camera evidence should not be taken; that it is really much better for the committee, for the witnesses, for public discussion and the public interest that all that evidence be on the public record.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also true that it is the amount of in camera evidence that creates the difficulties. So I presume that Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Cooney are not concluding that there should be no in camera evidence at any time. I take the point that what is being argued is that it should be minimal; there is a large sentiment to that. But in the end we still have to address the question of how we weigh up the amount of in camera evidence and so on. That is the question that we are deliberating about here.
       </para>
       <para>
        I actually had the experience of being on another committee where in camera evidence was given to us by the Australian Federal Police. It seemed to us entirely appropriate to have that evidence in camera. It seemed to us entirely proper not to refer to that evidence directly, except to use it as background information, which then was useful in questioning other witnesses. In no way did we allude to it. But it seems to me that is one of the proper ways in which in camera evidence can assist a committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the end, what we are talking about is whether or not we parliamentarians or members of committees are old enough to cope with the burden of responsibility that comes as a consequence of being party to special information. I think that is the challenge we have to grapple with. On the whole, I would presume my colleagues are able to deal with that. But I also think a lot of us-certainly I am one-have had great anxiety about the rapid increase in the release of in camera evidence to the point of being concerned about what kind of weight is still being given to in camera evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regard in camera evidence as something of a very serious nature. Committees do not take in camera evidence lightly. Presumably, it is either sought or provided because of the serious nature of the content of that evidence. It can go to the individual rights of people or, as in the case of the committee I referred to earlier, it can go to matters before law and the rights of large organisations. It can be a whole variety of sorts. But I think it is not beyond honourable senators to cope with the responsibility that comes with being party to that information and then, according to these proposals, make reasonable decisions about whether or not it should be released.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Crichton-Browne argued that, if in camera evidence could not be released, a dissenting report could not be written. Senator Crichton-Browne knows, as well as I do, that that is not true. A very comprehensive and adequate dissenting report could be written. It may be that the Senate committee from which he sought permission to release in camera evidence may deny him that permission, but that would not deny him the capacity to write a significant dissenting report. If he puts that up as a serious lollipop, allow me to belt it out of court. It is just a good spurious argument that I do not think is persuasive at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a presumption, in the words of Senator Crichton-Browne, that government senators of the day would want to block the release of in camera evidence-a presumption that we are all of one mind and are always likely to protect whatever is the presumed interest of the majority of the committee. I can give plenty of examples of government senators who have written dissenting reports-indeed I stand here as one of them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Crichton-Browne, going, as he does, more to the ad hominem series of arguments, has missed the opportunity to make a contribution on the logic of these issues. What the Senate is considering is the best way of dealing with in camera evidence consequent on an extravagant release of in camera evidence to the point where people began to doubt whether there is any point in using the words `in camera evidence' or providing for it at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the intention of the Senate is to do away with in camera evidence altogether, let us so conclude. But nobody wants to say that. Nobody is saying that there should be no in camera evidence. Nobody wants to say that we will never again allow an opportunity for that. So what we are going to have to decide then is what we do with in camera evidence. If we accept the proposals put by Senator Cooney and Senator Crichton-Browne that we restrict as much as possible what is taken as in camera evidence, it behoves us even more than before to be clear about the status of that in camera evidence; where, when and how it can be released; and whose rights and liberties we might want to guarantee by way of protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a matter of great significance that we are asked to look at in camera evidence. I think the proposals put out by the Procedure Committee go a long way to addressing very thoughtfully the best way of dealing with the disclosure of in camera evidence and, in particular, the idea of the full committee which has taken that in camera evidence being asked to consider whether the release of it is proper. All the senators on the committee heard the evidence. They would be in the best position to understand the weight of that evidence as part of the report that might want to be given and the conclusions that may be drawn from it. That is not an unreasonable or unthoughtful consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to the final point I would like to make about Senator Crichton-Browne's contribution. He came in here and argued that a committee had taken in camera evidence of claims of less than elegant behaviour in the Institute of Sport; that the Director rang up and said, `Give us that evidence so we can act'; that we said, `Well, no, we don't want to give you that in camera evidence'; and that he said, `Well, then, I cannot act'. That is some measure, I would suggest, of the limitations of the Director's understanding of the issue. If we could find out about this, presumably it is open to other people in the appropriate authority to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there is now clear evidence that there were unacceptable behaviours going on at the Institute of Sport, I think it is beholden to accept that general statement and then proceed to its own inquiry, properly respecting the rights and liberties of the people at the Institute of Sport-the athletes, or whoever. It is an outrageous conclusion to reach that the Institute could proceed to act only if we released our evidence-a very false understanding I should have thought, Senator Crichton-Browne, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. For many reasons, but in particular by way of opposing some of the, I think, insufficient arguments advanced by Opposition senators in this place, I am happy to make my comments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, I strongly endorse restricting in camera evidence to as little as is absolutely necessary. I take the case that the public record and the rights of people and the committee are best protected by all the evidence, or as much of it as possible, being on the public record. However, when it is judged or sought that we take evidence in camera, I believe we have to address the most useful, proper, constructive way of dealing with that in camera evidence so as to enable the Senate, the Parliament, to have adequate information to make appropriate conclusions and, at the same time, protect the rights of the people giving us the evidence. I believe that the Procedure Committee, in coming up with these three recommendations, goes a long way to making sure that the optimal outcome regarding in camera evidence is achieved. The Opposition's arguments, to this point, are not persuading me to think differently.

        I apologise to the chamber for the fact that the wording of the amendment circulated was in the past tense. In order to conform more closely with my intention of having a greater uniformity of in camera evidence, and to conform more closely with the words of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in terms of its Act of Parliament which governs in camera evidence, I put my motion as submitted in the present tense.
       </para>
       <para>
        I point out that before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts takes in camera evidence, it follows a procedure that it has followed very closely since 1951, when that Act applied.

I believe we must seek to have a greater uniformity across the Parliament in the giving of in camera evidence. The purpose of my amendment is to seek greater uniformity and greater certainty of witnesses, because it is unfortunate if we have some rules for presenting in camera evidence to certain committees and lesser rules for others regarding tightness of obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, I remind the Senate that, after many years of practice, we in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are very reluctant to accept in camera evidence. It is not taken lightly; it is taken only after prior consultation and discussion highlighting the range of issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this amendment will prevent irresponsibility and will ensure-it has certainly been the case with the Public Accounts Committee-that vital information, whether confidential or secret, will come forth to a committee. Without this amendment I believe the usefulness of a lot of inquiries could well be severely impeded.

         —I will be brief because my colleagues have already expressed the reservations that I feel about moving from the status quo with regard to our Standing Orders and the conduct of Senate inquiries and other activities of the Senate. I strongly believe that the present Standing Orders are adequate and that honourable senators are sufficiently mature to be able to discuss matters of in camera evidence, firstly by restricting in camera evidence to a minimum and then by using that in camera evidence maturely and appropriately. I would resist strongly any changes to the Standing Orders that would restrict the freedom of honourable senators to speak the truth and to be able to put a view which is in the interests of this chamber and in the interests of the Australian public.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In brief, I oppose the three proposals marked (1), (2) and (3) in the report of the Procedure Committee because they shift too greatly our procedure away from the current Standing Orders and they restrict honourable senators' freedoms in a grave way. I am prepared to support the form of words set out on page 4 of the report which reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        A dissenting Senator who wishes to refer to in camera evidence should advise the committee of the evidence concerned, and all reasonable effort should be made by the committee to reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for that purpose. If agreement is not reached, the dissenting Senator may refer to the in camera evidence in the dissent only to the extent necessary to support the reasoning of the dissent. Witnesses who gave the evidence in question should, if it is practicable, be informed in advance of the proposed disclosure of the evidence and should be given reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure and to ask that particular parts of the evidence not be disclosed. The committee should give careful consideration to any objection by a witness before making its decision. Consideration should be given to disclosing the evidence in such a way as to conceal the identity of persons who gave the evidence or who are referred to in the evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important point to be made about that paragraph is that it reinforces certain cautions which I believe are the practice of experienced senators in any event. But those words do not take away any of the current powers of honourable senators nor do they in fact concretely deny any of the Standing Orders that we have in the Senate at the moment. Rather, the advantage of these words is that they could completely resolve the matter that is before us in a way which I believe could gain the majority support of the Senate. Guidelines are set out clearly-guidelines which have been convention in the experience of many senators in recent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I refer to in camera evidence which may need to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Privilege. In recent years the Senate has referred many matters to the Privileges Committee where a person giving evidence to a committee may be alleged to have misled a Senate committee or where a person who has given evidence to a Senate committee is being persecuted or punished in some way in the community on account of giving such evidence. To maintain the freedoms of ordinary citizens in this country, we must ensure that people are free and protected in giving evidence to Senate inquiries. Also, we want to have ways of ensuring that the evidence that is given is truthful and not misleading.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the conduct of inquiries on references that come to the Privileges Committee there have been instances where the material in question was given in camera to a Senate inquiry. It is impossible, in my mind, for the Privileges Committee to do its work if it does not have access to that in camera material. Whilst I am happy to say in this debate that the Privileges Committee has never resolved to deny itself access to in camera evidence in another inquiry, and whilst I am also happy to say that no standing committee has ever denied in camera material to the Privileges Committee on our request, this could be contemplated. This matter could be even subject to a resolution of the Privileges Committee in a particular case-a self-denying resolution that might lead the Privileges Committee to bind itself not to have access to certain in camera material.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let such cases be considered on their merits. I want to make it very clear that, as a member of the Privileges Committee, I would be under the obligation, where there was any resolution to deny ourselves access to such in camera material, to report that to the Senate, especially if it were felt by any member of the Privileges Committee that we could not fulfil a reference that had been given to us to investigate and bring a report to the Senate. It seems useful at this time to note that particular aspect of in camera evidence as it relates to the Privileges Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, I urge the Senate to reject proposals (1), (2), and (3) in the report of the Procedure Committee. If the status quo is not to continue, there is, I believe, an ability for us all to conscientiously support the paragraph which I read out and which is set out on page 4 of the report.

The Standing Committee on Procedure was divided on its recommendation; in fact, it divided five votes to four. The motion before the Senate at the moment is that of the majority and it is to set out a slightly more strict regime in dealing with in camera evidence than the position advocated by the minority. That position, nevertheless, is to introduce further restrictions than is currently the case, or is perceived to be the case.

I refer the Minister to today's disastrous December quarterly consumer price index rise of 2.7 per cent, half as high again as the previous December quarter, which shows that despite the fact that the economy has been in recession for over 12 months, the CPI is now running at an annual rate of 6.9 per cent. I ask: how does the Minister reconcile these facts with the statement by the Prime Minister on the Sunday program three days ago that progress on inflation `has been part of the product of this period of pain', and in which he also said, `I believe it is going to fall further'?

Let me talk about the particular circumstances of the CPI figure which was announced for the December quarter today. Of course, that figure was poorer than expected. It was 2.7 per cent for the quarter, as Senator Short points out, equating to 6.9 per cent for the year to date. In spite of that, I think market comment about the figure has not been one of great dismay, it is higher than market expectations. The CPI figures for the quarter have been very substantially affected by the rise in oil prices, largely bunched in that quarter.

         —I am told to concentrate on Australia. For years members of the Opposition concentrated on the United Kingdom. They used to say, `Why are we doing so badly compared with Margaret Thatcher's Government in Britain?' But they have dropped off all that now. It does not help. Those opposite should listen to the figures: the figure is 7.4 per cent for the OECD countries as a whole; for the United Kingdom, the figure is 9.9 per cent, a figure which we have not seen in Australia since the Opposition was in government; and for the United States, the figure is 6.2 per cent. Let me put it in that perspective, because there are a number of comparative factors which are important. The CPI figure has been affected not only by the direct oil price which everybody expected, but also by the oil price flowing through to higher household energy costs and rising air fares.

        In addition, the CPI reflects increases in State taxes and charges on beer, cigarettes and tobacco.

         —I did; I said I was wrong in the words I used to the Committee prior to the luncheon adjournment. I was wrong in the words I used. However, firstly, let me say that in the data collection for deeming, when forms were sent out some weeks ago to those with financial arrangements which so far as we knew meant they would be affected, they were not sent to pensioners who had a warranty coded or who were on a group payment. That excluded most of the frail aged pensioners and those who are most infirm, particularly those who are in nursing homes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, it is the special administrative measures which have been taken to protect the over-80s which I wish to outline. Firstly, they will be protected from the deeming rules for cash and accounts until the Department of Social Security has contacted each pensioner individually, firstly, to explain the new rules and, secondly, to assist the pensioner to reorganise his or her affairs to earn extra interest. Until that follow-up action is taken, pensioners will not have their pensions suspended because of non-return of the data collection form and will not have their pensions reduced under the deeming rules on cash and accounts. Therefore, the administrative arrangements have it that over-80s will be protected and will not have their pensions reduced after 1 March, even if some of them have not complied with the deeming rules. That is what I did not say to the Committee and what I wanted to make clear to the Senate now. Special arrangements do apply for the over-80s and that will mean that no persons in that category who do not comply immediately will have their pension reduced unless and until they have been contacted individually by the Department and their affairs have been cleared up and assisted by the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should also say that under the Act I have the power to exempt any person or class of persons from the provisions of deeming. Of course, I will do that should it become necessary and should it become obvious that anyone is being particularly disadvantaged as a result of it.

The ground on which Israel and many other countries in the Middle East are barred is provision 9d of the guidelines concerning the export of military hardware, foreign policy interests being the major factor. The Government has had a policy for those reasons not to send lethal military goods and in some cases what we would term non-lethal military goods into that region, because it is a region with a major arms build-up. I suppose that it is regrettable, but the only exception to that appears to me to be the sale to that region of a small number of trainer aircraft parts by Hawker de Havilland, something that the Government cancelled subsequently as a result of the United Nations arms embargo.

        Israel has not been particularly picked out as a country, and there is no reason why it should in the Middle East context; it is simply the region that we are talking about. As I said at the press conference, that does not preclude Israel or any other country from applying through the normal processes and then at least appealing to me as a final arbiter in these matters-and I do have responsibility for the final decision making process. I guess that, for instance, if we had been the major producer of Patriot missiles in the last few weeks and they had gone through the processes, I would have had to have a very serious think about that because that would have added very much to the self-defence of a country that is facing totally unprovoked aggression from another country. But Israel itself has not been specifically chosen in this instance; it is the general Middle East countries. As I say, I can point to one exception to that, and the Minister at the time and I-I think it involved both Ministers-did not regard it as a significant military product.

         —There were some useful consultations held a couple of weeks ago involving the so-called 3As-that is, Foreign Minister Alatas of Indonesia, Madame Edwige Avice, France's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs representing the two co-chairmen of the Paris Conference, accompanied by Mr Rafeeuddin Ahmed, who is the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General. They visited Hanoi from 31 January to 2 February for consultations with Vietnamese leaders on the Cambodian settlement question. The particular purpose of those consultations was to explain to Vietnam the provisions of the draft settlement text that were agreed by the Permanent Five members of the Security Council on 26 November and that were put by the Paris Conference co-chairmen to the members of the Cambodian Factions Supreme National Council, which met again in Paris on 21 and 22 December. Vietnam had not been an immediate party to those consultations but because it obviously continues to be a very influential player in the Cambodian settlement process, it was thought desirable that it be the subject to the specific consultative process; thus this meeting.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The outcome of the consultations, despite some mixed press reports which honourable senators no doubt would have seen was, in my judgment, on the briefing I have had, broadly positive and certainly has helped maintain momentum in the settlement process. I have to say that that process has not been leaping forward in recent months but it has been inching forward. The United Nations peace plan, based of course on the original proposal from Australia, remains in our judgment the only viable way of finally and peacefully resolving this conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Vietnamese, in these consultations, reaffirmed their acceptance of the Permanent Five framework, on which the draft settlement text is based. They expressed support for the efforts of the co-chairmen to resolve remaining issues. They also agreed, importantly, to discuss these issues further with the SOC-State of Cambodia regime in Phnom Penh.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that the consultations in Vietnam and elsewhere have confirmed over recent weeks that there are really now three significant unresolved issues, namely: the demobilisation provisions in the draft settlement text; associated weapons custody arrangements; and how to deal in the settlement text with the issue of non-return of genocide, and how that should be linguistically addressed. Given the necessary political will to resolve these issues, which is still evident, a comprehensive settlement is still well in sight.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the latter part of the question about possible elections to be held in Cambodia by the Phnom Penh Government, it is premature to say what role Australia and the UN might play if there is no settlement and those elections are proceeded with on a unilateral basis some time in 1992, as has been suggested. Certainly it is our judgment that the unilateral holding of elections will not resolve the conflict or end crucial outside assistance to the Khmer Rouge. The only thing that can do that is a comprehensive settlement, and it can do it by ensuring that China cooperates in the processes and ceases its military support to the Khmer Rouge. In our judgment, only a comprehensive settlement of the kind proposed under the UN plan will enable all Cambodians to determine their future through free and fair elections-elections, of course, conducted and organised by the UN.
       </para>
       <para>
        All of these considerations underline the urgency of focusing every effort now on achieving a comprehensive settlement and not being distracted by other international events. Australia continues to welcome the very assiduous efforts that are being made by the Paris Conference cochairmen to resolve differences. We continue to hope that a date for the reconvening of the coordinating committee of the Paris Conference can be set as soon as possible so that the finalisation of the settlement text can be carried out.

         —I thank Senator Bourne for that question. It is also one which Senator Michael Baume has taken a particular interest in. Dr Khmara, a deputy of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, was arrested during a demonstration in Kiev on 7 November last to protest against the commemoration of the Bolshevik revolution. While there are conflicting reports on the incident which led to his arrest, I understand that the resolution which stripped him of his parliamentary immunity was passed-as Senator Bourne has said-without a quorum being present in the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. That is obviously a matter of very great concern.

       <para>
        Following representations made to us on this matter from the Ukrainian community in December, I did instruct the Australian Embassy in Moscow to seek clarification from the Soviet authorities of the details of Mr Khmara's case and to convey to them the Australian Government's concerns to ensure that Mr Khmara's human rights are not violated. Those concerns were also raised by Australian Government representatives at bilateral consultations covering human rights issues that were held in Moscow in January. The Embassy will, I can assure honourable senators, continue to pursue his case with the Soviet authorities.
       </para>

        Might I say just this in conclusion: while the Australian Government does appreciate the complexity of the problems facing the Soviet Union, we do strongly urge that efforts to solve them should not be at the expense of the progress achieved in recent years in creating a very much more open society in the Soviet Union with a greater respect for human rights.

It is a fact that many households, rather than being havens of safety, are places where domestic violence is experienced, particularly and obviously by women in our society. Among other things, the Committee recommended that to deal with this blight on our society there should be the introduction of restraint orders across jurisdictions, and that the problem of ensuring that restraint orders can be effective across jurisdictions should be treated as a priority by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.

        I am pleased to say that the Attorneys met early last week, on 7 February, and agreed that the protection offered by restraint orders should be available to the victims of violence who move to new States or Territories, regardless of inconsistencies in legislation in the various jurisdictions. I believe that this move will be of great benefit to and be welcomed by those who seek the protection of the courts to ensure that so far as possible they are not put in a position where their vulnerability makes them, in a perilous situation, victims of terrible violence. It was also agreed that the Commonwealth would investigate amending the Service and Execution of Process Act to implement these proposals.

        The National Committee on Violence report has been very well received in the community.

In so far as the Attorneys-General have reacted so promptly to that recommendation, they are to be commended.

         —The recent draft ruling from the Taxation Office was very welcome because there has been a lot of concern and discussion over this issue for some time. In general terms, the ruling clarifies the situation with respect to syndicated research and development, and sets out the relationship between the various sectors of the legislation. We believe that it will be an effective ruling in preventing syndicate proposals that employ limited debt which seek to circumvent the provisions of the legislation and, thereby, obtain the full concession for expenditure that is, essentially, not at risk.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Preliminary indications are that the ruling will not have a significant impact on the willingness of investors to participate in syndication. However, it is considered that they will be more selective in terms of the type of R and D projects in which they will invest. I suspect that in the future they will not be the longer term, high risk projects, but more towards projects which have a closer possibility of commercialisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, I consider that the ruling will go a long way towards eliminating proposals that seek to gain unintended benefits for investors through the use of limited or non recourse debt. Further, the likely shift in emphasis away from longer term R and D towards shorter term, close to market project development will, I believe, provide a significant boost to Australian industry and, therefore, increase the interests of industry in taking advantage of the syndication proposal. With the provision of syndicated R and D, and in the light of the Tax Office ruling, this stage of the R and D-that is, closer to commercialisation R and D-can be accelerated by the injection of new funds, with the result that companies are able to bring new projects on to world markets much more quickly.

        Given the Reserve Bank of Australia's involvement, and the statement by the Treasurer on the John Laws program on Monday, `If there is a problem, I will hear', how can he claim no knowledge prior to the end of January when the State Bank of South Australia was submitting monthly reports all through 1990?

         —Following Senator Olsen's question yesterday, I did undertake to get some further information for him. I was proposing to give him an answer at the end of Question Time. Senator Olsen suggested yesterday that the Reserve Bank had had an officer working in the State Bank. From the way in which Senator Olsen put his question, this was based on Mr Marcus Clark's statement, as I recall it. I am informed that the Reserve Bank has not had an officer posted to the State Bank of South Australia in recent years. The State Bank of South Australia, I am instructed, has undertaken voluntarily to comply with the prudential requirements of the Reserve Bank and provides the Reserve Bank with regular returns. However, this information does not extend to details of individual loans.

        The State Government support package announced on the weekend has the objective, amongst other things, of keeping the capital position of the State Bank of South Australia in line with the prudential requirements of the Reserve Bank. In a sense that was one of the main purposes of that injection in so far as the banking system as a whole was concerned.

        Since September 1988 the Reserve Bank capital adequacy guidelines have extended to the consolidated-I stress that word-activities of banks and their subsidiaries. Since late 1989 guidelines on large exposures have also been applied on a group consolidated basis. Since the second half of 1990, information has been collected on the aggregate of non-performing loans-that is, aggregate, non-performing loans; the total portfolio of non-performing loans. I am advised that the Reserve Bank informed the Treasurer of emerging problems in the State Bank of South Australia when the magnitude of these non-performing loans was becoming apparent at the end of January.

I will not speak on behalf of the Prime Minister. He has expressed his views and he will answer any such questions in the other place at the appropriate time. I must take grave exception to Senator Vallentine's accusation that I have made claims of bias against the ABC.
        </para>

       <para>
        I did have a dispute-and it was here in the chamber, all honourable senators heard it-with Radio Australia. It was not over a question of bias, but over whether it would provide a service that it had provided in the previous December to Australian servicemen in the Gulf. The honourable senator has often come into this chamber and thrown around accusations and conspiracy theories. I ask her to produce an instance where I am on the public record of accusing the ABC of bias. I ask her to go through my press conferences, my statements in the Parliament and elsewhere, and highlight where I have made that accusation. I know it does not exist because I have not made it. Whatever my views may be, the ABC is not my ministerial responsibility and I would never make those public views going into someone else's portfolio.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that Senator Vallentine's views are inaccurate, I can understand them because many other reporters-including those in the ABC-have said that I have attacked the ABC without once ever backing up such a statement with a substantive quote, apart from the Radio Australia episode, which was not a question of bias. I have had one dispute with the ABC over recent weeks which was basically a private one. I can make that public now. The ABC carried a report-Senator Vallentine refers to accuracy-that two Australian ships had collided in the Gulf and it ran that report uncorroborated for some hours.
       </para>
       <para>
        As it turned out, an accusation was made that the source of this information was a Saudi Arabian taxi driver in Sydney. However, on investigation the ABC rigorously denied that. It grossly embarrassed David Hill by assuring him that that was not the source. However, on a better view, on further investigation, subsequently that was found to be the source. Nevertheless, I think the ABC manager of news, to be fair to him, gave a fairly good response. He said, `Look, we have flown 40,000 news sorties and we have had one shot down. The ABC is going to try to make sure that that sort of uncorroborated news story does not go to air again'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I accept-and I am sure that Mr Beazley accepted-the two page apology that he received on that particular issue. That dispute was on accuracy, not on the question of bias. Senator Vallentine can ask Senator Button, the Minister representing the Prime Minister, for his views on it but she should not come into this chamber with a view that I have attacked the ABC on the question of bias.
       </para>
       <para>
        Never one to let an opportunity go by to give a gratuitous insult now and then, the one issue that has concerned me is the amount of time the ABC has spent on analysing itself. That is my general view, and Senator Collins can rebuke me later for going into his area. I do not believe the ABC should be the news itself. I do not believe that every talkback program on the ABC-every time Senator Hill is interviewed I hear him asked these questions-should be on the question of the ABC and bias. People are entitled to spend some time on that, but not an inordinate amount of time. ``I have answered questions at press conferences on whether I believe the ABC is biased et cetera. Not one of the answers I gave was ever reported either on the ABC or in any newspapers, but I have been asked before and I have had to say that in the totality of the coverage it has been very hard to measure where there is balance, especially in the first couple of weeks. The ABC has been covering so many stories, so many times that it would be very difficult for some arbiter to say whether there is a balance. Later on it can look back on those programs, make an assessment and do any particular corrections that may be necessary. That process may well be under way today but, again, I reject the fact that Senator Vallentine asks me, a Minister not responsible for the ABC, questions about this. I again reject the direct statement that I have attacked the ABC for bias. It is just another typical question that Senator Vallentine brings into this chamber-poorly researched, based on conspiracy theories and knocking over straw men.

         —Mr President, I will deal with the question in the two parts it was delivered in. In respect of peak period pricing, it is beyond question that Sydney Airport is the most important engine that drives the international tourist industry in this country and, to a great degree, the domestic tourist industry in this country. The importance of Sydney airport as a major agenda item in the micro-economic reform agenda of the Government cannot be overstated; it is an extremely important matter.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is also no question that there is a serious congestion problem at Sydney Airport. Peak period pricing was introduced on 1 January by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), not in isolation but as part of a whole range of measures that have been and are being progressively introduced at Sydney Airport to alleviate the congestion-and with some significant success. Simultaneous operations were introduced at the airport last year, and peak period pricing, as I said, on 1 January this year. Two rapid exit taxiways are going to be constructed this year at Sydney Airport. Very importantly, the Committee on schedule coordination is now achieving for the first time some real success in avoiding one of the major problems in congestion at the airport which is the cluster scheduling that is engaged in by the airlines. There is a great deal of cooperation now to having that relieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The FAC reluctantly introduced peak period pricing and, I might add, after extensive consultations with the industry and indeed myself. It has very closely restricted the actual peaks, for which there is a charge, to just one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening, with shoulders, as Senator Brownhill said. But also, as a result of sensitivities attached to this issue, the FAC is going to review that peak period pricing regime in March, that is, after barely three months of operation. I have personally made it clear and the FAC has made it clear to the affected airlines and, indeed, the travellers who use those airlines, that it will be reviewed after a relatively short period of operation to measure whether the problem raised by Senator Brownhill is a real problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        My advice at this stage of the game is that new peaks being created on the shoulders are currently not perceived as a problem. I am not doubting for a minute that the delay Senator Brownhill referred to happened and, indeed, in individual cases these delays are still occurring. But I can assure Senator Brownhill that the statistics available to me show there has been a significant improvement in the delay problem at Sydney Airport.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to the last part of the question, which is a very important one, I understand the matter was raised in the House of Representatives yesterday with my colleague, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. She quite firmly stated yesterday her view that no public inquiry could be justified, and that is also my view. I spent most of one afternoon last week in Sydney being briefed on the 1,900 submissions that have been received by Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd on the EIS. They canvass every conceivable issue that could possibly be canvassed, I might add, at the end of an extremely extensive public process. Mobile vans went around to the affected communities and it was widely advertised that they would be there. There was a wide open process to allow the maximum public input into the process.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe very firmly that no good public purpose would be served by any public inquiry. Considering the public inquiries that have been held under that process in the past and the time taken for them, it would effectively remove, in my view, the construction of the third runway at Sydney airport from the Government's agenda for this term of office. That, of course, is precisely what the people proposing it want to have the inquiry for but, as far as I am concerned, there is no justification for it and it would not add anything to the information that has already been received as part of the EIS process.

For example in Mackay, where there have been record rains exceeding the yearly average by 30 per cent and not equalled since earlier this century, extensive road damage and coastal erosion caused by these rains are not recognised for disaster relief, because they are not considered to be littoral flooding.

The measures which are administered at the present time by the Department of Finance relating to national disaster relief are also jointly administered by State governments. Senator Reynolds's specific question goes to whether rain damage would be included under these arrangements. I have been advised that various sorts of rain damage may be eligible for national disaster relief arrangements assistance, depending on the circumstances, and that the Queensland Government has issued detailed guidelines covering these circumstances-for example, providing for concessional loans to farmers with rain-damaged crops, specifying the sort of road damage to which local councils can seek assistance for repair, and matters of that kind.

However, in the light of Senator Reynolds's question, I will see to it that the Minister for Finance asks his Department to consult with Queensland, specifically on the issues of rain damage to roads, and to determine whether there is a need for any change to guidelines for the existing practices.

I further note that in 1989-90, the Minister approved the sale of Strikemaster trainer aircraft to Somalia, whose government at that time had a well-documented record of using military force to kill its unarmed civilians and had established a counter-insurgency squadron in its air force. While the application was subsequently withdrawn, this was not the Minister's decision but that of the company concerned. I ask the Minister: firstly, does he accept that, had the trainer aircraft been delivered, pilots trained in them could have used the trainer in counter-insurgency attacks such as bombing and strafing villages? Secondly, does he accept that Iraq's PC9 trainer aircraft, for which the Minister had approved the sale of engine parts before Iraq invaded Kuwait, could have been used to train Iraqi pilots to attack Kurdish villagers with chemical weapons? Thirdly, does he further acknowledge the view put by David Lague in the Australian Financial Review of 6 February that the PC9s could have been used directly in an attack role? Fourthly, does he therefore agree that the moral distinction drawn in the defence export guidelines between combat and military trainer aircraft is artificial and expedient?

The word `precluded' was not used, so I suggest that Senator McLean should go back to his source material and should not re-interpret it. That does not take away the general thrust of his question, but I am disappointed that he has started on such poor bases. In terms of an answer to the first question, that was a judgment that my predecessor had to make. He quite clearly made a judgment that would not be in line with the suggestion which Senator McLean makes.

        In regard to the second question: no, I do not think Iraq's PC trainer aircraft would have been used in any direct military sense in Iraq.

        The third question asked was: do I agree with the views put by David Lague? No, I do not. I have never found his articles overendowed with research or embroidered with much strategic thinking. The clearest example of that is this morning in his analysis of the amount of expenditure in the Gulf. He certainly seems to me to apply and belong to the cynical school of journalists. No, I do not put any weight to his thinking on that.

        On the final point, I have never mentioned the words `moral distinction'. Senator McLean is entitled to if he thinks that is what it is based on and that there is a moral distinction between-using the shorthand term-lethal and non-lethal goods. I think that distinction is quite a clear one in terms of our export policy. I do not say that it is based strictly on morality.

         —I thank Senator Zakharov for her question. She has indicated that she has had many inquiries in her own electoral office. I am, of course, aware of widespread concern in the community amongst farmers and consumers about the adequacy of country of origin labelling on food products.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I strongly believe that Australians making purchases in the marketplace have a right to be informed of the country of origin of the foodstuffs that they purchase. They can then make a subsequent judgment as to whether they wish to support Australian farmers and those involved in our orcharding and fishing industry when they make their purchase.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be noted that the food standards code requires that all packaged food sold in Australia be labelled with a statement of where the food was made or produced. As Senator Boswell will recall, it became apparent last year that there were a number of problems with the labelling of fruit juices. It came to my attention that some suppliers of packaged fruit juices have been labelling their goods as `Australian' when in fact some or all of the juice content has been imported. It is my strong view that this is misleading to consumers and detrimental to our local citrus industry, and I therefore requested the Australian Food Standards Committee (AFSC) to address the situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The AFSC recommended that where any packaged fruit juice contains an imported fruit component, it must be labelled as such. I believe that health Ministers around Australia are looking to implement that recommendation. I was also concerned that presently unpackaged foods are not required to be labelled with their country of origin, and I directed the Australian Food Standards Committee to look at this issue also.
       </para>
       <para>
        It recommended that unpackaged imported fish, fruit, vegetables and nuts should be labelled at retail level with a statement of their country of origin or an indication that they had been imported. I believe both these recommendations are being considered by health Ministers in the States and Territories and should come into effect later this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government takes seriously any suggestion that consumers are being mislead by country of origin labelling. The Trade Practices Act makes it an offence for a firm to make a misleading representation concerning place of origin of goods. I have been so concerned about it that I have referred the issue to the Trade Practices Commission to determine whether there has been a breach of the Act, particularly in regard to mislabelling of fruit juices.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend Senator Zakharov for her interest in this most important issue. I assure her and all honourable senators that the Government has been active in ensuring that consumers are provided with accurate information about the country of origin of food so that they can exercise their purchasing power in support of Australian producers.

Far from defending the pace of waterfront reform, I criticised it.

        So far as Mr Setchell is concerned, Mr Setchell of course is acting for his company. He does not actually represent National Terminals, which has negotiated an agreement; he is its major competitor. He works for Conaust and it has not negotiated an agreement. I just said that in the answer I gave to Senator Lewis. The fact is that there has been a substantial agreement negotiated in Sydney and Melbourne with National Terminals. As I said before, the Conaust matter has been taken to the Industrial Relations Commission by Conaust, which is a right it has under the in-principle agreement which was signed and which provides for this process. That is where the matter will no doubt be pursued.

        The Opposition has deliberately brought this matter before the Senate today as a matter of urgency rather than as a matter of public importance. It is a matter of great public significance and importance, but the reason we are debating it as a matter of urgency is that the Senate will have to vote on this matter at the end of the debate. I very much hope and expect that the Australian Democrats will support the matter of urgency. If ever in Australia's history we have had a need for a government to correct its mismanagement and the miscalculations it has made for a period of many years, as a result of which each and every Australian, in whatever walk of life he or she may be in, is suffering great hardship, it is the situation that we have today.

         —We have had similar debates on this and related matters in recent months and each and every time the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has refused to participate. As he just said to me, one of the reasons is that he agrees with the first part of this urgency motion.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The debate is of great importance. If we were to have a text for today's debate it would be a quote from the Treasurer, who in 1989 said:
       </para>
       <para>
        a recession achieves nothing in structural terms other than induced social misery and corporate weakness.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is precisely what the policies-not only miscalculated but also deliberately contrived policies-of this Government have produced over recent years under the stewardship of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen these miscalculations and disastrous policies in not just the Federal Labor Government but also every State government in the nation which has been Labor controlled. Indeed, we now have the incredible situation of three State Labor governments being forced to have royal commissions into their financial activities and financial dealings because of their ineptitude, incompetence and, in some cases, corruption in management of the States' finances. The great loser in this is the average Australian taxpayer, the average person, who looks to his or her government for competence, proper management, propriety and integrity. At the Federal and State levels we have seen a denial of those basic qualities that electors expect-and rightly so-from their governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent days the Federal Treasurer has said about the South Australian case and earlier about the Victorian case that there would be no bail-out of these Labor governments by the federal taxpayer. That is simply not true. There was a major bail-out in the case of Victoria. In the last 48 hours the Treasurer has given permission for the South Australian Government to breach the agreed Loan Council borrowing guidelines to the tune of almost $1 billion, which has an automatic impact on the public sector borrowing requirement of the nation as a whole. It is a direct call on the savings of this nation-savings which have been almost obliterated by this Government's policies. This is a further call on the national savings at a time when the Government's approach should be directed to increasing our pool of national savings and increasing the ability of the private sector to avail itself of those savings. In recent times the Government's operations have been directly opposed to that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, so dramatic has been the blow-out in the Government's fiscal policy and so much has it lost control of fiscal policy that, far from having a public sector borrowing requirement of nil for Australia this year, as was predicted in the Budget, it now appears almost certain that the blow-out of both Federal and State Budgets will mean a public sector borrowing requirement of about 2 per cent for this financial year. This is a dramatic turnaround over a period of only two to three years. Three years ago, the public sector borrowing requirement, very rightly, was in a deficit situation; in other words, national savings were not being called on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The turnaround in the fiscal position of the Government has been enormous. Now, partly as a result of that, we have a full-blown recession-a recession which both the Treasurer and Prime Minister said two days before the last election that we would not have. Then the Treasurer said that we were to have a slowdown-that a slowdown was what was required. Then he then said, `Well, we got it wrong and in fact it is a recession. We have pulled the levers. The levers have produced a slowdown but we also used them to produce a recession and this was a recession that we had to have'. He is now trying to weasel his way out of that because the Prime Minister has tackled him on it. Because of the ongoing dispute for leadership within the Government between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, he has now backed down from that. He said that he did not really mean to say that, he perhaps went a bit too far with his language, and that, after all, it really was a slowdown that he was trying to have. In recent days both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have misled in a dramatic way the Australian public about the nature of the problems confronting this nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been, as I said, a major blowout in the Federal Budget. The Budget surplus for this year was estimated at Budget time to be $8.1 billion. Obviously that has gone for all time and the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, said on 31 January that the figure would now probably come in at about $4 billion for the year. Significantly, the Treasurer and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, have refused to support that figure. The Treasurer has said that he cannot put a figure on the actual outturn at this stage. Yesterday, the Leader of the Government in the Senate said much the same thing in response to a question that I asked him.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts are very clear. They are very well-exampled, listed and analysed in a report that was released two days ago by Schroders Australia Limited. Let me quote from that report, which is the most detailed analysis of the current fiscal position of the Federal Government that has been produced this year. The synopsis of that report is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth's 1990/91 Budget is likely to come in closer to balanced than the Commonwealth's revised $4 billion surplus estimate. A marked fall in employment over the first half of 1991 could see the Budget slip into deficit . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Such an outcome means a major revision of the Government's financing policy for the remainder of 1990/91. The Commonwealth will now have to issue around $7 billion of new debt to finance its Budget and meet redemptions of maturing government bonds and overseas debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report then says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The extent of the cyclical deterioration in the Commonwealth's accounts raises questions as to whether State budgets and financing requirements are coming under similar stress due to Australia's economic downturn. Certainly the starting point for next year's Commonwealth and State budgets will not seem as attractive as initial expectations for this year's outcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, if we look at the Government's own forward estimates for 1991-92 and compare them with the major deterioration both on the outlays and revenue sides of the Federal Budget this year, we can see that the problems of framing a 1991-92 Budget are absolutely horrendous. If we in Australia think that we have had economic hardship as a result of the current recession to date, compared with what will be the situation just a few months further down the track, what we are now facing is only a small portent of what is to come.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even the Treasurer's chief economic adviser during the mid-1980s, Professor Barry Hughes, who is now the Professor of Economics at the University of Newcastle, has said, in the last couple of weeks, that the recession may be worse than that of 1982-83 and there is doubt as to whether there will be any recovery at all in the Australian economy in 1991. He makes the very significant point that, to the extent that there will be a recovery at all, the pattern of that economic recovery is unlikely to be the investment and export-led event that, ideally, the country requires, because investment in equipment is weak and new work in structures will have almost disappeared. That is a view that has been echoed many times by the Opposition in recent months.
       </para>
       <para>
        The state of the Australian economy is not a result of forces outside the Government's control. The reason why we have problems in Australia today can be sheeted home only to the Federal Government. The outlook is compounded by the fact that there is a deteriorating overseas economic situation. Indeed, the forecast by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development of economic growth in the developed world for this year is a 2 per cent increase, down almost one per cent from the forecast of less than six months ago, and probably likely to be too overly optimistic anyway.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even at 2 per cent, economic growth in the developed world would be the lowest it has been since 1982. That has implications for Australia's external position where, despite the fact that we have had a recession now for more than 12 months-this economy started to go into recession at the end of 1989-and despite all the pain that has been suffered by this economy and the people of Australia for a period approaching 18 months, there has been virtually no improvement in the balance of payments; our imports continue to rise; our exports, even more worryingly, have fallen; and our competitive position has continued to deteriorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one puts those factors together with the major easing of fiscal policy that has occurred, as I have outlined in recent months, and the addition to the easing of fiscal policy caused by the blow-out in the figures of State governments, one has the seeds of a very real economic disaster.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that major expenditure and revenue reduction measures have been taken in recent months which have not yet started to impact on the economy and on the Budget. Despite that, government spending in the first six months of this year has blown out by a figure of no less than 11.5 per cent. In some areas-for example, social security expenditure-the increase in spending in the first six months of this financial year was no less than 21 per cent higher than for the same period last year. If expenditure rises by the same amount in the next six months as it did in the corresponding six months of last year, then the Budget will be out, on social security expenditure alone, by a figure in excess of $2 billion. There have been similar types of blow-outs of varying magnitudes in virtually all other areas of government expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the revenue side, the signs of meeting the Budget forecasts are equally dim. Revenue is down for the basic reason that this economy has been so crushed by the policies of this Government, that demand has fallen like a stone. Indirect tax receipts have fallen and the increase in pay as you earn income tax payments has been reduced very severely from Budget forecasts. This is because the Government, in framing this year's Budget, got it absolutely wrong in terms of the parameters on which the Budget was based, such as the rate of growth of the economy; the export performance that was expected; the inflation rate-it is going to get that wrong; and certainly the unemployment rate is going to be way out.
       </para>
       <para>
        All of the parameters on which the Budget was based have now been shown to be wrong, yet the Treasurer is failing, and has refused to date, to provide any revised forecasts of the economy for the remainder of this financial year and, therefore, any basis for judging what will be the situation within which the economy is working. The miscalculations and the disastrous policies of the Government have impacted on every Australian. The hurt to people has been very great. We are now facing record levels of bankruptcies of small businesses. Families, particularly those on single incomes and with young children, are finding it almost impossible to make ends meet. With the interest levels that they face, home buyers have been slugged almost to bankruptcy in trying to meet house repayments. The rural sector has been hit, not just at the farm level but right through provincial Australia, by these interest rate and associated policies. In terms of the hurt on individual Australians, Senator Brownhill will be saying much more later in this debate, as will Senator Walters.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to note that one of the most affected groups in Australia, as a result of these disastrous policies of this Labor Government, is those people on average weekly earnings-the ordinary hardworking Australians who have often been the traditional base for Labor votes. Just look at what this Government has done to them. Senator Kemp mentioned some of these figures in the Senate during debate prior to Christmas. They are very salutary figures and worth repeating. Senator Kemp stated that the advent of the Hawke Government had seen a very dramatic fall in after-tax earnings by average weekly wage earners. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1982-83, average male weekly earnings after tax totalled-and these are in real dollars-$475 per week. Today-eight years after the original accord; eight years after all the promises of improvements in living standards to Australian workers; eight years of a Labor Government whose main interest one would have thought would have been the welfare of Australian workers-the comparative figure has fallen by $23 per week after tax. That latest figure is based on Budget forecasts.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, those Budget forecasts will prove to be wrong and to be detrimental to those workers. Average wage earners in Australia have been decimated by this Government.

         —This is a matter of public importance, so called by the Standing Orders. Under that heading the Opposition has brought on for debate a motion which is styled:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The need for the Government to take measures, to correct the consequences of its disastrous policy miscalculations and mismanagement that have wrought hardship on all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are the Opposition's words. It has framed the motion in those terms. Given that those are the Opposition's terms, I sat here quietly for 20 minutes waiting for Senator Short, in whose name this motion appears, to say what are the measures that should be introduced now. He has not said what those measures are. He has not indicated what reforms he, as a spokesman for the Opposition on the economy, would make. If he believes his rhetoric about the parlous state of the economy-it is certainly not as good as we would like, and I will deal with that in a minute-and if he is genuinely moved by concern about it, one would have expected that the concern was not simply to be expressed as a hand-wringing exercise in criticisms of the Government but would be expressed in a constructive mode by saying what the changes would be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Short has not chosen to do that. He has chosen not to make any suggestions and not to propose any courses of action. That is not surprising to anyone who has followed the Opposition in economic debate in this country. It is not surprising because the Opposition does not have a coherent set of policies to deal with the economic management of this country. Instead, it has a political strategy aimed at attacking the short term problems of the economy and trying-as an opposition ought to, and I do not criticise it for this-to exaggerate the short term problems, talk down the possibilities of future recovery and pretend that circumstances are worse than they are.
       </para>
       <para>
        If an opposition pretends to be a government, it must have a plan for dealing with issues of economic management. We have that plan. We are seeing that plan through despite the difficulties that we face in the short term. We certainly do not want the recession that we are in but despite those difficulties we will see Australia in recovery at the end of this year and we will see a situation in which the fundamental issues of the economy, the fundamental driving engines of improvement and reform, are carried through to make sure that Australia is positioned as best it possibly can be in the world economic scene.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is predictable that the Opposition should, in this run up to 12 March, enter into parliamentary debate on a matter such as this. It is predictable because it knows that on 12 March this Government will be making a major statement on industry policy. We will be putting down a document setting the course and direction for reform of Australian industry into the next century. We will be doing that in March. The Opposition knows as well that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has indicated that he will be making a statement on the economy at the same time. The newspapers, particularly the financial press, the economic journals, have been full of comment about what those statements might contain.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is predictable that the Opposition should move before we put down an orderly, considered initiative about the changes we propose to introduce. It is not surprising that the Opposition should raise this criticism and call for some changes in an effort to pretend that it has had some influence on the policy directions of this country. It cannot have influence if it does not have a policy. The Opposition does not have a policy, it does not have influence. The Government is going down the track of the orderly reform that it is proposing. It is also predictable that the Opposition should try to make some capital out of the recession. We in the Labor Party do not want a recession. We in the Labor Party identify with the ordinary Australian, the average battler in this country, and we understand and sympathise with the difficulties a recession imposes on him.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is wrong to concentrate simply on what the problems are; it is right to concentrate on what the solutions are and the solutions will be outlined when we come to our statement. Meanwhile, the Opposition will do as it has done. The fundamental concerns of this Government are to improve the industry performance of this country and turn Australia into an exporter of manufactured goods on a scale and at a level much greater than in the past and to throw off the shackles of the somnolent years of McEwenism. That is something that the Fraser Government did not bother to tackle but it is what we have done through the steel plan, through the industry plan, through the progressive winding down of tariffs and through the exposure of Australian industry to international competition to give it the cold shock of having to deal in the international market and become more competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        As well, it is what we have done in lifting school retention rates-school retention rates increased dramatically in this country before the recession-in order to point Australia in the direction of the clever country. It is what we have done as well in massively expanding the participation rate in the work force; that is, the number of Australians between the ages of 16 and 65 who are employed.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that point, if the participation rate in this country was the same as it was in the last years of the Fraser Government, the unemployment rate on today's figures would be 2.8 per cent. That is an indication of the expansion that we have been able to effect in the number of Australians who have jobs. It is only because the gross number of Australians who have work has increased so dramatically that the unemployment figures appeared as they have. With those remarks, might I say that one of the points of common attack upon this Government in recent weeks has been the fact-and it was referred to only fleetingly, I might say, in the remarks made by Senator Short-that the Budget surplus will not come in as predicted in the Budget Papers last year. Indeed, we had a prediction of a Budget surplus in excess of $8 billion for this budgetary year. It now appears that it will be about half that, or a bit under that figure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The debate around this point suggests that somehow or other that is a reflection on our economic management. I want to say to that argument that at least we are now arguing in this country about a Budget surplus. When we took over from the previous Government, when the Treasurer was Mr Howard and the chief adviser on economic policy to him was Dr John Hewson, we came to the treasury bench in this country with a Budget deficit of over $9 billion. The difference in this debate is that we are talking about a surplus, and it is a significant surplus; and we have had a surplus four years in a row.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the surplus has declined for a couple of very interesting reasons. One of them is that the Opposition chose to knock over a government Bill to sell the Australian Pipeline Authority. Had that Bill not been knocked over, the surplus would have been at Budget level. The other thing that the Opposition did was knock out the assets test on family allowances and, had it not done that, we would have been in a position of coming closer to the predicted surplus level. So if there is any argument about the failure of this Government to deliver its surplus, the first thing that should be said is that the Opposition has taken action to deny to the Government the budgetary measures that would have enabled it to do so and it has done so in a way which is quite inequitable and unfair to ordinary Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to continue this line of analysis beyond making the next two points because it is not necessary to do so. But if there is a debate about the level of the surplus, then one would have to forget that there is extra expenditure on the Government because of the participation in the Gulf war and one would also have to ignore the fact that as a Government decision, but one rightly hailed across the broad sweep of the community, we engaged in buying out the September quarter wage round last year with a tax cut, which went to ordinary Australians on 1 January this year. This was a significant tax cut in real terms, which in fact increased the purchasing power of ordinary wage packets quite considerably. From those points of view, the debate about the surplus-should it be raised by the Opposition in this debate as an indicator of a failure of economic management-is a hollow debate and one that is bound to rebound on it. In any case, the fact that we have a significant surplus enables us to have a cushioning effect, particularly for those who are hit by unemployment, because we are maintaining vital training and educational expenditures despite the fall in tax receipts. I think those points need to be kept in mind.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I want to talk about for the next few minutes is a couple of the key areas of economic activity that the Opposition glosses over and that the leader writers in newspapers sometimes gloss over because they do not understand a wider view of how the economy interacts and works. They talk about some of the aspects of poor performance, which certainly do exist and for which we would like to see some change and achievement, but which we recognise in the context of the overall performance and not in isolation from the other effects.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me turn to the current account. In the six months to December 1990, the current account deficit fell, as honourable senators in this place would know, by 28 per cent compared to the year earlier. Imports were down by 4.2 per cent. Perhaps Senator Short will correct himself here. In the introduction of this item it was said that imports had in fact risen whereas imports were down by 4.2 per cent. It was said as well that exports had fallen whereas exports were up by 8 per cent, with manufactured exports up by 13 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe the rhetoric was not right-maybe Senator Short made a mistake when he said that imports were rising and exports were falling. If one looks at the December 1990 current account figure, the record is that imports are down and exports are up. Those figures are a healthy sign. Indeed, a table published yesterday in the Australian newspaper shows that between 1985 and 1989 manufacturing employment in Australia grew by 9 per cent-this is higher than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average; it is higher than the United States, higher than the Federal Republic of Germany, higher than Japan, and higher than the United Kingdom.
       </para>
       <para>
        It shows that Australian manufacturing exports grew by 79 per cent between 1985 and 1989 compared with the OECD average of 31 per cent. We were only shaded by the United States with a growth in manufactured goods exports of 81 per cent, but we were much higher-I emphasise this point again-than Japan, which had a growth of 8 per cent, Germany 23 per cent and the United Kingdom 32 per cent. The fundamental problem in the Australian economy is that our consumption levels have been higher than our production levels. The Australian Government's economic strategy has been to dampen consumption growth and to expand our production, to make the compensatory leap and to make a further leap into export industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now briefly to the matter of interest rates. Monetary policy has been the major discretionary weapon open to the Government to restrain economic activity. We have already run a very, very tight fiscal ship. I notice that in the speech made just a moment ago there was an inference that there is considerable room for further government cuts in expenditure. If that is the case, why does the Opposition not do as it has been invited to do consistently for some time now and itemise what social welfare programs, what part of the education budget and what part of the health budget are going to be cut so that the benefits to welfare recipients, to those in the education system and to those who rely on hospital and medical attention that are to be reduced and cut, can be identified?
       </para>
       <para>
        Why does not the Opposition come out and tell us what it means when it says that government expenditure can be cut further? Does it want to say that in the climate of crisis in the Gulf our support for the military endeavour there ought to be reduced as well? It is about time that we had from the Opposition some indication of what it means. It cannot be judged as a viable alternative to government unless it specifies what damage it will do to the welfare and standing of ordinary Australians. On the question of further government cuts, it is about time that it was more specific than it is.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, my point is that monetary policy has been the major discretionary weapon open to the Government because we have been frugal and restrained in government expenditure. We have targeted welfare more accurately. We have been more enlightened and innovative in the other areas of health and education. So we already have a very tight fiscal policy in action.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in the face of all of that, it has got to be said that the cash rates have declined by 6 per cent since the beginning of 1990 and that they could conceivably decline further. Interest rates have come down significantly and they could decline further when we make some further inroads against inflation. I know this is going to bring forth, `What about today's inflation figure?'. I listened with a great deal of attention to what Senator Button said in answer to a question about that during Question Time today. I endorse what he said absolutely.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures at the moment are pushed up artificially because of the volatility in petrol prices, given the Gulf war, and the underlying rate of inflation is still low. In fact, the next quarter's figures will show the elimination, one would hope, of the petrol price fluctuation, which will be heading down as well. So in this climate, despite nonetheless a tight fiscal policy and a hard monetary policy, we have still brought down interest rate levels by 6 per cent, and housing and mortgage rates are now at 14 1/2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have briefly referred to today's consumer price index figures. In the concluding minutes that I have I want to talk about employment. This is a subject on which any Labor government is fundamentally concerned to put its merits on the line because we want to see jobs available for all those who seek employment. Over the years of this Government, the number of people in employment has increased by 1.6 million. That has been the growth in new jobs that have been created in the period of this Government. Since 1983, our employment growth has averaged 3.5 per cent annually compared to the OECD, all the advanced countries of the world, of 1.7 per cent. We averaged 3.5 per cent and they averaged 1.7 per cent. That is our performance compared to them. During the 1982 recession, unemployment rose from 6.8 per cent to 10.1 per cent in the 10 months to April 1983. Under this Government, unemployment has been reduced from 10.2 per cent to 8.1 per cent, and in our view it is still too high. The participation rate, the number of people actually in the work force, is much higher. The figure is 63.9 per cent compared to 60.4 per cent during the Fraser years. As I said earlier, if we had the same participation rate today as we had in 1983, then on our figures the unemployment rate would be 2.8 per cent.

       <para>
        I will conclude by talking briefly about the Australian Labor Party-Australian Council of Trade Unions wages accord, which has been significant in restraining wage growth in this country. It has enabled the Government to manage the incomes of ordinary Australians by giving tax cuts, and to manage the value of the income they then have by introducing Medicare and other services, particularly for those at the lower end of the income levels in this country. This has meant that they have been better off as a consequence-the value of the money they have has gone further.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nonetheless, the Government has a wages policy; by contrast, the Opposition has no wages policy other than some vague idea of pushing the number of unions into the thousands by introducing enterprise unionism; re-embracing the high disputation levels of industrial disputes, in which Australians were set against Australians during the Fraser years; and turning over our massive achievement of reducing industrial disputation by 61 per cent from what used to apply during the Fraser years. The Opposition has done those things while restraining wage levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition comes in here and talks about how real wages have fallen. Real wages have fallen, but real household disposable income per capita-that is, the amount of money in a household-has risen. If we take the real wage measure we see that real wages have fallen, but if we take the value of money in terms of wages, taxes and benefits supplied to the community, we see that real household disposable income per capita, per individual in the household, has risen during our period of government. That is a significant achievement. It is not an achievement that is as high as we would like. We would have liked to have seen more done on that front, but we have been supporting significant and massive change in terms of industry policy to improve the wealth creation mechanisms of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, we will be making a major statement on how we intend to take the next round of the course on 12 March. When we put down our industrial policy statement on 12 March, followed by an economic statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Opposition will see the measures of a progressive, forward-looking government caught by a recession that it did not want. This Government is in a position to say how it intends to effect a recovery in the second half of this year so that ordinary Australians can be better off. We can do it by managing wages policy, as we will continue to do, and we can do it by managing on all the other economic fronts I have talked about. The Opposition will have to watch this space to hear those reports on 12 March.

         —Today the Senate is debating the following matter of urgency:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The need for the Government to take measures to correct the consequences of its disastrous policy miscalculations and the mismanagement which have wrought hardship to all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), I have listened in vain to Senator Short. I have failed to gain some knowledge from him on the measures that the Opposition intends to advocate in the terms of the topic that has been put forward today. I should say at the outset that the Australian Democrats will vote for the motion. We will vote for the motion not because we necessarily agree with the Opposition which is totally unable to propose alternative measures; we will vote for it because we did not agree with the policies of the Government which have brought the Australian community to this low ebb of economic activity and the social hardship which people are now experiencing. It is common ground that Australia is in a recession engineered by the Government, aided and abetted by the Opposition. The Opposition did not oppose the policy of high interest rates, and it continued to argue that farmers, home buyers and workers should be delivered to the mercies of the non-value market economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Deregulation is as much a religion for the Opposition as it continues to be for the Government, but whenever the Government retreats and agrees under pressure to some measures to assist exporters, farmers and small business people, the Opposition continues to say that we should stick to deregulation and we should not weaken even if the economic and social costs become horrendous. The economy is bad and this is clearly illustrated by the fact that unemployment has increased by 250,000 people since October 1989. Retail turnover declined in real terms by 3.5 per cent in November 1990 and is still trending downwards-an ominous sign for the economy as well as for those people engaged in the retail industry. Bankruptcies have skyrocketed to 3,000 in the December quarter, compared with 1,874 in the previous December quarter, a rise of 56 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The annual change in the volume of money has collapsed from the speculative binge of the late 1980s level of nearly 20 per cent down to 7 per cent. It would appear that the banks have overreacted somewhat due to their massive bad debts and they are actually rationing credit even though interest rates have dropped considerably. Lower official interest rates simply are not being fully passed on to home buyers or small businesses. In fact, the banks are now operating on historically high margins of between 3.5 and 4 per cent, more than double the accepted international average.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that bank deregulation, as part of the overall deregulation binge, has contributed severely to the boom as well as to the current bust. Until recently we thought that bad debts, which I believe is a better, more honest term than `non-performing loans', were largely the major contribution of the banks to this boom and bust. Last night Senator Paul McLean of the Australian Democrats documented further problems. He was prevented from doing so fully and in the sort of detail that public interest considerations demand. Unfortunately it goes further than bad debts. It would appear that the unrestrained greed that we have been exposed to by deregulation has really taken over in the banking sector and was a major contributor in the disasters that we are now facing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the most important social consequence of the economic recession that we are now in is the level of unemployment. In seasonally adjusted terms, the rate of unemployment rose from 5.9 per cent in December 1989 to 8.1 per cent in December 1990. It is generally agreed that the rate will continue to rise for much of the current calendar year. A sharp rise, something like a 50 per cent increase in the ratio of unemployed persons to job vacancies in the latter half of 1990, would seem to indicate that we have a long way to go before we see an upturn.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of particular concern must be the position of young people in our society, and here we have a rapid deterioration in the youth labour market with a rate of unemployment among persons aged 15 to 19 rising from 15.1 per cent in December 1989 to 23 per cent in December last year. Similarly, if we compare that rate with the rate for another group of people who are particularly disadvantaged in our society, we see that the rate of unemployment of Aboriginal people is currently in most areas nearing-and in some in excess of-50 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        To summarise, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, an estimated 176,000 Australians were retrenched in 1990, doubling the rate of 1989. This has had very distinctive consequences on employment in particular industries and various enterprises. The bad news continues to come in. In November Westpac, one of the banks, reduced its computer and administrative staff by 60 and the ANZ bank announced its plan to reduce its operations by 1,000 staff in 1991. The Commonwealth Bank is reported as planning to cut its recruitment by up to 2,000 over the next 12 months. The banks at least are going to ensure that they will not suffer by the bust they have contributed to. Nissan Australia has announced it will sack 750 staff and stop production for 18 days between early March and late April. Ford Australia has announced that it will cut a further 1,600 jobs from its Melbourne and Geelong plants on top of cuts already announced in late 1990. Australian Airlines is reported to be offering a redundancy package to 1,500 workers as part of a restructuring of its operations. Qantas has asked some staff to go on leave without pay and it is reported that 500 jobs are to be axed by the end of February.
       </para>
       <para>
        These job losses are reflected in the social consequences that our society faces. The Victorian Council of Social Service report of last April, entitled Off the Street Begging and the Australian Social Security System, reports that it:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . estimated . . . 30 per cent of Victorian pensioners and beneficiaries were forced to request emergency relief during 1987/88 . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, it found:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . unemployment beneficiaries and sole parent pensioners were overrepresented among emergency relief recipients-
       </para>
       <para>
        and no wonder. It also found:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . current waiting periods for pensions and benefits were causing significant hardship with around 50 Victorian individuals and families per week seeking emergency relief while waiting for unemployment benefits . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        One of my colleagues, Senator Lees, from South Australia, last year talked at length with the Superintendent of the Brisbane City Mission, Reverend O'Connor, and he made an observation to her about the problems his organisation was facing as more and more people requested assistance. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Brisbane City Mission having served in the Valley for the past one hundred and thirty one years has now turned full cycle. Whereas in those early days we worked with convicts deported for stealing as little as a loaf of bread, we are today involved with children stealing food in order to survive.
       </para>
       <para>
        The time has come for the Government to take action rather than abdicate responsibility and leave it up to markets dominated by foreign financiers. We need a carefully targeted policy of industry incentives combined with an equally careful partial re-regulation of the financial system to boost national savings, to contain imports and to ensure that Australia's economic policies are integrated with our environmental and social justice objectives. Private greed of the type we have seen in the last few years must never again be allowed to damage the national interest as the unrestrained overseas borrowings of the paper entrepreneurs did during the 1980s.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need a determined effort to boost exports and reduce imports. That is one of the highest priorities in the Australian Democrats' economic package to beat this recession. This will include export incentives and measures to increase the capacity of Australian industry and primary producers to compete in overseas markets. We believe that industry should be enabled to improve productivity through measures such as accelerated depreciation allowances for major export oriented projects, one of the recommendations of the Australian Manufacturing Council. I could not suppress a smile when the Council said, on the one hand, that deregulation should be allowed to continue, mirroring somewhat the views of some commentators-certainly, to a large extent, those of the Opposition and, perhaps to a slightly lesser extent now, of the Government-that we really cannot admit our mistakes and must continue to pay at least token respect to the concept of deregulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        An item that appeared in the Australian on 9 February quoted an Australian Chamber of Manufactures' submission as saying that deregulation needs to be `managed' to overcome these disadvantages. One cannot have it both ways. One either leaves it up to the market or one uses carefully targeted intervention to bring about the sorts of results that our economy and our society need.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from measures to assist industry, such as the accelerated depreciation allowance that I mentioned, we need measures to encourage exporters to boost their efforts. Our policy would include a 5 per cent bounty on the value of new exports. Before the cry of `Where's the money coming from?' goes up, let me say that, on the basis of last year's figures of new exports of some $2.8 billion, it would be an expenditure of an additional $140m to double our new exports-surely a worthwhile investment. We believe also that the current export development schemes should be supported and increased and we regret that our amendments to the export development grants scheme legislation, which sought to do that, were not supported by either old party.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are particularly concerned about primary producers and believe it is high time that the anti-dumping procedures, which are antiquated, slow and nearly worthless, were overhauled. We believe it absolutely necessary that the onus of proof be reversed. We believe that, if foreign countries choose to dump at our doorstep products which are clearly way below production costs on a prima facie basis, it should be up to them to prove that they are not dumping the products and that they are engaging in what might be called `fair competition'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me address the major problem I believe we are facing. The Government and the Opposition seem to believe that we must deliver our farmers up to the mercy of the world markets in the hope of getting the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round of negotiations to the point where they prevail upon some of the countries in the European Community, and the United States, to reduce their massive subsidies, some of which are as high as 40 per cent, to their primary producers. It seems to the Australian Democrats that, while we are prepared to allow other countries to engage in such practices, we should help our farmers until those countries too are prepared to come to the table.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other measures I believe we should take-that is, in our legal and regulatory system. We should ask the Reserve Bank to supervise our financial system and to control the taking up of high loans from overseas lenders.

        The need for the Government to take measures to correct the consequences of its disastrous policy miscalculations . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        And how disastrous they have been. We can have no better proof of those disastrous policy miscalculations and their consequences than the recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) Agricultural Outlook Conference figures. They are a litany of doom and gloom for agriculture, and one industry after another is going down the chute. Agriculture is under a lot of stress and strain. Let me range through just a few industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the sugar industry, 12 months ago ABARE was predicting that world sugar prices would continue to rise throughout 1991 and they are now at their lowest level since 1988 after a 40 per cent collapse. Grape prices have fallen 50 per cent as wine sales falter, and the industry is blaming a depressed economy. In the rice industry, the Australian production costs are creating increasing difficulties for growers to compete fairly with imports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The price of wheat is at its lowest for 60 years. Let us look at what happens to the poor old wheat farmer with a government impost of indexation of the fuel excise, for example, and the increase in fuel prices. In the forest products industry, slower economic growth in Australia is the major reason for the forecast general decline in the consumption of forest products, according to ABARE. The timber industry, for example, cannot even get a guarantee from this Government concerning access to forests in the future. In the dairy industry, prices paid to Australian producers of manufacturing milk are forecast to decline in 1990-91. We can see what high interest rates do to the dairy industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now let us look at wool. The wool industry is in confusion and chaos, with debts of nearly $3 billion and rising. This year the woolgrower will get some 30 per cent of what he got a year or so ago. Let us look at the chaos that has been created in that industry by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, travelling the world and saying that the 700c reserve price scheme was immutable and would not be changed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our export industries are in a disastrous state and have fallen dramatically in value in the last year or two. Wheat exports have gone down from $2.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Mutton exports have gone down from $204m last year to $141m this year. We can go through the litany of our export industries. They are all down. They are down as a result of the pressures put on them by the Government which is presently in power in Canberra and rules Australia-eight years of a litany of government problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are some bare economic facts. Let me give the Senate some other results of eight years of Labor being in power in Australia. For example, 54 per cent of sheep properties have liquid assets worth less than their debt. As I have already said, their incomes will drop by 70 per cent this year. Broad acre farmers are in exactly the same position. Let me give the Senate an example of the chaos that has been created by this Government. Let us try to imagine ourselves as woolgrowers. A specialist woolgrower has no other income; he just grows wool. He shears once a year and sells once a year. He prepares his budget for his bank and his accountant based on what he knows and his expected returns. Up till last year that was not too hard to do; it was reasonably easy. But this year it has become extremely difficult-beyond the pale.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us say that the specialist woolgrower sells his wool every February. He sold last year with a floor price of 870c clean and an 8 per cent wool tax. He based his 1991 budget on that. Last October he was forced to revise his budget based on the 700c floor price and a tax of 25 per cent-a tax that was put on last June. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said that it was an immutable price; that the 700c reserve price scheme would stay-it was immutable for the next two seasons. Let us look at the chaos that that created for the wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The woolgrower shore his sheep in January amidst speculation about quotas, slaughter schemes and thousands of other rumours. Let us not forget that he has no options for other income. He responsibly tried to cull his old ewes and hoped for the best. He tried to sell his wool last week and was told that the sales were off. He does not know what he will get for this year's work or when he will get it. His budget is out the back door. The kids might have to leave school. It is very good to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) in the chamber to listen to this debate. I know that he is interested in this area and in the tax area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The woolgrower has his quarterly provisional tax payments to make. He might have to pay some of his income tax as well. The quarterly payment of provisional tax, of course, was a Government initiative. The farmer is wondering how he will get his income, because there have been no wool sales. I have written to the Parliamentary Secretary asking for something to be done about those people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wheat growers are in a lot of trouble as well. Their incomes are down dramatically. In many cases, that is because of the fuel costs and the costs of running their properties. In my own district, I have an example of a gentleman talking about interest rates. This gentleman is Mr Keith Norman. I quote from the Land newspaper, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Facing bills of $200,000 this year for interest payments, living expenses and the cost of growing his crops, and with no income since the middle of last year, he is counting on this summer's sorghum, sunflowers and corn to get him through till Christmas.
       </para>
       <para>
        And, of course, he has just had a big flood. The point is that he is blaming the sustained interest rate rises for the problems that he is having in his industry. Interest rates have hurt all farmers. They do not just hurt the people who have overdrafts; they hurt all farmers for the simple fact that they have to put an input into producing things on their properties. Those interest rates have permeated the whole of the economy so that input costs have risen. They have not come down, although bank overdraft interest rates have come back slightly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party-I do not quite know what it is trying to do to the rural industries-has imposed high interest rates on Australian farmers that will be there for ever and a day. As I said, they are built into the whole system now, and I cannot over-emphasise that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Farmers can and do face adversity well. Farmers in New South Wales alone have faced fires, floods and all the other things they have had come at them, including the things that the Labor Party has thrown at them. It is affecting the towns. The machinery dealers in the towns are being affected by high interest rates. The fact, of course, is that there is now no investment allowance to give people an initiative to buy machinery anyway. Look at what the Government has done with the depreciation allowance for fencing and housing on farms. Depreciation allowances have gone from the previous 20 per cent down to 5 per cent. The whole time, business overheads-the input into running properties-have been forced up by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) says, the economy is in a home-grown recession; it is all the Labor Party's own work and it is bringing this country to its knees. I agree with him. Mr Keating said, `This is the recession we had to have'. I can tell the Senate that that leaves me rather cold-very cold indeed. There is a very cold feeling amongst farmers and businessmen, whose life's work has been taken away by banks and mortgage holders. It is not, after all, Mr Keating who has been adversely affected by this recession; it is the ordinary, good, law-abiding citizens of this country who have been hit left, right and centre.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Kerin has said that the outlook for Australian agriculture is subdued. God help us when he decides that the situation is serious. Certainly, the Federal Government's attempts at solving the problems have been subdued. They have to date amounted to minor fiddles with tax rates and vague threats to banks to encourage them to lower home loan interest rates. Tax cuts, of course, do not mean anything to people who are not earning income at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        When will the Government get to work and do something about real reform of the taxation system instead of titivating it round the edges and let the Australian people do with their money what they want rather than Canberra taking a bigger and tougher grab at the meagre profits that we sometimes make? I have the concurrence of Senator Cook to incorporate a document of what we would do in government and what this Government must do. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard these policy imperatives put out by Dr Hewson.
       </para>
       <para>
        Leave granted.

       <para>
        The document read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        WHAT GOVERNMENT MUST DO-POLICY IMPERATIVES
       </para>
       <para>
        There are at least eight fundamental structural policy changes which must be implemented:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. Taxation Reform
       </para>
       <para>
        We must have a simpler tax system that gives incentive to Australians to work harder, earn more and save. That means less tax overall and a bias in the tax system towards saving rather than spending. Government spending must be cut significantly (we have already identified spending cuts of $3 billion) to fund lower taxes. The broad-based consumption tax advocated by the Treasurer in 1985 and supported by the Opposition should be introduced with the result that personal income tax rates can be lowered significantly, wholesale sales taxes abolished, the `black' economy taxed and taxes on business inputs removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Labour Market Reform
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government must abandon the Accord which has eroded real incomes, propped up inflation and given the ACTU too much power. A shift away from the rigid centralised system to true enterprise bargaining will lift productivity and give the workforce and employers an incentive to reach agreement on pay and conditions which will suit the needs of the enterprise and its employees and give them a better chance of holding their jobs through the recession. In addition, voluntary unionism and secret strike ballots will give workers more self-responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. Efficient Infrastructure
       </para>
       <para>
        Inefficiencies in telecommunications, transport, shipping, the waterfront and power generation impose major cost disadvantages on Australian industry trying to export or compete against imports. The answer is to inject proper competition into these sectors of the economy by opening up markets to newcomers and breaking down inefficient work and management practices, reducing regulations and reducing the hold that unions have on many of these activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Reform of Government Operations
       </para>
       <para>
        Contracting out of Government services to the private sector can bring savings of up to 20%. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth and the States must agree quickly on the appropriate distribution of taxing powers and on cutting out areas of duplication of service so that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently.
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        Sleepy, inefficient Government-owned monopolies must be shaken up through exposure to competition and privatisation. The Government's halfhearted approach to privatisation must change so the full benefits of privatisation-efficiency gains, better service and lower consumer costs-are realised.

        6. Industry Reform
       </para>
       <para>
        Orderly and pre-specified reductions in protection (protection shields Australian industry from the stimulus of international competition) are an integral part of an economic reform package. With a more efficient economy, protection will become less and less necessary. Without economic reforms, industry will still try to lean on the crutch of protection and pass on the costs to Australia's export industries and Australian consumers.

       <para>
        7. Immigration
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has failed to administer immigration guidelines effectively and has undermined the integrity of our immigration programme. Standards have been lowered to achieve annual targets. It is essential that existing migration criteria be enforced and the integrity of our programme restored. In the short term, as the recession makes Australia less attractive to skilled migrants and our economy has a reduced capacity to absorb migrants, the overall level of immigration will fall. However in the longer term, increased immigration will be of substantial economic benefit. Australia should retain its commitment to family reunion and refugee programmes.

       <para>
        8. Environment and Development
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government must urgently set out clear and consistent guidelines to achieve an appropriate balance between development and conservation of the environment. An essential part of this is an effective policy on resource security. Once appropriate environmental standards are set, export producing projects like Coronation Hill and Wesley Vale must be allowed to go ahead if they are commercially viable.

         —I make a couple of points about labour market reform. The Labor Party needs a fair bit of reform too. In fact, it needs as much reform as anything else around here. I will give a couple of examples of the need for labour market reform. Senator Cook said that there had been a fair bit of effort and that some progress had been made. At home the Gunnedah abattoir is a great example of why we need reform. The Australian meat industry is riddled with labour rorts. Sheep are selling at about 30c a head, if it is possible to get that much. Meat inspectors are asking for wage rises of 68 per cent and expect to be paid even when they have no full time work. On top of that, their union is claiming that there ought to be more of them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At the Tamworth abattoirs we have the opposite. Meat workers have an agreement with management. The result is that the abattoir is profitable for the first time in its history. The workers are being paid more than they ever have been. The management is delighted with the throughput. One would think that the unions would be happy that workers were satisfied. But no, the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union is now claiming that the men at Tamworth are earning too much and working too fast. The union is demanding increased staffing when clearly there is no need for more staff.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will compare abattoir costs in Australia to those in other parts of the world. In Australia it costs $111 per beast just for labour costs to slaughter and pack. In the United States of America it costs $36 to do the same job. In Uruguay, one of our big competitors, it costs $56. The total cost per beast in an export plant in the United States is $88; in Australia, $193. How will we compete unless this Government does something about it?
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of automation, there has been an 8 per cent productivity increase in the poultry industry in the last 20 years. In the cattle and sheep abattoirs there has been a 1.8 per cent productivity increase but only a 1.6 per cent real growth increase in the throughput. That is all to do with tally systems and some of the other problems associated with the work force in those abattoirs.

        Until this Government bites the bullet and introduces labour market reform, taxation reform, and an efficient infrastructure, until it reforms government operations, until it does something about privatisation, and until it reforms industry, this country will not prosper the way it should. There is only one way that this country will prosper and that, of course, is to change the government of the day, but we have to wait some time for that. This urgency motion has been brought forward by Senator Short to tell this Government to get on and do something about it now.

        Being in government while the country is in recession is economically undesirable and it has undesirable social consequences; nobody should deny that. Therefore, everybody seeking to speak in this debate has an obligation to consider the causes of that recession or the circumstances in which we find ourselves and its consequences, and to make some proposals about its solutions. If one reads the urgency motion that is what one expects the debate to be about. Senator Short failed to do that altogether. Senator Cook has dealt with that. Senator Brownhill got to it in the very last moment. He did incorporate a document, I suspect perhaps because he realised he had forgotten to make any positive suggestions. So he came along and sought to incorporate the same old tired document from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).
       </para>
       <para>
        There were two points that Senator Brownhill made to which I refer, one because he is rehashing an old argument without keeping up with the facts and the other because he raised an important issue of tax, which he has indicated he has written to me about. I am not aware of the letter but I understand the issue. I will say something positive about that.
       </para>
       <para>
        He put a lot of emphasis on the problem caused for the rural industry by high interest rates. Of course, nobody could argue that, for anybody running any business on overdraft or similar facility, the lower the interest rates the better for that person. That is beyond question. The Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, toured rural Australia for some time. He talked about his 10-80 solution. He said that the key thing for the Australian Government to do was to get interest rates down to 10 per cent and get the value of the Australian dollar down below 80c. Suddenly he stopped talking about it because interest rates are down. The 90-day bill rate is now down to 11.5 per cent and the value of the Australian dollar is 77c. He is now trying to find a new benchmark. He has suddenly realised that he set a benchmark that has virtually been achieved and he needs to try to find some new basis for his concern. We have to put that into some sort of perspective.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding that criticism and the emptiness of the rest of the contribution, I acknowledge Senator Brownhill's concern raised about quarterly provisional tax. I do not in any way apologise for the generalised policy of quarterly provisional tax. The closer that people paying provisional tax are brought to the same circumstances as Australians on pay as you earn, the better. But clearly that provisional tax always causes potential concern for people when their income, because of circumstances beyond their control, or even if it is within their control, falls dramatically during the course of the year. This has potential to cause serious consequences.

        Let us look at what has been said about the causes of this recession and the alternative analyses made by the Opposition at the time and even now, with the virtue of 20 : 20 hindsight. Let us go through what the Opposition said when various initiatives were taken by the Government and see whether the Opposition predicted or in some way foresaw what is construed as the miscalculation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As most students of economics will acknowledge, the origins of the current international economic circumstances lie in the 1987 crash of the stock market and the loosening of interest rates that followed. The Opposition overwhelmingly agreed with that loosening of interest rates at that time-and quite properly, because that is what was done in every modern Western economy because people were concerned about the ripple effect of the stock market crash. In fact, Senator Stone predicted that it was pointless doing that because it was inevitable that a recession would follow the 1987 crash. He also, with everybody else, acknowledged that we should do what we could to accommodate the business community so that the recession would not follow.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of the need to reduce demand which arose as a consequence of the loosening and the boom which followed in 1989, who argued that there was no need to reduce demand? Nobody that I know, and certainly not the Opposition. We had legitimate debate about the methods and mechanism, because the Opposition always relies on cutting fiscal policy and cutting wages. The Opposition has to rely on pressure on fiscal policy because it has no anti-inflationary policy. Furthermore, it always looks to tighten wages policy as a euphemism for reducing wages because it does not have a wages policy. That is the fundamental reason why the Opposition does not have an anti-inflation policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Opposition members never acknowledge that fiscal policy is already tight, the tightest ever, and that wages policy is remarkably tight. The only way in which what they talk of as a change of wages policy could allow for an easing of interest rates would have been if that policy had delivered lower wage outcomes. So Opposition members cannot stand here and express concern that wages may not have risen fast enough, as Senator Short purported to do, and then say that we should have had a tighter wages policy. They cannot do this and then oppose every wage increase that has been granted, including the $12 increase that is coming. They cannot have it both ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us talk about the timing of the loosening. One of the miscalculations, as would now be accepted, is that perhaps monetary policy was loosened too late. What happened? In January 1990 when the Government first loosened monetary policy, did the Opposition say, `You are too late. Why did you not do it earlier?'. No, Dr Hewson, the then Opposition Treasury spokesman, said that lower rates could not be sustained, that we were pushing the pace and going too fast. That was said on 23 January 1990. On 1 February he said that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was still forcing the pace. Then on 15 February he said that these reductions were a blatant political act, that we were taking this course not because underlying economic circumstances required it but because it was required politically.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the most recent easing of monetary policy, in November, the shadow Treasury spokesman, Mr Reith, said that we should not be loosening interest rates because it would only lead to higher interest rates. Again, on 18 December he expressed concern that the recovery would be too strong as a result of the interest rate cut.
       </para>
       <para>
        Opposition members cannot be concerned about the consequences of the slow pace at which we ease monetary policy and then, each time we ease it, oppose such a course because it is thought to be too soon and will lead to a demand resurgence. Unless those opposite wish to remain a permanent Opposition, which would be delightful from my point of view, they cannot continue to have it both ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        I acknowledge that for this or any other government, or indeed for academics, economists and commentators, economics and economic prediction are very imperfect arts. Economics is unpredictable because it is based on an assessment of human reactions. Sometimes we cannot even assess the nature of that reaction, let alone the rate, because there is feedback in the system which needs to be accommodated. There are lags and problems of obtaining appropriate information. There are conflicting pressures, as in the housing market at present. We have the upward pressure of declining interest rates and the downward pressure of concern about unemployment. So economics is an imprecise art. There are unforeseen considerations and new factors that come in to reinforce or detract-considerations such as the problems of the wool and wheat industries and international uncertainty.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is also the case in the current timing of the prediction of the upturn. There is no doubt that the preconditions for an upturn have been created. There is no doubt that during the course of this calendar year we shall see the first signs of that. But nobody can precisely predict when that will take place; only that it certainly will.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this enthusiasm for gloom, let us not forget that there is gain from the pain. The current account is 30 per cent better than it was in the same period 12 months ago, notwithstanding falling export prices. Compared to a year earlier, in the six months to December, imports were 4.2 per cent lower, exports were 8 per cent higher, manufactured exports were in fact 13 per cent higher and the current account deficit was 28 per cent lower. That is not a recipe for complacency that everything is resolved but it does suggest that important improvements are taking place.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the topic of inflation, today we got a bad inflation number but the underlying inflation rate is improving. I challenge the Opposition which said today that this inflation number was totally a product of our policy and a sign of failure. Did Opposition members acknowledge three months ago, when we had a remarkably good figure, that that was totally the result of our good policy and an accurate description of the situation? Of course they did not, because they do not fall for the sin of having a logical mind and being consistent. That is not a problem that confronts them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also challenge Opposition members to say now that they will accept that the next two inflation figures, which I predict will be very good ones, will be products of our economic policy. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that a high number is our fault but that the low numbers are a coincidence. The fact is that we will have not just some beneficial consequences of the fact that recessions ease demand pressure and therefore inflation falls but fundamental changes in the underlying inflation rate have been consistently flowing through for more than 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        Increasing unemployment is a very difficult issue for any government, particularly a Labor government, to confront. It is a bad economic indicator but it is also very significant for the individuals and the families who are affected. Let nobody underestimate that. That is an inevitable adverse consequence every time one has to slow down demand, particularly when circumstances tip the economy over into a recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have to recognise two things. This follows on a period of record employment growth in this country. Nothing equivalent has occurred for 40 years. We are still net 1.6 million jobs better off than we were before. If the participation rate were as it was when we came to office, the unemployment rate would be 2.8 per cent. That would still be too high because there are too many individuals adversely affected and it is a concern because it is rising. But let us not deny the reality of those figures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us talk about whether there will be an improvement next year. I think inevitably all the indicators will say so and all the sensible forecasters are saying so. The Westpac forecast for 1992 is that the real GDP growth percentage will be 2.8 per cent and inflation for the fiscal year 1992 will be 4 per cent, after an inflation figure of 4.5 per cent this year. So there is the potential to break the back of inflation and inflationary expectations in Australia. This will create the circumstances where the cost of capital to Australian companies will be competitive with that of other countries with which we compete and will start to make a fundamental change in the nature of Australia's economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need to look at the context of the difficult circumstances in which Australia finds itself. There is a recession not only in Australia but also in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada. We are following a record period of employment growth, underlying inflation is falling and there is a trend improvement in current account deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        We reject the alternatives of increasing prices through a consumption tax, increasing unemployment through an attack on fiscal policy, abandoning an anti-inflationary strategy and, as I said, being required to squash growth--

         —The latest inflation figure just announced for this quarter of 2.7 per cent is a tragedy for Australia. Unfortunately, it underlines the horrific mess this Government has made of our wonderful country. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) on this occasion has stopped short of referring to it as a set of wonderful, beautiful figures. This time he has blamed the Gulf war, he has blamed the States for incurring extra taxation, indeed, he will blame anything that he can put his mind to, except his own incompetence. Of course, if the Government starves the States of money then, naturally, the States will have to raise their costs.

       <para>
        Instead of the inflation rate going down as Mr Hawke promised us-and we remember that last year he said that we could have a slowing down and it would be about 6 per cent-it is now running at 10.8 per cent and there is nothing to tell me that the next couple of quarters, as Senator McMullan has said, are going to be any better. Financially, there is no light at the end of the tunnel to give me such confidence, and Senator McMullan keeps talking about an underlying inflation rate of 5.6 per cent. Where he gets it from I do not know.
       </para>
       <para>
        The unemployment figure is due out tomorrow. I wonder what that will be. This time last year Mr Hawke said that the underlying figure would be 6 per cent. He said we can have a slowdown without unemployment occurring. He expected it to be about 6 per cent-it is now 8.1 per cent and the figures come out tomorrow. Senator Richardson has already said that the numbers are rocketing. He says that the Budget estimate of 475,000 people will be wrong-it will be out of kilter.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the moment, those two promises from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are absolutely scuttled. How tragic it is that it took until last Sunday for the Prime Minister to acknowledge that he was wrong and say, `We have got it wrong'. How tragic it is that it took Mr Keating until Monday to come out and apologise that he had caused all this pain to the Australian people. Remember his recession that we had to have-the recession he personally engineered.
       </para>
       <para>
        How tragic it is that the Government was so insensitive, pig-headed and egotistical that it would not listen to the Opposition or take any notice of it, month after month, year after year, pleading to change course. Not only that, but the Government also ignored the advice of its only Minister for Finance with any courage until, finally, he resigned in frustration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, how tragic it is that ordinary Australians who showed faith in the Hawke Government have never been told the truth about the mismanagement that has caused the suffering and the pain of seeing their life savings and investments disappearing before their eyes.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the Prime Minister and Mr Keating to so belatedly tell the truth, admit they were wrong and say, `I am sorry', is not good enough. Too many people have lost their life savings. Too many people have been thrown on the dole. As the previous Labor Finance Minister said, it is a result of almost wilful mismanagement of our economy by the Keating-Kelty combination.
       </para>
       <para>
        If Mr Hawke and Mr Keating think that all will be swept under the carpet and their apologies will be accepted on 12 March when they make their economic statement, apologising to Australia for wrecking the economy, sending people broke and having families sell their homes, then they are in a fool's paradise. Why should any businessman who has indulged in impeccable business management be forced to the wall because he borrowed money at 10 per cent and did not take into account, or foresee, that the Government could increase interest rates to over double that at which he borrowed, just because the Treasurer needed a recession? How can businessmen possibly invest under such circumstances? How can they plan?
       </para>
       <para>
        Why should 1,700 workers be sacked by the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd because interest rates were so high-Mr Keating kept them so high-that the motor vehicles cannot be sold in Australia? If we cannot afford to buy them here why can we not export them? Why can we not export more vehicles to New Zealand? With interest rates as high as they are we should not have been left with this tremendous cost.

        Does the Senate realise that it is cheaper to ship cars from Melbourne to Auckland on the open route via Japan, than direct from Melbourne to Auckland? It is cheaper to go halfway round the world than it is to send them direct, using our flagships. Let there be no misunderstanding, Australia is not following the world's slowdown. It has not been forced on us; it has not touched us yet. We have been well ahead of the world's slowdown. Mr Keating has engineered his own recession. Because of the world's slowdown, we will have a far deeper and longer recession than would otherwise have been the case. Mr Hawke has admitted that as world demand for our goods slows down our problems will increase.

        Let me deal with just a few of the Government's policies that have created the mess we are in. As I say, there have been 1,700 sackings from Ford in Victoria; 153 from BTR Engineering (Australia) Ltd, an Albury plant; and Nissan Motor Manufacturing Company (Australia) Ltd today announced that it is sacking 750 people. Why is this happening? It is because the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, will not accept his responsibility and do something about the waterfront.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does he realise the consequence of these massive sackings? The blue-collar workers are being thrown out and put on the dole just because he cannot get his act together. The waterside unions have got him bluffed and they will not allow foreign flagships to take over from the Australian flagships plying our coast. The work practices that have been gained through blackmail and holding up ships in ports have devastated our transport costs. The consequences are financially and socially unacceptable to those vehicle workers, yet we know that the trade union movement, particularly on the waterside, says it will not tolerate any lowering of employment or alterations of its work practices.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its annual report for 1989 the Industries Assistance Commission stated that reform of our waterfront, coastal shipping, roads, rail and aviation industry-that is, our transport system-would boost our gross domestic product by $9 billion a year, yet nothing has been done. The Government is plainly incompetent. The Minister who promised to resign-that is, Senator Collins-if he could not make substantial changes to the waterfront within 12 months, should carry out that promise and resign now. But I guess, like the rest of the Government, if he keeps to form, in 12 months time he will end up just saying, `I am sorry, I couldn't accomplish it'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us have a look at a few of the apologies that have been made by the Government. Do honourable senators remember Mr Hawke's promise that no child would live in poverty by the year 1990? Yet in March 1990 Mr Hawke acknowledged that there were still 400,000 children living in poverty. Just because Mr Keating wanted a recession, there was no money available to lift their living standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hawke promised to do something about street children and drugs. Large amounts of money were spent on public relations exercises, but nothing was done about the street children and the drug problem. It has all just escalated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Remember the best health care system in the world-Medicare? We had a firm promise that Australians had been given the best health care available. It is a pity, while all these apologies and breast beatings are going on, that the Government does not apologise for the mess of its health system. Despite the Government trying to contain costs by limiting beds, the health budget continues to blow out. We have ended up with pensioners and low income earners without any pull, without knowing whom they should approach, having to compete with the well-heeled in the community for a bed in public hospitals. There are no prizes for guessing who wins and who ends up on the waiting lists. We have pensioners waiting several years to have hip replacements while those who can afford to insure themselves get their hip done immediately. Last September the new Minister for Health, Brian Howe, called for massive spending on the public sector projects such as hospitals when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The public sector cannot withstand continuing application of the intellectually lazy approach of ever-tightening funding producing ever-increasing discipline and efficiencies.
       </para>
       <para>
        In response Mr Keating said:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no prospect of massive increases on public spending.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Keating had to have his recession. He was engineering it. Everything had to slow down. Wherever we go around Australia, the signs of the recession are very obvious for all to see. Mr Keating may well have said that he is sorry but people are selling their homes and their properties, and the family runabout and trailer are out the front-all at bargain basement prices because the family's assets have fallen through the floor. People are scared stiff as they see the unemployment notices going out. People are terrified as they see bankruptcy headlines such as, `Western Australian bankruptcies leap by 100 per cent, Victoria 65 per cent, New South Wales 62 per cent'-all because the Government could not manage the economy, all because it had to interfere in the floating of the dollar, all because it had to keep tight control on interest rates rather than using other methods.
       </para>
       <para>
        One after another the State banks of the Labor Government have gone broke-in Victoria and Western Australia, and now South Australia. I cannot believe for one minute that Mr Keating, with all the facilities available to him, with his access to the Reserve Bank of Australia, and with his colleague the Premier of South Australia, had no knowledge of this occurring, yet the Opposition in South Australia had been asking questions for over six months. We just cannot believe the Treasurer in this instance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The people have had enough. They no longer believe the Government. They will not accept the Prime Minister's apologies. They will not accept the Treasurer's apologies. They cannot rob the people of their savings and say, `We are sorry that we are doing this'. The people will no longer accept it. The people are saying that, if the Treasurer does not resign, the Government itself must go.

         —Today we are debating a motion which has been moved by the Opposition and which criticises the Government on its handling of the economy. The motion attacks Government policy and calls for policy changes. I might say that certainly there were tight economic policies in 1988 and 1989. There were very tight monetary policies occasioned through the sale of securities, leading to increased interest rates and very tight fiscal policy when we moved away from that period of many years of Liberal Party Budget deficits to Budget surpluses where the Government was generating more revenue than it was spending.

       <para>
        Of course, we did not have economies policies tight as an end in themselves; rather, they were tight to improve Australia's economic performance, and particularly to close off a very rapid growth in imports-the spill over from too much spending and too little production into imported products. The interest rate weapon was basically the mechanism needed and put into operation to reduce the flow of imports so that we could fund imports from our trading partners by our export proceeds. We had to slow down economic growth to stop longer term growth in imported products which could not be funded by our export proceeds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the motion that has been moved today, there have been substantial policy changes taken by the Government over the past 12 months. This motion, it would seem, calls for changes in Government policy on the economy but, as Senator McMullan did, I might point out that since January last year there have been steady, sustained reductions in interest rates. My research shows that, in terms of official cash interest rates-the inter-bank rates-there have been five rounds of reductions since February last year. Twelve months ago the inter-bank interest rate was 18 per cent. At the end of 1990 it was not 18 per cent but 13 per cent. So there had been a 5 percentage point cut in that important economic indicator.
       </para>
       <para>
        That reduction helped to bring down the value of the Australian dollar compared with the currencies of our trading partners. Last year the Australian dollar had been trading at about US82c. That had the impact of making imports cheaper for this country. It had the effect of making our exports more expensive and less competitive. As a result of that movement down in interest rates and also the direct intervention of the Australian Government, through the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), they were able to talk down the Australian dollar from within the US80c range to within the mid-US70c range. That certainly has helped the competitive position of a number of Australian businesses involved in the production of traded goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since then we have had the introduction of a new round of wages policies known, in shorthand, as accord mark 6. That came into effect on 1 January. There were significant personal income tax reductions through that accord. The strategy of the Government has been to keep down the growth of wages costs for employers by granting increases in disposable income through increased take home pay-after tax pay. That has been a more effective way of remunerating Australian employees than having trade unions and other organisations demand large gross wage rises and those costs being past onto employers. The mechanism used here has been to reduce the wages pressure on businesses by the Government topping up wages through the agency of personal income tax cuts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very briefly I shall turn to some of the current economic indicators because they really expose the shallowness of this motion this afternoon, this motion that is calling for changes in policy and so forth. The reality is that in the past six months for which we have balance of payments figures-that is, the last six months of 1990-compared to the same period in 1989, the deficit on the balance of payments current account has fallen from $11.9 billion in 1989 to $8.6 billion. That is a significant improvement: a 28 per cent reduction in the current account deficit in that six-month period in 1990. Basically, that is the reason that the community has been making the sacrifices it has. That has been the reason that we have had high interest rates, that we have had a very tight fiscal policy-in order to get down the deficit on the current account in the balance of payments. I point out for Opposition members that the $8.6 billion deficit in the first half of the 1990-91 calendar year is very much on target when one looks at the Budget forecast of a deficit of $8 billion for this financial year. The figure that we have already is very well within the Budget forecast.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to say that trade surpluses, that is, surpluses on merchandise trade, are now starting to emerge in the current account. Interest rates on securities are offered by banks with which they raise funds for further lending. For example, at the beginning of last year the interest rate on 90-day bank bills was 18.5 per cent; at the end of the year it had fallen to 12.4 per cent-a reduction of over 6 percentage points in that important interest rate. We have also had a sustained reduction in the rate of inflation. We certainly cannot use the methodology that Senator Walters used this afternoon. It used to be the province of Sir Billy Snedden and Sir Phillip Lynch, whose analysis for the economy was very much in terms of taking one quarter's consumer price index and multiplying it by four. I think that is how Senator Walters got her claim today of the 10.8 per cent inflation rate in this country. That particular process is not legitimate and was exposed as such many years ago. I think that is how Senator Walters got that figure; I cannot work it out otherwise.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to note that while this motion calls for changes in economic policies, monetary policy was relaxed significantly during 1990, fiscal policy has been relaxed significantly, and there has been a new wages policy and a new tax policy given effect through the sixth version of the Accord. So there have been very profound changes in the policy settings of the macro-economic variables already. I think the important thing to bear in mind is that most of these variables have long lead times following them.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot say on a particular day that we will change an economic variable and therefore tomorrow the effect will be felt in the Australian economy. It does not work like that. We are facing very long lead times and we always have. For a number of economic variables, such as interest rates, the effect of a reduction may not be felt in the real level of production or investment for many months after the actual change has occurred. The Government is saying that it has put into place a number of policy changes already and basically we are now in the interval in which those policies begin to work.
       </para>
       <para>
        We simply cannot say that because a policy was changed very recently the effect will be felt immediately. It will not and it is very important for the Opposition to be patient and not to call for immediate indications that policies are changing when some of the parameters have been altered only very recently.
       </para>
       <para>
        As well as the policy changes I have outlined, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will be making a statement on 12 March to Parliament and it will be a major statement looking at a number of major economic policy measures. In May the Government will be awarding a $12 wage rise to Australian employees under the Accord. While the Opposition has moved this motion today, talking about hardship, it opposes this particular wage rise. Certainly, I would be interested to find out whether that is the position today, but my understanding is that when that package of tax cuts and wages was announced late last year the Opposition was opposed to the $12 wage rise. So let us get that on the record if it is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have pointed to some very fundamental improvements that have been put in place in terms of the policy settings for the Australian economy. Some very positive trends are now occurring in the economy, but we have to ensure that we do not listen to those people who are trying to talk the economy down and there are plenty of those. We certainly must not listen to the doom and gloom merchants opposite and in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser on 6 November last with the headline-this is an interesting headline because we can actually catch people out when they make categorical comments- `Business tips 10 per cent jobless by Christmas'. The South Australian Employers Federation was quoted explicitly as saying that there would be a 10 per cent unemployment rate before Christmas.

I found some in 1982 and 1983, when Mr Fraser was the Prime Minister, but I could not find any double digit unemployment figures in Australia before Christmas last year. All of those figures are on the public record now.

        Let us turn to the Liberals. What would they do? They have moved this motion today calling on us to change policy settings. What would the Liberals do if they ever got into power? Its track record shows that in 1982 it throttled the economy. It strangled the economy, it drove it into the ground and we saw double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. That is the great double that the Liberals bequeathed to the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose we could look at how the Liberal Party policies would work in effect by looking at the performance of the Tories in the United Kingdom. After all, the Liberals have worshipped on the knees Mrs Thatcher and her acolytes in the form of Mr Major. If we want to see what Liberal policies would be in practice, all we have to do is look at the United Kingdom and its record of 9.9 per cent inflation. The Australian inflation rate is nowhere near 9.9 per cent. It has a massive balance of payments problem, a massive current account problem and soaring interest rates. During last year interest rates in the United Kingdom doubled. In Australia, interest rates last year came down by five or six percentage points. They did not double as they did in the United Kingdom.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have Dr Hewson saying that he is going to solve Australia's economic problems by cutting government spending. Then we find that the Liberals are a bunch of hypocrites, they are all totally inconsistent. We bring in legislation to tighten up the assets test on family allowances and they vote against it. There is a classic case of where we were trying to cut Government spending and they all voted against it. Then we said we would look at ways and means of disposing of the gas pipeline from Moomba in South Australia to Sydney. It was a good way of boosting the funds available to the Government and these people voted against it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The biggest one of the lot is the consumption tax. These are the people who are going to, as they say, restore the fortunes of the Australian economy by bringing in a consumption tax. They are dressing up self-interest as an economic virtue. That is what it is all about-big tax cuts for the wealthy, no doubt. Let us have a look at it. They say we have got to have a consumption tax because it will help fix the current account deficit. The United Kingdom has got both. It has got the great double-a broad-based consumption tax and a massive balance of payments deficit. There we are-these silly ideas that the Liberal Party puts around, these panaceas about fixing the economy in one fell swoop.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us have a look at the consumption tax because it is evident that a consumption tax would have definite effects. It would make some products more expensive and cheapen others. That is the reality. That is what would happen if the Liberals ever got into power. At the present time, luxury cars, for example, are taxed at a 50 per cent sales tax rate in this country. Under the Liberal Party's consumption tax, by abolishing that tax, and Dr Hewson made it quite clear at the Sydney motor show in November that he would abolish that luxury car tax, luxury limousines would be taxed at 15 to 18 per cent. That is the reality, so luxury cars would come down in price under these people.
       </para>
       <para>
        My calculations show that a vehicle currently retailing for $97,000 would be reduced in price by a massive $20,000 to $77,000 under these people. These are the people who want a Rolls-Royce led recovery in Australia. These are the limousine Liberals who are totally out of touch with the ordinary people of this country. They want to put up the price of bread, fruit and vegetables, meat, clothing, children's shoes and they want to make luxury cars, diamonds, jewellery, furs, cosmetics, gold watches and other luxury goods cheaper in this country. That is what they are up to. That is how they claim they will solve the economy's problems.

         —In reply-I think I have got two minutes just to sum up. I welcome the debate that has taken place, and particularly the support that we are going to get from the Australian Democrats. This debate has exposed quite dramatically the hypocrisy of the Government's statements over a lengthy period of time now in terms of the state of the economy and the management of the economy. We have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other Ministers-but those two in particular-continue to dissemble on the real state of the economy. It is about time that the Government came clean with the Australian public on the extent of the deterioration that has occurred in the economy and on the extent of the deterioration in the budgetary position, which is a quite dramatic deterioration and which is going to lead this year to a call by the Government and the public sector on the savings of this nation.

        We have a desperately serious situation. We are hearing, as we have heard, that things will get all right. It is a bit like the call that things are going to turn up. They have been going to turn up for year after year. It has been going on and on. The Government is placing a great deal of stress on the industry statement on 12 March. We are also going to watch that industry statement very carefully indeed, because that is going to provide the last possible chance for this Government-and I believe it is too late for it-to show any form of economic credibility and integrity at all.

        It is absolutely unbelievable that Government Ministers can come into this chamber today and say to the Australian people, `Be patient, all the pain and the suffering will pay off. It will all be revealed'. These people have been in Government for eight years. They have been ruining the country for eight years. They have been telling us for eight years that things are going to get better. We have, on this side of politics, the policies to restore growth and employment. If we see, in the industry statement on 12 March, policies which adopt a responsible approach to: fiscal management; tax reform; wages policy which enables employers and employees to negotiate freely and flexibly their terms and conditions of employment; a full-blooded and open process of privatisation of the Government business enterprises of this country; and tackling micro-economic reform in a meaningful way, we will believe it.

        —Mr Deputy President, I wish to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a series of answers given by Senator McMullan to questions by Senator Watson.

       RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE PRESENTED BY SENATOR WATSON TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE AFFAIRS ON 13 DECEMBER 1990

       CLAUSE 9-PROPOSED SECTION 47a
      </para>
      <para>
       Deemed dividends and foreign tax credits
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has queried the denial of foreign tax credits or exemptions if deemed dividends are not disclosed in a tax return, even though the credits and exemptions will be allowed if the deemed dividends are disclosed.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should first be noted that proposed section 47a is an anti-avoidance provision that treats certain non-arm's length transactions of a CFC as equivalent to the payment of dividends. The types of transactions are clearly spelt out in the legislation. Whether a particular transaction is on arm's length terms is determined objectively on the facts relating to the transaction, not by the reference to any discretionary power. Thus, at the time of making the return, the taxpayer will be aware of the circumstances relating to these transactions.
      </para>
      <para>
       In cases where taxpayers are uncertain whether the section applies they have an opportunity, when lodging tax returns, to disclose transactions and seek a ruling from the Commissioner. Moreover, taxpayers have rights of objection and appeal against a decision to treat a transaction as a dividend.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where the payment by a CFC of a deemed dividend is not disclosed by the taxpayer, subsequent actual dividends paid may be taken to have qualified for exemptions and credits for which they would not qualify had the deemed dividend been taken into account. If the deemed dividend is discovered on audit-perhaps a number of years after the event-it would be difficult to recalculate previous assessments to match the relevant dividends with the appropriate credits. Given the anti-avoidance nature of the provision, the Government considers that the denial of exemptions and credits for deemed dividends that are not disclosed is, in general, appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, to cover the rare cases where taxpayers need more time to establish the facts, the Government recognises that it is appropriate to allow a reasonable period after the lodgment of a tax return for disclosure of the receipt of a deemed dividend. An amendment contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment (No. 6) Bill 1990 will allow foreign tax credits and exemptions provided the recipient of the deemed dividend discloses its receipt within one year of the end of the relevant year of income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Calculation of the profits of a CFC out of which deemed dividends could be paid
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has requested clarification on the manner in which ``profits'' must be calculated in applying proposed section 47a. I have assumed that the reference in the Senator's question to the subsection 47a (10) was intended to be a reference to proposed subsection 47a (15).
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed subsection 47a (15) provides that, in determining whether a company has profits at a particular time, it is to be assumed that the accounts of the company have been drawn up immediately before that time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where the CFC has in fact drawn up accounts up to the time the disguised distribution was made, the relevant profits will be the profits as disclosed by the accounts. This is, of course, based on the assumption that the accounts have been drawn up on commercially accepted principles of accounting.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where the CFC has no accumulated profits from previous years, or exhausts those profits, it will be necessary to determine whether a profit exists at the time the benefit under consideration is provided. Where accounts were not made up at this time, it is intended that the CFC would compute its profits at that time. It is expected that the CFC will be generally aware of the level of profits and, unless the benefit provided amounted to a substantial portion of those profits, there will be no difficulty in determining that the amount is out of profits.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, if it is not clear that the amount of the benefit is out of profits, such accounts will need to be drawn up.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have already mentioned, this result is entirely preventable if the CFC does not disguise distributions of profits.
      </para>

       Potential for double taxation under proposed section 47a
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has raised several issues regarding the potential for double taxation under proposed section 47a. Before dealing with these issues in detail, I would like to make some general comments. I have said elsewhere that one of the purposes of this legislation is to prevent avoidance of tax through the use of tax havens and that another is to ensure that income is not taxed twice. The second of these objectives has led to increased complexity of the legislation- for example, the attribution account system and the various adjustments for the capital gain provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Government has not dealt with issues of double taxation that arise from section 47a. This is the intended deterrent effect of the section which is essentially an anti-avoidance provision. I stress that any double taxation that may arise consequent to the application of section 47a can be avoided by ensuring that the CFC does not make disguised distributions to its shareholders.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having said this, the double taxation is not as widespread as is made out. I will now deal with the specific issues raised by Senator Watson.
      </para>
      <para>
       Potential for double taxation where actual dividend is paid after deemed dividends
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has raised the possibility of double taxation where a deemed dividend is taken to have been paid by a company and an actual dividend is paid subsequently by that company.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where a CFC has distributed a part of its profits as a disguised dividend and the amount has been deemed to be a dividend, that amount would not normally again be distributed. It is gone. If a dividend were subsequently paid, it would generally, in fact, be a distribution of other profits and rightly taxed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although double taxation could occur in certain circumstances, this result could be avoided by ensuring that the CFC does not make disguised distributions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Possibility of double taxation by inclusion of deemed dividend and attribution of company profits
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson states that double taxation could arise in cases where a deemed dividend paid by the CFC is included in the assessable income of taxpayer and the CFC's income (including the profit out of which the deemed dividend is paid) is also attributed to the taxpayer.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where a CFC resident in an unlisted country derives a profit, the profit may be attributed to the Australian residents with an interest in the CFC. If the CFC makes those profits available to the Australian residents otherwise than by the payment of a dividend the amount may be deemed to be a dividend. If the profits that would otherwise be attributed are distributed in that same year, the attributable income will be reduced by the amount of the deemed dividend. If instead the deemed dividend occurs after the year for which attribution occurs, the dividend will be exempt to the extent of that previous attribution. Therefore, double taxation will not arise in this case.
      </para>
      <para>
       Possibility of double taxation for ``down-stream'' dividends
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senator has also suggested double taxation could arise in relation to down-stream deemed dividends where the recipient pays a dividend back to its parent.
      </para>
      <para>
       Double taxation would not usually arise in such cases. Where a parent company resident in an unlisted country provides a benefit to its subsidiary resident in a listed country, the amount may be deemed to be a dividend. That amount may then be attributed to the residents of Australia with an interest in the listed country CFC receiving the deemed dividend. If the CFC in the listed country were then to pay the amount back to its parent as a genuine dividend, the amount would be exempt being a non-portfolio dividend received from a company resident in a listed country. Further, if the dividend flowed through to the Australian corporate shareholders, the amount would be exempt. Therefore, no double taxation would arise in such cases.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, double taxation could arise in some rare cases-for example, if the dividend eventually flowed through to a resident individual who is a shareholder in a foreign company-double taxation may arise. As previously stated, this result can be avoided by ensuring that the CFC does not attempt to disguise distributions of profits.

       The definition of ``distribution payment''
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has sought clarification for certain drafting issues in relation to the definition of the term ``distribution payment''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The term ``distribution payment'' does not require separate definition as it is specifically referred to in each of the subsections that deals with a particular category of benefits provided by one entity to another.
      </para>

       CLAUSE 18-PROPOSED TRANSFEROR TRUST MEASURES
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 102aab-Discretionary trust estates
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed paragraph (c) of the definition of a ``discretionary trust estate'' treats a trust as a discretionary trust estate where one of the beneficiaries is itself a discretionary trust estate. The Senator has stated that Australian residents who are direct beneficiaries in a non-discretionary trust may be unaware of the beneficial interest held by a discretionary trust and would therefore be unable to comply with the transferor tax measures.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government does not accept Senator Watson's proposition. The inclusion of paragraph (c) is a necessary anti-avoidance mechanism. It will prevent the foreign source income measures being avoided by interposing a non-discretionary trust estate between the taxpayer and the discretionary trust.
      </para>
      <para>
       Beneficiaries of a private non-discretionary trust who were also transferors in respect of that trust could be expected to know who the other beneficiaries are-usually family members or entities controlled by them. Moreover, transfers at market value to purchase units in, for example, a public unit trust will be exempted from the transferor tax measures. Hence, the average investor in units of a public unit trust would be outside the scope of the transferor tax measures.
      </para>
      <para>
       In this context, the Government considers it preferable to retain the definition of a discretionary trust as presently provided in the Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 102aag-Control rule for a trust estate includes associates
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 102aag sets out the circumstances in which an entity is to be taken to control a trust estate. For this purpose, control of the trust estate by an associate of the entity is treated as control by the entity. Senator Watson has submitted that a taxpayer should not be deemed to control an associate except where the taxpayer actually controls that associate.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the approach of treating a person and a person's associates as one is an essential anti-avoidance measure. The approach taken in the Bill is an established approach in the Income Tax Assessment Act and the form of the definition of associates is broadly equivalent to that already in the Act-for example, in the thin capitalisation rules and the capital gains provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 102aan-Winding up of non-resident trust estates - tax rebates
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson proposes that the law should be amended to provide that the anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act would not apply where a taxpayer winds up a non-resident trust to obtain the concessional rate of tax of 10 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       The same matter that the Senator raises in this question was dealt with in the Committee in response to a question from Senator Spindler and I refer him to the comments made there.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 102aazg-Record keeping for trust transferors
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson suggests that, notwithstanding the intention expressed in the explanatory memorandum, taxpayers who are in partnership may destroy records after five years, whereas individuals or corporations may not (except to the extent that they are in partnership with other persons).
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 102aazg specifically provides that a person who is an attributable taxpayer in relation to a particular trust estate must keep records containing particulars of and the basis of calculation of the amounts included in the assessable income of person under proposed section 102aazd in relation to that trust estate. Such a person may not otherwise have been required to keep records.
      </para>
      <para>
       While subsection 262a (1) to (3) require only a person who is carrying on a business to keep records, subsections (4) and (5) of that section have a general application and apply to a person who has possession of any records kept or obtained under or for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Those subsections will therefore apply for the purposes of proposed section 102aazg.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is necessary to specifically apply subsections 262a (4) and (5) to partnerships because, other than for the purposes of the accruals tax measures, a partnership is not a person.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subsection 102aazg extends the record keeping requirements to a partnership as if the partnership were a person.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consequently, there is a requirement for a person subject to the provisions of 102aazd to keep records for five years, which is entirely consistent with the existing requirements of the Assessment Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senator also noted that proposed subsection 102aazg (4) sets out the circumstances in which there is no obligation to keep records. He suggests that that subsection is deficient in that a taxpayer is not relieved of the obligation to keep records where information is lost, destroyed or not kept et cetera, through no fault of the taxpayer.
      </para>
      <para>
       The statutory defences provided in 102aazg are quite broad. They will enable a record keeper who has made reasonable effort to comply to avoid prosecution. The statutory defences proposed by the Senator would enable those who had not acted reasonably in relation to their record keeping obligations to hide behind the actions of others, who will often be associates of the record keeper. Accordingly, the Government does not accept the Senator's proposal.

       Proposed section 317-Designated Concession Income
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson states that it ``remains to be seen what will be made'' of the following words in draft regulation CCC:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``Form of tax benefit''; and
      </para>
      <para>
       ``Particular tax concession''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matters raised by the Senator will be taken into account in the preparation of the final regulations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 324-``subject to tax''
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has raised the matter of carry forward losses in relation to the ``subject to tax'' test.
      </para>
      <para>
       Carry forward losses may be taken into account in determining whether income or profits are subject to tax. Thus, the subject to tax test may be satisfied notwithstanding that prior years' losses, and normal expenses incurred in gaining income or profits, have the effect that no tax is required to be paid in a particular accounting period.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted that the requirement that ``foreign tax is payable'', as comprehended by proposed section 324, is not to be read as a requirement that ``foreign tax must be actually paid''. This matter is discussed in the explanatory memorandum.
      </para>
      <para>
       In view of the foregoing, it is not necessary to prescribe regulations to cater for carry forward losses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 433-Tainted Income Ratio
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has suggested that the denominator of the tainted income ratio for listed country CFCs be altered to read ``gross income''- that is, the same denominator as for the tainted income ratio applying to CFCs resident in unlisted countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to a listed country, certain income or profits are potentially subject to attribution only if they are eligible designated concession income and the CFC fails the active income test. Thus, each of the tainted income ratios is consistent in that the tainted component, which is potentially subject to attribution, is compared with the gross component to which the tainted component relates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, the law provides an exemption where the CFC is a resident of a listed country and the total amount of eligible designated concession income and income or profits from sources outside the listed country which are not subject to tax in a listed country does not exceed the lesser of $50,000 or five per cent of the gross income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 319-Statutory account period of a company-adoption of a substituted period
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson suggests that it is appropriate to allow a company to adopt another accounting period other than that period in which it must report to shareholders.
      </para>
      <para>
       The intent of proposed section 319 is to ensure that foreign companies have a 12 month accounting period for accruals purposes. Given that some CFCs do not have accounting periods or regular reporting periods it was reasonable to statutorily impose a 1 July to 30 June accounting period unless a foreign company regularly used another period. Subsection (3) enables a foreign company to elect an accounting period other than one ending 30 June if certain criteria are met. These criteria restrict adoption of a particular statutory accounting period to the accounting requirements of the company. To allow for the adoption of any accounting period for any, or no particular, reason would encourage tax deferral in certain circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 322-Meaning of ``entitled to acquire''
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has suggested that the meaning of ``entitled to acquire'' be modified. This matter is currently under consideration by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 340-Whether the control test should be more than 50% or 50% or more
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senator has suggested that the threshold test for control purposes be altered to read ``more than 50%'' in lieu of ``not less than 50%''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has adopted this approach in order to subject joint venturers to the control rule-that is, two parties not necessarily residents of the same country with equal interests in a non-resident company. Given the avoidance possibilities, and consistent with the de facto control test, the Government is of the view that it is appropriate to define control in terms of holding an interest of 50% or more in a non-resident company.
      </para>
      <para>
       New Zealand has also adopted this approach.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 384-Additional assumptions for unlisted country CFC
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has suggested that there is a need for clarification of the continued operation of Division 13 and sections 384.
      </para>
      <para>
       As background, the attributable income of a CFC is calculated as the amount that would have been the taxable income on the assumption, amongst other things, that the CFC were a resident of Australia. In calculating this notional taxable income Division 13 of the Act, the general anti-avoidance provision that prevents the shifting of profits by transfer pricing, may be applied. It is further assumed that the attributable income is calculated on the basis that the CFC had only certain ``income or other amounts''-broadly, tainted income and certain trust income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has raised two drafting matters. First, he submitted that a notional amount calculated under Division 13 cannot be said to fall within the expression ``income or other amounts'', although it is recognised that this is the intention of the legislation as evidenced by the explanatory memorandum. This matter was raised in the course of preparing the legislation and it is my advice that the legislation operates as intended. Secondly, the Senator submits that a notional amount cannot be categorised as tainted income, since this definition is phrased in terms of actual amounts and not notional amounts. Again, my advice is that, given the purpose of the section, this is incorrect.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senator further submits, as a matter of policy, that the application of Division 13 is not warranted in certain circumstances. Specifically, it is suggested that application of Division 13 be modified for the calculation of the attributable income to ensure that it applies only to non-arm's length loans made after the commencement of the CFC measures. The rationale for the suggested grandfathering is that the arrangements could not have been entered for the purpose of avoiding Australian tax and that CFCs cannot readily rearrange the loans to prevent the application of Division 13.
      </para>
      <para>
       The difficulty of CFCs rearranging their inter-company loans to ensure that the operation of Division 13 is not triggered appears to be overstated. Discussions with practitioners as a result of inquiries directed to the Tax Office indicate that significant restructuring of inter-company loans is now occurring. Further, the reasoning advanced could equally be applied to every investment or activity undertaken, or to any structure set-up, prior to the commencement of the CFC measures, unless there was a clear indication of a tax avoidance motive. Provision of grandfathering on this basis alone would lead to a significant weakening of the measures and would allow taxpayers currently engaged in minimisation of tax through CFCs to continue to do so indefinitely. Therefore, any provision of grandfathering in this context would require evidence of real inequity rather than difficulty or inconvenience.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the general operation of Division 13 in the calculation of attributable income will be subject to an on-going review to ensure that it will not operate in inappropriate circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       The attributable income of a CFC resident in an unlisted country is to be calculated under the further assumption that the only income or other amounts derived by the CFC are those amounts that fall within certain categories-that is, tainted income, trust income and certain partnership income. The Senator seems to be suggesting that an amount may fall within more than one category. This is correct. However, the conclusion that double counting can therefore occur is not accepted. The assumption is structured so that the quantification of the amount is separate from the identification of the amounts that may be taken into account. Therefore, although an amount may fall within more than one category, it results in only one amount being included in the calculation of the attributable income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 385-Additional assumptions for calculating the attributable income of a CFC in a listed country
      </para>
      <para>
       The issues raised by Senator Watson in respect of the calculation of the attributable income of a CFC resident in a listed country are predominantly the same as those raised for the calculation for a CFC resident in an unlisted country and the same comments apply. The only additional issue raised is that section 385 should have certain words inserted. This was a matter that arose after the release of the draft Bill in June and was addressed prior to the introduction of the Bill into the Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 387-Reduction of attributable income because of interim dividends
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has raised certain issues in relation to the operation of this section. By way of background, a CFC may pay a dividend out of its current year's profits. Where this occurs, in the absence of any relief, the dividend may be taxed as well as the underlying profits from which it is paid being included in attributable income. This double taxation is prevented by the reduction of the attributable income of a CFC by the amount of a dividend that can reasonably be said to relate to the profits that would otherwise be included in attributable income. Senator Watson suggests that the operation of the provision should be clarified.
      </para>
      <para>
       First, Senator Watson submits that, where a dividend is paid part way through the year of income, it is not clear whether an amount can be said to relate to attributable income derived after that date, or whether the dividend must relate to an amount already derived by the CFC. Problems only arise if the former view is taken. My advice is that, in this context, an amount can reasonably be said to relate to attributable income whether or not the attributable income has yet be derived.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted that the reduction will be taken to relate to amounts derived in the current year only where all previous years' profits have been distributed-that is, profits are taken to have been distributed yearly on a first-in-first-out basis. This is clearly stated in the Explanatory Memorandum. The Government does not agree with Senator Watson's suggestion that the taxpayer will have difficulty in determining whether or not all of the previous year's profits of the CFC have been distributed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consequently, the Government sees no reason for further legislative clarification of the provision at this stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 388-Interaction with double tax agreements
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has suggested that proposed section 388 effectively nullifies parts of Australia's international agreements.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is neither the Government's intention, nor is it the effect of section 388, to override any provision of any international agreement. Section 388 is only relevant for the purposes of calculating the attributable income of a CFC for the purposes of proposed division 7 of Part X of the Act. This is not a matter to which the double tax treaties apply.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 394-Eligible finance share dividends
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has provided suggestions in relation to the scope and operation of this section. His comments will be taken into account in the context of the review of this section, announced in the Treasurer's Press Release of 29 June 1990.

      <para>
       Proposed section 398-Modified application of depreciation provisions
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has raised certain issues in relation to the modifications made to the depreciation provisions as they apply for the calculation of the attributable income of a CFC.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the depreciation provisions of the Act, depreciation of plant and equipment used in the production of assessable income is allowed as a deduction. Where the amount allowed as a deduction is later recouped by the taxpayer on the sale of the plant or equipment, the amount recouped is included in the taxpayer's assessable income. In the calculation of the attributable income of a CFC, the Commissioner is given a discretion to, amongst other things, determine the recouped amount to be included in attributable income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson suggests that the Commissioner's discretion is unfettered and could result in a recoupment greater than the amount actually claimed as a deduction. Accordingly, it is suggested that the discretion should be modified to ensure that the recouped amount is limited to the amount that has been allowed as a deduction or used in the calculation of a carry forward loss.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is my advice that the provision could not reasonably be applied in this manner. The Commissioner's discretion is not unfettered as he is under a duty to apply the law in accordance with its clear purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
       The operation of the depreciation provision was reviewed, in accordance with the undertaking of the Treasurer in the press release of 29 June 1990 and it was decided no amendment was warranted at this stage. However, it is expected that the matter will be reviewed in the context of the self assessment review of Commissioner's discretions that has been announced by the Treasurer.

       Proposed section 421-Elections under CGT roll-over provisions
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson has raised issues concerning the time period for elections under the roll-over provisions of Part IIIA of the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       By way of background, under Part IIIA (Capital Gains and Losses) of the Act, certain asset disposals are ignored in determining the gain or loss that arises during a taxpayer's year of income. In general, the gain or loss is effectively deferred until the later disposal of the replacement asset by the taxpayer, or until the later disposal of the asset by another taxpayer. These provisions, commonly called roll-over provisions, are also applicable in the calculation of the attributable income of a CFC. As is the case under the Part IIIA, the roll-over provision may operate either automatically or at the election of the taxpayer or the taxpayers involved. Where Part IIIA requires that one or more taxpayers elect that a roll-over provision should apply, the election is modified for the purpose of calculating the attributable income of a CFC. In such cases, the election must be made by the CFC within two months of the end of the CFC's statutory accounting period, or within such time as the Commissioner allows.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson submits that, notwithstanding the Commissioner's discretion to extend the basic two month period, a longer basic period should be provided. He supports this view by reference to the existing period which allows time until the lodgment of the taxpayer's return of income.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the normal operation of Part IIIA is not directly analogous. Under Part IIIA, the period to the lodgment of the taxpayer's return is allowed because it is convenient for the taxpayer and the ATO, and not because it is considered the minimum sufficient time. This is not possible for the calculation of the attributable income of a CFC since there may be several attributable taxpayers involved, each of which may have a different income year. Since the election to apply the roll-over provision must be common for all of these attributable taxpayers, a single date must be fixed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Two months from the end of the statutory accounting period of the CFC is considered a reasonable time period as it is anticipated that, in the majority of disposals for which roll-over relief will be available, taxpayers will be aware of the implications of asset disposals through CFC's for which roll-over relief is to be available and would have taken the tax consequences into consideration before the disposal is made. However, it is recognised that certain roll-overs will be available for unanticipated or uncontrollable disposals. Further, circumstances which cannot be foreseen may require a longer period. Consequently, the Commissioner is to be given the power to extend the period if such extension is reasonable in the circumstances. If, in practice, it becomes apparent that the initial period is not sufficient in the majority of cases, an amendment to extend the period will be considered.

       Proposed section 432-Active income test-company in the first year of operation
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson submits that a company in the first year of operation may not pass the active income test and that this has unfair consequences.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where a company fails the active income test, generally only its tainted income is included in the attributable income on which resident taxpayers may be called upon to pay Australian tax. In most cases, the tainted income would be interest income from the deposit of surplus funds pending utilisation of those funds for active business operations. The Government sees no justification for the provision of a different tax treatment for this income compared with tainted income derived by an established company.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 432 (read with sections 332 and 333)-Active income test-different countries of incorporation and activity
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson submits that it is unfair that a company cannot satisfy the active income test because it is incorporated in one country but carries on business in another country.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government does not agree with Senator Watson's assertion that the provision is ``unfair''. It is a deliberate anti-avoidance policy feature of the active income test that a ``letterbox'' company incorporated in one country but not carrying on business in that country cannot obtain the benefit of the active income test.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, it should be remembered that failing the active income test will generally only cause the CFC's tainted income to be attributed to those residents who hold the requisite interests in the CFC.

      <para>
       Section 432-Active income test-qualified accounts

      <para>
       A CFC generally will not pass the active income test if its accounts are qualified by the auditors for any reason.
      </para>
      <para>
       A necessary anti-avoidance requirement is that the company's accounts give a true and fair view of its financial position and profits. It is not proposed to provide any exception for qualified accounts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 438-Active income test-Roll-overs-asset disposals
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson points out that the roll-over provisions for the active income test and the calculation of attributable income are not analogous.
      </para>
      <para>
       As background, in determining whether or not a CFC has passed the active income test, roll-over relief is also to be taken into account so that certain asset disposals are ignored. The roll-over relief is intended to be analogous to that provided for the calculation of the attributable income of a CFC.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senator's observations are correct in that the roll-overs are not analogous. However, it is anticipated that the majority of disposals for which roll-over relief will be necessary will be for transfers between wholly owned group companies. This relief has been provided. Amendment to the extend roll-over relief for other disposals on the same basis as for the calculation of attributable income will be considered before the first calculation of attributable income is required. Since these roll-over provisions are largely for disposals which are beyond the control of the taxpayer, it is anticipated that taxpayers' actions will not be restricted by the absence of the provisions at this stage.

       Section 447-Tainted sales income-goods substantially altered by agents or subcontractors should be excluded
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Watson submits that where goods are substantially altered by a subcontractor or agent, for or on behalf of a CFC, then income from the sale of such goods should be excluded from the tainted sales income of the CFC.
      </para>
      <para>
       The exemption provided in section 447 for a CFC that carries on a manufacturing operation is meant to apply to a CFC that itself engages in manufacture. This represents genuine business operations of the CFC. It is not meant to cover agency or subcontracting arrangements.

       Section 459-Assessability in respect of certain dividends deemed to be paid by a CFC under section 47a (of the Principal Act)
      </para>
      <para>
       In brief it is asserted that where a deemed dividend is included in a taxpayer's assessable income under proposed section 459 no relief mechanism is provided in the Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 47a is an anti-avoidance provision, designed to deal with taxpayers who enter into transactions that would enable an unlisted country CFC to make its profits available for the use of associated Australian or listed country companies without distributing the profits as dividends. Section 47a will deem these transactions as the payment of dividends.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 459 deals with deemed dividends other than those paid to shareholders. Accordingly, in view of the abnormal nature of these payments, credit and exemptions are not available for these dividends.

      </para>

       This requirement would cause an additional and significant compliance burden on some taxpayers and, given the existing information gathering powers of the Commissioner the proposed section 264a, the Government does not consider that such action is warranted.

       Clause 60 and 65-Transitional Regulations and Tax Administration Act
      </para>
      <para>
       Before discussing the technical matters that were raised under these clauses, I would like to respond to the comments concerning the relationship between the Australian Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department. The Australian taxation office has asked me to assure Senator Watson and other members of the Committee that it has a good working relationship with the Attorney General's Department. Also, the departmental officers actually involved in the drafting of the foreign income regulations have asked me to convey to the Committee that there is absolutely no foundation in the rumour that the relationship between them is ``not all that it should be''. The drafting of the regulations is being given priority by the Office of Legislative Drafting and, given the complexity of the task, I am satisfied with its progress.
      </para>
      <para>
       The comments made in respect of the construction of the regulations have been noted. They will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the final regulations.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to take this opportunity to make some general comments on the regulations. The retrospective operation of the regulations is required from the start of the 1990/91 income year to accord tax exempt treatment for non-portfolio dividends and overseas branch profits derived by Australian companies from listed countries. In view of the fact that the proposed tax exemption also applies to substituted accounting periods for the 1990/91 year of income, it is necessary for the regulations to specify the listed countries as from 1 July 1989-that is, for early balancing companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also, with regard to provisions which enable controlled foreign companies to deduct prior year losses in calculating their attributable income, the regulations need to be able to apply to losses incurred as early as 1 July 1983. Of course, this early commencement favours the taxpayer.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, while the retrospective operation of the regulations will give taxpayers access to various concessional measures from the earliest date, it is also necessary that transitional anti-avoidance provisions operate effectively from the same time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Extensive public consultation on the draft Bill alerted taxpayers to the listed country exemptions. In the absence of effective anti-avoidance provisions it would be quite easy, prior to the start of the 1990/91 income year, for taxpayers to transfer accumulated income from tax havens to companies in listed countries. The income could then be distributed to Australian corporate shareholders free of Australian company tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the regulations did not have retrospective effect, there would be no listed countries until the regulations come into operation. Further, as only income from listed countries benefits from the exemptions provided, taxpayers would be disadvantaged if the operation of the package of the regulations and transitional anti-avoidance measures was prospective only.

       Current practice is not to pay interest on vostro balances in credit, so they are not included in foreign debt.

       Given the problems with the economy and the difficulties some companies are facing in paying their tax obligation due on 17/12 how immutable is this 28/7 date for companies balancing on 30th June 1991 or 28 days after the end of the accounting period?

      </para>
      <para>
       Question 1. Vostro accounts
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the Bill was debated there have been negotiations with the financial industry on this matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       The thin capitalisation definition of foreign debt in relation to a company has two main elements. Firstly, an amount is owing to a foreign controller or non-resident associate of the foreign controller and secondly interest is payable on this amount.
      </para>
      <para>
       As you stated in your question, the current industry practice is not to pay interest on vostro account surplus balances. Therefore vostro account surplus balances do not satisfy the second element of foreign debt and are consequently beyond the scope of the thin capitalisation rules. For this reason it was unnecessary to provide an express exemption from the definition of foreign debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted that the amendments were drafted to reflect the industry practice. The overall objective being to enable taxpayers to comply with the thin capitalisation rules without undue disruption to their normal business activities. If however, industry practice changes and interest is paid on vostro accounts, the Government will review the matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       Question 2. Resident holding companies
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed section 159GZLA only applies to a small number of banks and the industry association concerned was consulted. The Reserve Bank was also consulted to ensure the provision conformed with banking industry regulations. The Government has been advised of the concerns of certain banks with this provision and the issue is currently being reviewed.
      </para>
      <para>
       This provision allows a resident holding company to owe interest free debt to a foreign controller or a non-resident associate of the foreign controller. However, this amount must be subtracted from its notional foreign equity in the resident bank. Therefore the provision in effect, excludes such interest free debt from the thin capitalisation controls.
      </para>
      <para>
       Question 3. Nostro and Vostro Accounts
      </para>
      <para>
       1 &amp;2. In this age of electronic fund transfers, a 10 day clearance period would appear to be a sufficient time to clear such accounts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore we are not considering extending the clearance period to 30 days.
      </para>
      <para>
       3 &amp;4. An offending transaction will only result in the concession being withdrawn from that transaction. Clause 9 prescribes that nostro and vostro accounts must be maintained on the basis that deposits are cleared within 10 days and overdraft advances are repaid within 10 days. Moreover, the account must be operated for the sole purpose of settling international transactions. Provided these conditions are satisfied a nostro or vostro account will not be tainted by an inadvertent failure to clear a deposit or overdraft within 10 days.
      </para>
      <para>
       Question 4. Company Self-Assessment
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is not proposing to alter the system for paying company tax. As previously stated in the Senate by the Minister representing the Treasurer, any company which has difficulty in meeting its tax obligations should contact the Australian Taxation Office so that consideration is given whether to extend the time for payment or to allow the company to pay by instalments.
      </para>
      <para>
       Different companies may face different financial problems and the Taxation Office needs to consider each application for time to pay on a case by case basis.

       </para>
       <para>
        The matter that I wish to refer to relates to the information given on pages 42 and 43 of the report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies regarding the Institute's assessments of the coalition's family tax package and the Australian Labor Party's policies to assist families. This report is incomplete in the sense that it does not indicate the extraordinary controversies which enveloped the Institute during the last election campaign. Honourable senators will recall that the Institute of Family Studies chose to involve itself in a very political manner during the election campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, the day Mr Peacock delivered the Liberal Party's policy speech, the Institute chose to make a press release which criticised one of the key policies of the coalition-the family tax package. The Institute apparently waited four months to publish its attack on Mr Peacock and chose the day of the policy speech to get maximum coverage. More happy, however, was Mr Hawke. On the day he delivered a major statement to the press club, the Labor Party's policies were contrasted favourably with those of the coalition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make the obvious point that men and women of good faith can differ. The coalition released a very detailed rebuttal of the Institute's attack on the family tax package.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the time I have available, I do not have the opportunity to outline the many criticisms made by Dr John Hewson and Mr Connolly about the Institute's attack on the coalition policies. But, to my knowledge, these criticisms have never been adequately answered by the Institute. We would certainly welcome a detailed response from the Institute now. This is important because the Institute of Family Studies' standing was certainly damaged by its behaviour during the election period.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may like to recall just one fact. The coalition was offering some $830m a year in child-care tax rebates compared with some $87m offered by the Labor Party. In other words, the coalition was offering some 10 times more support for child-care. Yet, it was the Labor Party child-care policy which received the endorsement of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. There are some important questions which must be answered. For example, should a publicly funded organisation involve itself so prominently in an election campaign? Do the directors of the Institute, on reflection, believe its performance was appropriate? Are we to expect a similar performance during the next election?

        The coalition attacked the welfarist approach of the Institute. The Institute may well consider whether it does not need to adopt a broader philosophical perspective and to examine whether all major shades of opinion are adequately represented on its board and on its staff. In a press release of 5 March, Dr Hewson and Mr Connolly criticised Brian Howe's politicisation of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Since the election, I am pleased to say that the Institute has adopted a more constructive approach. We hope that this is not just a hiccup in the Institute's performance. May I express the hope, in conclusion, that Senator Richardson will ensure that the Institute adopts, and is seen to adopt, a role independent of government.

         —I would also like to speak very briefly on the annual report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. While browsing through the report I had a look at pages 40 and 41. As I understand it, someone on an average income is earning about $25,000 a year or perhaps a little less. The Institute has looked at the cost of children in Australia, and it says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This work is still being evaluated but one paper describing the structures of the costs of children was produced during the year, `Research on the costs of children: policy implications', by Peter McDonald.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Lee study, the full cost of one child in a one income family with an income a little above average weekly earnings was as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        and it has been updated to 1989. The extraordinary situation is that it costs $10,810 a year to support and care for a child between the ages of 11 and 13.
       </para>
       <para>
        How can the Government possibly say that living standards are adequate in the present situation when average income is $25,000 a year and it costs $10,810, nearly $11,000, to look after a teenage child? It makes one wonder how people with young children can possibly manage. How can a one-income family with three or four teenagers manage? Of course, that is quite impossible.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Government should take note of the annual report. I hope that the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, will read, mark, learn and inwardly digest those figures because he has to have a clear understanding of the poverty that is presently existing amongst children in this country.

        <para in-line="1">
         —I wish to speak very briefly to the report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS). I would like to begin by congratulating the Institute on celebrating its tenth anniversary in 1990 and for its excellent annual report which sets out a wide range of activities and projects undertaken by the Institute over the past 12 months.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Institute's research program continues to be of great value and is an ongoing source of significant, sophisticated and reliable information about the state and well-being of Australian families. The AIFS has also played an important role in encouraging public sector debate about family related issues and I can only assume that it is the Government's paranoia about any sort of vaguely controversial public debate that is one of the factors for the Institute continuing to be starved of funds. I quote from page 3 of the board's introduction to this annual report:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Institute's budget base has not been increased in real terms over the past four years . . . The Board . . . is concerned that funding restrictions are unduly confining the work of the Institute . . . Important research has had to be delayed or not tackled at all. The Institute's computer system is barely capable of meeting existing work demands, thus . . . threatening future research output. Limits have been placed on a more active dissemination program for the Institute's findings . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I find it extraordinary that work as vital as the Institute's can continue to be jeopardised. One could say, I could perhaps cynically suggest, that it is because the Government does not particularly want to have its economic and social rhetoric muddied by the facts as they appear in these research findings. But any Government should surely have the maturity and wisdom to appreciate the value of the information provided by the Institute.
       </para>
       <para>
        On this we need to be clear. This research is of crucial importance and anyone who has followed the Institute's work over the years will realise that it provides not only an invaluable source of basic information and statistics but also signals clear directions to take across all areas of public and private enterprise in the development of comprehensive policies to assist Australian families.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to look briefly at two important areas covered by the Institute. Firstly, I refer to youth incomes. The Institute's 1989 report on young people's incomes What Price Independence provides case material that queries the prevailing Government's assumptions that parents are able and willing to support their children and that young people's living costs are somehow less than adults. These assumptions have been behind cuts in social security benefits for young people and this report clearly shows these assumptions have been more rhetoric than factual. It would, I suspect, be too much to hope that the Government might actually take into account the facts in this report instead of the myths upon which it has based its attacks on young unemployed and young homeless people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, I wish to look briefly at child poverty. The Institute's work in this area has been significant and influential and I would urge all senators to read the publication on child poverty released in 1989. Perhaps the most important point the Institute has pushed in regard to child poverty has been to look beyond the economic costs and to point out the great social costs to our community which, as this report notes at page 40, means that the eradication of child poverty `cannot be seen as a ``welfare cost'' but as investments in future productivity and social well-being for the whole nation'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, this attitude is indicative of the Institute's general approach to its research. It attempts, through its various programs, to foster a preventative approach in relation to family policy; it looks beyond a number crunching mentality; and it tries to place its empirical research squarely in the context of modern Australian society. It tries to say: here are the facts and these facts show the way towards developing policies and programs that can keep families together through very difficult times but can also support members of families that are unable to stay together for whatever the reason.
       </para>
       <para>
        Difficult economic times invariably lead to increased strain on families and it becomes important that we should support a body like the Institute which has as its goal the protection of the family as the basic social unit and which directs its energies towards-as the board points out in this report on page 5-`the need for an efficacy of preventive social support for families, as compared with the higher costs and difficulties of later forms of intervention'.
       </para>
       <para>
        If more attention were paid to the work of this Institute by government, the Opposition, trade unions and business, we would be well on the way to addressing some of the community's more pressing problems. We just might have fewer kids sleeping on our streets, fewer instances of domestic violence, fewer people queuing for emergency relief from welfare agencies and fewer families in crisis. This annual report demonstrates the value of the Institute's work. It demonstrates that it deserves more than a continuing financial snub from the Government.

       It is with considerable concern that I note that this Government continues to support tobacco research in this country at a time when it is generally recognised that a great deal of the death and injury to health which occurs as a consequence of drug taking and drug addiction is related to the use of tobacco. The statistics show that some 80 per cent of drug related deaths in this country are related to the consumption of tobacco. While enormous efforts are put into the interception of other drugs, particularly the so-called hard drugs, they in fact play quite a small part in the death and injury which occurs to Australians as a consequence of the use of drugs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, it is with some interest that I note that, according to this report, the Tobacco Research Council has allocated an amount of over $1.8m to 29 research projects and administration. On page 1 of the report the Council outlines the objectives of the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 under which it operates. The first objective reads:
      </para>
      <para>
       increasing the commercial returns to industry members and to the community in general by improving the production, processing, storage, transport or marketing of tobacco leaf.
      </para>
      <para>
       Elsewhere it points out that the actual amount of tobacco leaf grown per hectare has increased quite substantially as a consequence of that intention. The other objectives are:
      </para>
      <para>
       making more effective use of the resources and skills of the community and of the scientific community in particular; and
      </para>
      <para>
       improving accountability for expenditure on research and development activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       I raise a very serious question as to the moral sense of having a research institute attempting to increase the commercial returns to industry members and the community in general by improving the production, processing, et cetera, of tobacco leaf when, quite clearly, increasing the returns to industry members by increasing the consumption of tobacco leaf has absolutely enormous disbenefits to the community in terms of the damage to health and the number of people who are actually killed as a direct consequence of that damage to health.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the second term of reference, `making more effective use of resources and skills in the community and of the scientific community', in my view that is an enormous misallocation of resources, particularly the scientific resources of the Australian scientific community, in researching tobacco production and the production of such a dangerous material. Further on, the report mentions the challenges facing the tobacco-growing industry. Under six brief paragraphs it lists a number of the challenges facing the tobacco industry, but not one of those challenges listed is to do with the growing concern in the community of the enormous health effects of the use and consumption of tobacco and tobacco products.
      </para>
      <para>
       It would seem to me that the major challenge facing the tobacco industry at present is precisely the rising concern which the community is expressing about the consumption of this material. If this partly Government-funded body does not recognise that as a challenge to the tobacco industry and take that into account, then surely this body is not fulfilling its proper public function.

       I congratulate the Cotton Research Council on its report and the work that it does in trying to increase the industry's commercial returns. I note that the Council is attempting to do this by placing heavy emphasis on crop and environment protection and improving on-farm operations and management systems. I note that 65 per cent of the project funding is directed to these activities, and it has the support of the industry itself in these objectives. I am pleased to tell honourable senators that it makes me feel happy to be able to talk about a report from a rural industry that is doing well. In these days when we constantly hear of the disaster in rural Australia-no matter what the industry; whether it is wheat, wool, sugar, meats, fruits, beans or a range of other industries-it is comforting to know that some rural people are coping reasonably well. I might add that they are doing so despite the Government, as many of the rural problems in Australia today are not the cause of international events but rather of some short-sighted and devastating policies of the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a pity that when discussing the plight of the rural industries, Government members opposite have to resort to quoting the buoyancy of the cotton industry to suggest that the rural crisis exists only in selected industries. I can tell honourable senators opposite that what they fail to appreciate is that the cotton industry is the exception and not the norm. Sometimes I wonder whether the Government has embarked on a policy of sabotaging Australia's rural industries for some unforeseen agenda of its own. However, as I said earlier, amid the rural gloom-what the crop farmers call `white gold'-cotton is shining through.
      </para>
      <para>
       In my own State of Queensland, growers are gearing up for the start of a rich cotton harvest next month buoyed by a market price surge and useful late rains. Current estimates are that the crop could produce a record 400,000 bales worth more than $150m. Currently, world prices for cotton have topped $500 a bale on news that the United States' stocks are at a record low. Only yesterday I read in our Courier-Mail of a multi-million dollar expansion of cotton ginneries at Goondiwindi, St George and Cecil Plains which are nearing completion in order to handle the expected big crop. It has also reported on the success of farmers such as Glen Fresser, who left our own South Burnett district, where he was growing peanuts, to take up cotton farming at Nandi, near Dalby. Glen has switched completely to cotton, and it appears that, unlike many others in rural industries, he is surviving and doing well. Despite all the good news, I must point out that the report states:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . volatility of export prices has and will remain a feature of the industry, making it more difficult than otherwise for growers to plan their operations.'
      </para>
      <para>
       The report notes that the industry exports over 90 per cent of the cotton it produces, with shipments being made to a wide range of countries, but mainly to those in the Asian region.
      </para>
      <para>
       In total, Australian exports amount to only some five per cent of the world trade. However, there is cause for concern. The Council states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Up until 1988, the fibre strength of Australian varieties, overall fibre quality and reliability of supply enabled the local industry to obtain a useful marketing margin over corresponding grades from other sources.
      </para>
      <para>
       . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       But since 1988, this margin has eroded and while this may have been partly due to the effects of extended rain during harvest, it is a matter of concern to local growers.
      </para>
      <para>
       We also have to recognise that while the cotton crop yield in Australia is high by world standards, the great bulk of the crop is grown intensively under irrigation and, correspondingly, costs per hectare are high. The Council also notes that the crop is also at risk from the devastating attack from insect pests necessitating substantial amounts of pesticides to be used, which is both costly and carries the risk of resistance developing in these insects. Many of our bureaucrats recognise that even if a rural industry seems to be returning reasonable or high prices for its goods, much of that money goes quickly into paying bills, as there are often very high costs associated with producing the goods.

         —I wish to address some brief remarks to the report. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the members of the Committee for concluding their investigations into the last Federal election so promptly and for presenting their unanimous report in ample time for some action to be taken. Too often these reports have become merely historic documents because the next election has been held before there was any response to the Committee's findings. Some of the findings in this report repeat recommendations made in the 1987 election inquiry. I think all honourable senators hope that the Australian Electoral Commission will take note of the report and will have procedures in place for the next election to overcome some of the problems which were apparent last March.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A number of the recommendations seem to be merely sensible management practice and should, for example, prevent the queuing which was such an unfortunate feature of the last election. When we have a purported system of compulsory voting where people face a potential $50 fine for not voting, it is incumbent on the authorities to make the procedure of casting a vote as quick and convenient as possible. It is interesting to note that the claim that this was a record turnout still means that there were nearly half a million voters on the roll who apparently did not cast a vote.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of electoral rolls, the Committee notes `sustained criticism' of their accuracy. We await with interest the results of the Electoral Commission's check survey investigating enrolments in six electorates in the lead-up to the election that was due for release late last year-and we expect an undertaking that resources will be available to correct any weaknesses identified in records and/or procedures. The Electoral Commission is moving to full-scale use of the roll management system which, allied with the current comprehensive habitation review, is designed to ensure that the rolls are as up to date and reliable as possible. It is particularly important that this task is completed shortly so that redistribution this year uses the most accurate data. I am sure that all senators and members have an interest in ensuring this and with my colleagues I shall monitor this process and review the enrolment figures and projections issued by the Australian Electoral Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the reforms recommended by the Committee are plain commonsense. For example, the straightforward step of allowing a notional preference distribution by scrutineers will mean that meaningful results are available on election night. The Committee reports that perhaps Electoral Commission procedures were not geared for the increased vote recorded by independent and third party candidates. In my view, this may well have been a one-off experience. Honourable senators might wish to recall that, in the vote for the House of Representatives Australia-wide, the coalition polled nearly 400,000 more primary votes than the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and that the Government's parliamentary majority was obtained despite the fact that Labor did not achieve a popular majority on the two-party preferred votes. Given that this outcome repeated the experience at the last State elections held in South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, I wonder how many submissions were received by the Committee from the electoral fairness and anti-gerrymander activists who have taken such a high profile in the past.

         —I thank Senator Kemp. Not one was received. The Committee made no recommendations about the system of public funding for elections and the requirements for disclosure of donations and of third party election expenditure. In relation to the latter matter, honourable senators may be disturbed to learn that the analysis of third party election expenditure at the March Federal election reveals that some Government-funded political advocacy groups spent significant sums to influence opinion during that campaign. Of course, the Liberal and National parties support to the fullest the freedom of speech and expression, including the right to promote views through paid advertising, but apparent round robins of taxpayers' money being given to lobby groups which then urge people to vote for their government patrons is a completely different matter.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, the role of the Australian Conservation Foundation is particularly noteworthy. It spent $164,581 during the election, urging people to give their higher preferences to the ALP, and after the election its Government grant was increased-at a time of fiscal restraint-to $275,264. The Joint Standing Committee previously examined the question of election advertisements and some Labor identities are calling for a broadcasting ban during election campaigns. However, they do not appear to have expressed any disquiet about the practice I have described. Many of the third party groups which advertised during the election campaign had been recipients of taxpayers' grants. While anyone is free to promote their views, it appears totally incongruous that these campaigns should be indirectly funded by the long-suffering taxpayer. Indeed, it has all the hallmarks of corruption for governments to expose themselves to this type of pressure. It might be useful for the Committee to take a further look into this matter. I commend the report to the Senate.

         —I would like to endorse the remarks of Senator Parer and in particular I welcome the attention he has drawn to the growing development in this country of taxpayers' funds being used by special lobby and interest groups for their own activities. However, at the end of the day they seem to become remarkably active during election campaigns in supporting the Government, which has often so wilfully used taxpayers' money.

        I would like to make a few brief comments on the report before the chamber. I was appointed to the Committee in the latter part of August and therefore some of the deliberations of the Committee commenced before I joined it. I would like to say that I think the Committee worked well. Even colleagues such as Senator Faulkner were at times able to bury party political views. In my view, the Committee worked comparatively constructively.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to draw a number of remarks to the attention of the Senate. One of the major concerns in the report was queuing at polling booths. A range of measures has been urged upon the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to prevent that happening again. Another item that was featured was the facilitation of the processes so that scrutineers on election night could observe the candidate-party preferred vote. This arose because of the interest in some areas that some minor parties and interest groups could alter the results significantly. The primary vote then is not a fair indicator of the results and parties want to know how the minor party preferences are flowing. These changes would give a good indication on election night about who will form the government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Happily, the recommendations of the Committee, if they are adopted, will not hold up the Senate vote count too much. Indeed, one of the recommendations refers to the importance of the Senate and requires an improved performance in the percentage of votes counted and the votes publicly announced on election night. Honourable senators will recall the inadequate performance in relation to the counting of the Senate vote last March in some areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have a number of other matters I would like to draw to the attention of the chamber. We are pleased that some notice has been taken of the constant complaints about incorrect mail addressed to constituents and the amount of return to sender mail we receive. It has been suggested in the report that the AEC take note of the mail we forward to it with a view to cleansing the rolls. Perhaps the next report the Committee brings down could even toughen this up a little further.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is good to see that there are increased penalties for deceptive how to vote cards and the like. Penalties are not much good once the material is printed, but they may be a deterrent. We will be monitoring this closely. Also, it is good to see that some effort will be given to reminding the older citizens of their obligation to vote. There is a noticeable change in voting incidence after the age of 70 years, when the percentage of non-voting persons increases considerably.
       </para>
       <para>
        One matter which was to have come before the Committee and has been referred to by Senator Parer, but which apparently faded away, was the expected supplementary submission from the Labor Party on its proposal to ban electronic advertising or whatever scheme it may have decided upon. One would assume that the Committee will meet to examine the submission when it is ready. Honourable senators will be aware that there is constant speculation in the press about Labor's new stance, and I hope that we will be able to hear its proposals soon.
       </para>
       <para>
        This was a report into the 1990 election, not an all-embracing view of things electoral. As such, we tried to resolve some difficult situations which necessarily differ from State to State and region to region. For example, polling queues are worse in the city than in the country, and worse in Sydney and Melbourne than other capitals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Liberal Party remains concerned with various other aspects of the electoral process, and one of the more important of these is redistribution. A fair redistribution can occur only with clean rolls and adequate forecasting of population predictions. We are concerned about the level of accuracy of electoral rolls and hope that the current round of habitation reviews will cleanse the rolls so that a fair basis can be obtained.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are concerned that, when the population predictions are made, they should be done from a base of sound statistics which can be verified. We also want the reasons for making such predictions to be spelled out. In other words, we want to know how the final numbers have been arrived at, and their level of accuracy. We look forward with interest to the next redistribution results and trust that the end product is fair, equitable and just.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate my support for the comments of Senator Parer, who noted that, whereas the Labor Party in election after election does not win the majority of votes, it does in fact win government. He drew attention to the fact that those who are concerned about fair elections should be concerned about this. Senator Faulkner, who is in the chamber, is undoubtedly concerned. We look forward to his support when we ensure a fairer redistribution. In conclusion, I recommend that all honourable senators read this report, which by the nature of our profession is of interest to us all.

         —I support the remarks of my Opposition colleagues Senator Parer and Senator Kemp and commend the whole of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, including Senator Kemp, for the work that is represented in the Committee's report. It is of interest to all honourable senators and it is right that we review, not only after each election but systematically, the conduct of elections in this country and the general provisions through the Australian Electoral Commission.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I made a submission to this inquiry-I think we were all invited to do so-and I am delighted to see that the Committee, in its recommendations and in the report on pages 36, 37 and 38, fully accepts the submission that I made, which was to ensure that there are resources and procedures in place to ensure that the Senate vote is substantially counted on election night and that that count is transmitted to the Australian public.
       </para>
       <para>
        To my dismay, on the night of the last election-more than any other I can remember in the last 20 years-the Senate was hardly mentioned. When the nation's attention was placed on the election that was being conducted that day and the result was being transmitted to the Australian public, it was most unfortunate that the public was given the impression that the House of Representatives was the only important part of the election because it was the only thing that was really discussed that evening.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is important not only for the purpose of having information and some indication on election night as to the eventual result, but also to make sure that there is no inadvertent misconception or inadequate view given to the Australian public about the Senate and its importance. This Parliament is made up of two chambers. When elections are conducted, the results in the House of Representatives and the Senate are equally important.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee finds as follows in paragraph 4.30 of the report:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommends that the Australian Electoral Commission review its overall procedures for conducting and reporting the Senate count, particularly its data input procedures, to ensure an improved performance in the percentage of Senate vote counted and publicly announced for every State on election night at future elections.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thoroughly endorse that recommendation. I called for it and I am glad to see that is the finding of the Committee. I look forward to that being fully implemented by the Electoral Commission and to the Australian Government ensuring that resources are available for that to happen.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a footnote, I note that, at 11 o'clock on the last election night, in New South Wales only 3 per cent of Senate ballots had been counted; in Western Australia, 11 per cent; and in Tasmania, a substantial 68 per cent. My own State of South Australia had the second best percentage in that 58 per cent was counted. However, honourable senators will be dismayed to know that, even though that relatively large proportion was actually counted in Tasmania and South Australia, it was not transmitted through the media to the public. We had to wait until the next day to learn from the newspapers the results of the substantial counts in those two States.
       </para>
       <para>
        At 11 p.m., when most of the media coverage turned off, there could have been a report. So I am looking not only to the Australian Government to make resources available and the Electoral Commission to ensure that the procedures are in place, but also to the Australian media to ensure that the information made available to them on election night is transmitted in a systematic way, through periodic reports, so that the Australian public has the information and the reinforced perception that the Senate is equally important in the determination of vote.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, it is understood by us all that the Senate vote is much more complicated and that the final result of the Senate usually takes about a month to count, given the exact procedure for distributing preferences to determine the ultimate sixth position in most States.
       </para>
       <para>
        I again commend the Committee on all of its work. I commend Senator Kemp and Senator Faulkner, who are in the chamber, as members of the Committee, and I am particularly gratified that this report has included the recommendation I sought.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 so as to enable Australia to ratify Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions. Protocol I is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.
       </para>
       <para>
        When Australia ratifies Protocol I it will, at the same time, ratify Protocol II which is concerned with the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. However, Protocol II does not require legislative action to enable its ratification. Protocol II applies to situations of non-international armed conflicts between the armed forces of a Party and organised armed groups exercising some territorial control over territory of that Party. It does not apply to internal tensions, or disturbances such as riots or sporadic acts of violence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The application of humanitarian principles to international conflicts is, of course, an immensely difficult problem, especially where, as under the Protocols, distinctions are sought to be made between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although it is true that such distinctions can become blurred and indistinct, and ultimately may even cease to exist in conditions of total war, the reality remains that, in the period of 44 years during which total war has been avoided, there have been many limited wars with grave humanitarian consequences. Sadly, further such wars can be expected to occur and indeed our defence forces are currently engaged in such a conflict in the Middle East. It is in relation to conflicts such as these that the Protocols are especially capable of having an important and beneficial impact.
       </para>
       <para>
        While, for its part, Australia will continue to work tirelessly to achieve world peace, it must accept that limited wars are likely to continue and take appropriate action, such as is involved in the ratification of the Protocols, to promote international adherence to the humanitarian principles embodied in the Geneva Conventions and in these Protocols.
       </para>
       <para>
        If limited armed conflicts cannot be avoided, it is to be hoped that they will at least be conducted with some regard for the rights of civilians, and that belligerent nations will treat prisoners of war and wounded in accordance with internationally agreed principles. I note in this regard the important protections provided by the Protocols for particular categories of persons such as the wounded, sick and shipwrecked and civilian medical and religious personnel.
       </para>
       <para>
        It must be remembered that the Protocols were developed after exacting work by many bodies, in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross, over an extended period from the early 1950's. Finally, a Diplomatic Conference convened by the Swiss Federal Council held four sessions in Geneva from 1974 to 1977 to negotiate the final texts. The Australian delegation to these Conferences, which played a major and demanding role in the debates at the Conferences, was led by Mr Frank Mahony OBE, then Deputy Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        The length and arduous nature of the process of development of the Protocols reflects the great difficulties encountered in striking a balance between competing interests while maintaining the principle of absolute and unconditional respect for persons outside the conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        The frequent involvement of irregular forces in recent conflicts has made the process of obtaining support of some nations for the two Protocols more difficult. Nevertheless, some 99 nations have now ratified Protocol I and 89 have ratified Protocol II. The full ramifications of Australia's becoming party to the Protocols for the Australian Defence Force and for our civil defence arrangements have been exhaustively examined by the relevant authorities. That examination has revealed no reason for Australia not to proceed to ratification. Indeed, there is every reason to ratify and to encourage other nations to do likewise.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already mentioned the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the development of the Protocols. I should also like to take this opportunity to make special mention of the valuable contribution of the Australian Red Cross Society in this regard. A joint Government and Australian Red Cross Society Committee has been formed to discharge our obligations under the Geneva Conventions to disseminate information. The Committee will provide a vehicle for carrying out similar activities in relation to the Protocols.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill you have before you amends the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 (the Principal Act) to give effect to Australia's obligations under Protocol I. I turn now to a brief examination of those clauses of the Bill dealing directly with individual Articles of Protocol I.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, clause 5 of the Bill incorporates into the Principal Act the `grave breaches' which, under the Protocol, are required to be punished. These `grave breaches' are to be found in Article 11 and in paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of Article 85 of the Protocol. They include such acts as physical mutilations and medical experimentation involving prisoners of war or refugees and indiscriminate attacks involving excessive loss of life in the civilian population.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 6 provides for a certificate under the hand of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade certifying as to any relevant matter to be taken as prima facie evidence of that matter in any prosecution for a `grave breach'. This restates the existing status of such a certificate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 7 vests jurisdiction in State Supreme Courts to hear an application from a person who claims to be a prisoner of war for a declaration of his or her status.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally I wish to stress again the importance the Government places on Australia's ratification of these instruments. Despite their limitations, they do provide some measure of humanitarian protection for the victims of armed conflicts. I am aware that the Attorney-General has on a number of occasions called for bipartisan support for this vital humanitarian law reform and indeed the former Attorney-General adjourned debate to allow the Australian Red Cross Society to meet with the Coalition to try and persuade them to change their stance of opposition to the legislation. The Government therefore calls again upon all parties to state their commitment to the protections afforded by the Protocols and in particular to all the protections afforded to civilians caught up in the horrors of modern warfare.

        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        Part 2-Amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for improvements to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 which follow up the reforms to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) work force last year. These include changes to the review and appeal process designed to extend rights of review in a way which will enhance efforts to make the AFP a more unified work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        No longer will the right to review only apply within the same stream of appointment. In cases where a vacancy is advertised to be filled by either a police member or a non-police staff member it will be possible for a police member to seek a review of the promotion even if the vacancy is filled by a non-police staff member. The same rights will also apply if the vacancy is filled by a police member and a non-police staff member wants to seek a review. This change accords with the policy of promotion by merit and will bolster progress towards implementation of a unified work force. These policies are a key feature of employment within the AFP.
       </para>
       <para>
        This aspect of the Bill is another step in the process which is transforming the AFP into one of the more advanced government work forces. The new work force is designed to encourage a multi-disciplined approach to law enforcement. The Government has recognised that in a world where methods used by criminals are increasingly sophisticated, the nation's premier law enforcement body must be efficient and capable of fully utilising the talents of all its personnel. Establishment of a system of staff selection which is efficient and fair to all personnel is an important element in encouraging the development of a committed and fully utilised work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also underpin the capacity of the Minister responsible for the AFP and an administrator of an external Territory to enter into an arrangement for the AFP to police Territory laws. It will give the AFP functions, powers and duties in relation to those laws where an arrangement has been signed.

        Part 3-Amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act requires cash dealers to report suspicious transactions to the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. The Act contains a very strict regime for the secrecy of the information so supplied. Under subsection 16 (4), where a cash dealer has lodged a suspect transaction report, only the Director or `a relevant authority' as defined may require the cash dealer to provide further information. Clause 21 amends the definition of `relevant authority' to include a reference to the Australian Customs Service. Provision is made for access to information by the Australian Customs Service in other parts of the Act. However, by an oversight, the Australian Customs Service was not included as a `relevant authority' in section 16. This is remedied by the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 3 also amends the Act to take account of the pending change of name of the New South Wales State Drug Crime Commission to the Crime Commission of New South Wales.

       </para>
       <para>
        Part 4 amends the interpretative provisions of the Crimes Act and these changes are discussed in the explanatory memorandum. However, more importantly, it replaces section 76 of the Act-Obstructing, et cetera, public officers. The amendment precludes any adverse consequences which may flow from the decision of the South Australian Supreme Court in Austin v. Parsons (1986) 83 FLR 402 which sought to give a very narrow interpretation to the section. The new section is based largely upon that recommended by the Gibbs Committee in its recent interim report Principles of Criminal Responsibility and Other Matters. The new provision will apply only to conduct after commencement of the amendment.

        Part 5 and Schedule 1-Amendments to the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973

       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is a party to a number of international conventions, including the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation. These conventions deal with the problems associated with the disruption of international civil aviation by terrorism, hijacking, personal acts of violence, acts endangering the safety of aircraft in flight, and the destruction of, or interference with, aviation facilities. Part 5 of the Bill amends the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 to create the offences necessary to give effect to the protocol of the Montreal Convention. The protocol supplements the Convention, to which Australia and 136 other states are already parties, and is an important instrument designed to safeguard the safety of airports serving international civil aviation.
       </para>
       <para>
        To this end, the Bill makes it an offence for a person to unlawfully and intentionally perform an act of violence against a person at, or to disrupt the services of, an international airport. It is also an offence to damage the facilities of, or to damage any aircraft not in service located on, such an airport. In all cases it is necessary that the act endanger, or be likely to endanger, safety at that airport.

        Part 6-Amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 6 amends the Director of Public Prosecutions Act in order to create a separate statutory office of Associate Director. The need to create this position stems from the gradual extension of the statutory functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) since 1984. In March 1984 the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was primarily a prosecution agency with only a limited civil remedies function. However, since then, the civil remedies have been expanded and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 confers on the office a leading role in the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, additional powers have been conferred on the Director since the establishment of the Office. The Director is now empowered to sign ex officio indictments and to grant transactional indemnities against prosecution, powers that were previously exercised only by the Attorney-General. The Associate Director will be able to exercise all of the powers of the Director except the Director's power of delegation under section 31.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also extends the power of the DPP to give a use/derivative use indemnity in relation to evidence to be given in a broader range of State or Territory proceedings. If a person is to give evidence in a State or Territory proceeding, and that evidence may disclose the involvement of the witness in the commission of a Commonwealth offence, the Commonwealth DPP may give an undertaking that the evidence, and any further evidence that is derivative of it, will not be used against the witness in Commonwealth proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also ensure that the Director has such powers where the State or Territory proceeding is a coronial inquest or a proceeding before a body such as the New South Wales State Drug Crime Commission or the Independent Commission Against Corruption which is prescribed by regulation for this purpose.

        Part 7-Amendments of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Proceeds of Crime Act is being amended to pave the way for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to enact its own legislation dealing with the confiscation of criminal assets. At present the Proceeds of Crime Act applies to indictable offences against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory. `Territory' is defined to include the Australian Capital Territory. As a result, where a person is convicted of an indictable offence against the criminal law of the ACT any related confiscation proceedings are taken under the Commonwealth Act and any recoveries are paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ACT has indicated that it proposes enacting its own legislation dealing with the confiscation of criminally derived assets. In anticipation of this the Bill amends the definitions of `State' and `Territory' so that the ACT, like the Northern Territory, is treated as a State and the Commonwealth Act will cease to apply to offences against the laws of the ACT.
       </para>
       <para>
        The transitional arrangements are that the Commonwealth Act will continue to apply to any case in which action under the Commonwealth Act has already been taken at the commencement date. For example, if a monitoring order has been made, a search warrant has been issued or a restraining order has been granted in relation to a particular matter, all subsequent proceedings in relation to that matter will be taken under the Commonwealth Act notwithstanding the amendments made by the Bill.

        Part 8-Amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 8 of the Bill makes a number of minor amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. None of the amendments extends the interception powers under the Act. However, these amendments will facilitate the efficient operation of the Act and resolve a number of administrative difficulties in the operation of the Act as it affects law enforcement agencies. It may assist the House if I outline the major administrative and operational difficulties which the Bill addresses.
       </para>
       <para>
        A warrant issued under section 48 of the Act authorises both the installation and use of equipment to intercept communications on premises if the judge is satisfied that interception would be impracticable or inappropriate otherwise than by using such equipment. `Equipment' is defined for the purposes of the Act, and that definition specifically excludes a `line' which is also defined for the purposes of the Act. The use of a line may in fact be necessary in an interception under a section 48 warrant, and an unintended consequence of the definition of `equipment' is to exclude expressly the use of a line. The Bill will remedy this defect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsection 60 (1) of the Act requires the chief officer of an agency to which a warrant has been issued to cause the managing director of the relevant telecommunications carrier to be given a certified copy of the warrant forthwith. It is necessary to be able to locate a certifying officer as quickly as possible so that the necessary copy can be certified before the original warrant is forwarded to the Australian Federal Police for execution. The present definition of `certifying officer' has caused administrative difficulties because of the small number of persons able to certify a copy as being a true copy of the original. Only two persons fall within the definition in the New South Wales Police Force, and in Sydney, where applications by the NCA are usually made, there is only one member of the National Crime Authority who may certify copies. The new definition of `prescribed officer' in the Bill will extend the number of persons who are able to certify a warrant as being a true copy for the purposes of subsection 60 (1), by including assistant commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and officers of the police force of a State of equivalent rank, and an authorised member of the staff of the Senior Executive Service of the National Crime Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under section 79 of the Act, the chief officer of each agency is required to destroy information obtained from a lawful interception when the chief officer is satisfied that it is no longer needed for a permitted purpose. At present, the permitted purposes specified in the Act are nearly all matters connected with the investigation and prosecution of crimes. The Bill extends the definition of `permitted purpose' so that the chief officer is able to retain records, in the form of the number called by a target service, which may be used to comply with the record keeping provisions in part VIII of the Act. I should stress that information used for this purpose will not include the content of conversations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsections 81 (1) and (2) of the Act require the Commissioner of the AFP and the Chairman of the NCA respectively to cause specified particulars and statements to be recorded in writing as soon as practicable after the happening of the events to which the information relates. In fact the recording of information by both agencies is computerised. Since some doubt whether the use of the expression `in writing' authorises the recording of the information by computer, the amendments made to subsections 81 (1) and (2) by the Bill will enable this information to be recorded by means of a computer.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the preparation of the first annual report of the Minister under division 2 of part X of the Act, it became apparent that the obligation imposed by subsection 94 (3) on the Commissioner of the AFP and the Chairman of the NCA to provide information to be included in the ministerial report within two months after 30 June may in certain circumstances be impossible if all the information required by paragraphs 101 (1) (b) and (d) were included. Those paragraphs refer to an assessment of the average time for which warrants applied for during the relevant year were in force. Given that warrants may be issued for periods of up to three months, such an assessment could not be made if a warrant issued in the final month of the year under report remains in force more than two months into the new year. A similar amendment to section 35 will allow the complementary State legislation to be amended so that it also provides a three-month period for the provision of information.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also makes a number of consequential amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act following the change of name of the State Drug Crime Commission of New South Wales to the New South Wales Crime Commission and makes changes to correct minor drafting errors which were made in previous amendments to provisions of the Act.

        The Bill will enhance the efficiency of the National Crime Authority by enabling it to assemble and give evidence directly to the prosecuting authority. At present such material must be given to the Attorney-General or a law enforcement agency. This change was recommended by the InterGovernmental Committee on the National Crime Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second schedule to the Bill amends certain Acts to ensure that the Commonwealth retains full and effective control over the substantive elements of legislation which currently apply ACT laws for certain purposes. For example, several Commonwealth Acts apply ACT law in some external Territories or to activities aboard aircraft. However, on 1 July 1990 the ACT Government took over responsibility for criminal laws of the Territory. As a result, if the Commonwealth wished to amend the law applied by these enactments, it would have to specifically amend each of these Acts. I regard this position as unsatisfactory and as Jervis Bay Territory laws are currently the same as ACT laws but are subject to the ordinance making power of the Governor-General, I propose that Jervis Bay law be the law applied by these Acts. These amendments will mean that where the Commonwealth amends by ordinance the ACT law operating in Jervis Bay this will flow through automatically to other applied law regimes without the need for separate amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of those external territories which are currently subject to ACT laws the amendments will apply Jervis Bay Territory criminal laws but continue to apply ACT civil laws.

        The amendments to the AFP Act and the consequential amendments and the amendments to the NCA Act will have only a minor financial impact. It is not anticipated that the other measures proposed in the Bill will occasion any increased costs to the Commonwealth. I table the explanatory memorandum for this Bill, and commend the Bill to the House.

        Part 2 of this Bill amends the Industry Research and Development Act 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The need to amend the Act has been brought about by the Government's decision to extend the Grants for Industry Research and Development Scheme (known as ``GIRD''). This means that the Government's Industry Research and Development support measures have now all been extended and are thereby complementary.
       </para>
       <para>
        These schemes have been underway since the mid-1980s and have contributed to a marked increase in our industry research and development. The predecessors of the present schemes operated for well over a decade. This continuing support demonstrates to the business community the Government's determination to encourage innovation in industry as a basis for enhanced competitiveness and strength. Planning for R&amp; is necessarily a long-term commitment and I am pleased that the Government is able to encourage this through its package of support schemes. GIRD Grants will total approximately $32 million per annum for the next four years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Procurement Development Program (known as the `NPDP') is a relatively new component of the package. The concept of R&amp; specifically directed towards the purchasing requirements of government agencies shows great promise. It has already been embraced by the States and Territories in a truly national scheme. For these reasons, I am pleased to take this opportunity to bring the scheme into the Act, rather than continuing to operate under delegation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the Government's continuing strong commitment to encouraging innovation in Australian industry, it is also, of course, critical that the utmost value is obtained from outlays in R&amp; support. To this end, the schemes are under constant scrutiny. Furthermore, the Government will require comprehensive reviews of the schemes before committing funds past June 1994 (in the case of GIRD) and June 1992 (in the case of NPDP) the latter review is to be undertaken by the Industry Commission.

       </para>
       <para>
        The provision of accurate traceable measurements within a competent National Measurement infrastructure is important to the quality of manufactured products as well as to scientific and technical advancement.

         —Earlier in the day the Senate was debating a motion moved by Senator Robert Ray dealing with the question of disclosure of in camera evidence. In that debate, before I was interrupted by other business, I was saying that this matter involves a conflict between two principles: on the one hand, the principle of the need to respect in camera evidence and, on the other hand, the principle of the right of parliamentarians to use information in a way that they believe is in the best interests of the nation. For a long time it has been very difficult for the Parliament to balance those contrasting requirements and it has come to a head today in the Senate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Ray has adopted the majority position of the Committee-mind you, a majority of five votes against four votes-which is to apply a fairly strict restraint upon the use of this evidence, in particular that if it is evidence put before a committee it cannot be used unless the Committee or the Senate consents that agreement. The position adopted by the minority in the Committee was to give greater flexibility than that while accepting some restraint. The reason for greater flexibility was that we felt that a dissenting senator must have an ultimate right to use the information put before a committee to justify or otherwise explain that dissent. To use in camera evidence in this way would not be a path readily trodden by any senator. It is accepted that in principle this evidence must be respected. Only in very unusual circumstances should it be made public in this forum of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is my view that it is really only in unusual circumstances that the Committee should take in camera evidence. It has been my observation over a period of years that the practice has become more common. Evidence has often been taken in camera when it was unnecessary for that to be done. I urge committees, even the more sensitive committees, to be reluctant to do so. I can remember the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority arguing on a number of occasions that evidence being put before it really could be put in open hearing and that that was the preferable course of action rather than taking in camera evidence, which was almost an automatic temptation by the Committee. Of course, if the evidence is put in an open session before a committee, we do not run into this situation. But in unusual circumstances the Committee will require-because of a particular sensitivity in principle or because of a sensitivity in relation to personal matters of a witness-that the evidence be taken in camera. Then, only in the most extreme and unusual circumstances, should that privacy be abused.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, we think there needs to be greater flexibility for minority senators in these extreme and unusual circumstances. Therefore, we proposed an alternative, which is put in full in the Committee report that is before the Senate today and which I propose to move by way of amendment to Senator Robert Ray's motion in the first instance, if Senator Watson's amendment is not successful. That amendment would allow a dissenting senator, after all reasonable effort has been made by the Committee to reach agreement on the matter, to refer to that in camera evidence. We say in the proposed amendment that evidence should only be used to the extent necessary to support the reasoning of the dissent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Witnesses who gave evidence should, if at all practicable, be informed in advance of the proposed disclosure of the evidence and should be given a reasonable opportunity to object to that disclosure and to ask that particular parts not be disclosed. The Committee should give careful consideration to any objection by the witness before making its decision. Consideration should be given to disclosing the evidence in such a way as to conceal the identity of persons who gave the evidence or who were referred to in the evidence. That simply demonstrates the respect that is necessary for witnesses who give such evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that the Senate is at one on this. I think it is normally the practice in any event that a witness giving evidence in camera is advised in advance that there are circumstances in which that evidence might be made public. Certainly in those cases where it is not the practice, it is my view that that should be explained to the witness. The witness should not be under the impression that the evidence will not be disclosed under any circumstance.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one other matter that I shall mention now because I do not wish to speak separately to my amendment when I move it. It has been put to me that perhaps we have not given enough attention to the question of evidence put in camera that is of a national security nature. It has been put to me, and I see the merit of the argument, that that is one area in relation to some evidence perhaps where there should not be an option-even in the sort of extreme circumstances that I have in mind that would apply to this amendment that such evidence should not be made public. Senator Newman in particular has raised that with me. I do think that even if the amendment that I propose to move is carried, that aspect should be looked at again by the Procedure Committee. I would suggest that that be the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, this point has been raised with me in relation to certain evidence that gets put before the National Crime Authority. As the Senate is aware, the National Crime Authority does not take operational information but there may be evidence put before it which could in some way, if made public, benefit criminal elements. It may relate to the capacities of a police force or information about the nature of certain criminal networks. It may not relate to a particular operation but, nevertheless, if those involved in the criminal world became aware that this information was in the hands of police through its being put into the Parliament as a result of being taken up through the National Crime Authority, followed by a dissenting report and then certain in camera evidence being made public, that would not be desirable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that there is debate at the moment about legislative amendment to the National Crime Authority Act which might help to overcome this possibility. But if that is not the case, I would also suggest that at some time in the future, if my amendment is carried, the Procedure Committee might look at this aspect again.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject to that, I foreshadow that in a moment or two, after Senator Watson's amendment is dealt with, I shall seek to move the amendment which has been circulated and which is set out in detail in terms of the minority report. This will give minority senators who are dissenting to a report of a committee some further flexibility. Nevertheless, I think the amendment reasonably respects the interests of the person who happens to be giving in camera evidence.

I do not think we have quite resolved the conflicting issues that we first outlined at the start of the debate.

        I do not like leaving in the hands of a witness whether something should be published or not. We discussed this matter in the Procedure Committee. Senator Reid pressed the matter several times and was the only one to support it. In fairness, I am trying to reflect both the majority and minority view on the Committee. Therefore, I think it should be rejected.

        I want to make one other point. Several times Opposition senators have referred to this motion being carried 5-4. I do not think anybody has alleged that it was carried in a number crunching way. It was simply a matter of having a proposition to debate, knowing that there would be an alternative proposition. In my experience on the Procedure Committee, we have not too often resolved matters by a hard vote. In fact, I have been on the Committee since August 1981, initially in another form, and I have yet to recall an actual real vote. That could have occurred-my attention sometimes wanders a little at these meetings. I would indicate that from my point of view, representing some members of the Committee, I do not accept Senator Watson's amendment.

        A dissenting Senator who wishes to refer to in camera evidence should advise the committee of the evidence concerned, and all reasonable effort should be made by the committee to reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for that purpose. If agreement is not reached, the dissenting Senator may refer to the in camera evidence in the dissent only to the extent necessary to support the reasoning of the dissent. Witnesses who gave the evidence in question should, if it is practicable, be informed in advance of the proposed disclosure of the evidence and should be given reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure and to ask that particular parts of the evidence not be disclosed. The committee should give careful consideration to any objection by a witness before making its decision. Consideration should be given to disclosing the evidence in such a way as to conceal the identity of persons who gave the evidence or who are referred to in the evidence.''.

         —I think it is very important that we adopt this proposal. As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration I have always been one of those concerned about the timely tabling of reports. One problem about the Parliament not sitting for, sometimes, a period of a couple of months is that reports that become available for tabling then have to wait those couple of months before being available. Of course, it means that the department or authority concerned has, as the date of tabling their report, a date those couple of months further down the track than when it was strictly available.

       <para>
        The point is that if a report becomes available on 5 January, as happens with committee reports, it can be tabled with the President and thereby become available. That is the date that it is recognised as having been available. Of course, as Senator Robert Ray points out, paragraph (d) of the proposal states:

        That is the point at which a motion to take note of the document would be available and for the matter to be dealt with. This proposal really ensures that matters that members, senators and the public generally are concerned about get on to the public record as soon as possible.

        On the other side of the coin, the difficulty might well be under present circumstances that the Government may well have a document relating to conduct which has findings in it which, it may be concluded, are defamatory in respect of individuals. It may be that it, therefore, presents it to the Parliament. I think that is what happened in Western Australia with the McCusker report. The Government wanted to table it in Parliament because of some difficulties and this, at least, overcomes that problem, because if it is presented to the President it is deemed to have been presented to the Senate. As I say, it provides a mechanism to allow the Government to get the documents out on the public record without debate for some time.

        That the orders of the Senate of 5 December 1989 relating to the referral of Bills to committees cease to have effect on 1 July 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this was carried at the time of the Committee without opposition but that some opposition has emerged. It relates to the new committee procedures. It relates to the debate on 5 December. Indeed, when we had this debate on the committees as to whether we would set up this new committee system, there was some confusion on the floor of the Parliament. Senator Chaney and I both intended that this committee system should be experimental, should be reviewed at an appropriate time, and should be a sessional order rather than a continuing order.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true to say that a lot of technicalities and election dates have made it totally unclear as to precisely when that would occur. The intention of the Procedure Committee is to make that review much more likely by putting a sunset clause in on the current committee system so that we will be sure to get a report back before that sunset clause comes into effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not making any judgment as to whether I believe the current committee system-that is, the reference of Bills after the second reading stage to the committee stage debate-is working. I have seen some quite good examples and some very moderate examples of how well it has worked. Various Ministers and various committee members from all sides bring back different reports. All I say is that the jury is still out, but we had better have a look at it at some stage. It was never intended to go on forever without review. This resolution makes it quite clear that there is a sunset clause that will force a review. We would need the results of the review-I suggest before this sitting period ends-so that we can look at that and continue it as it is, not continue it at all, or modify it according to the appropriate means.

         —As I understand it, there is already a sunset provision in that the amendment which was moved by Senator Robert Ray and accepted by the Senate on 5 December 1989 provided that it would operate for a parliamentary session. That amendment seems to have overtaken a provision that was in the motion as put before the Senate by the Committee, which was for it to operate as a continuing order of the Senate. The only discussion really is what is the most appropriate date for a sunset clause-whether it now needs to be brought forward. As I understand the argument, it is that the election took place before these provisions actually came into effect and, therefore, there was no session between the passing of the original motion and the completion of a session. Therefore, the provision that we now find ourselves with is one that was to commence on the first day of the sitting after the election and to operate for the session. As I understood it, and as a result of Senator Ray's amendment, it was accepted that it was not intended to have a continuing effect but that it was to be for a trial period for a reasonable time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is my view-and I have to confess that at the time of discussion of this briefly in the Committee I was not properly aware of some of those finer details, which is my fault-that that does not affect the merits of the case at the moment. It is my view-particularly from the experience we have had that it is taking a while for this new procedure to evolve-that there ought to be a reasonably lengthy trial period. Already we have seen considerable improvement from our first steps after implementation of the new procedure. Already we have by informal arrangement modified some of the original thoughts as to operation that we had on all sides of the chamber. We realise that some further modifications are still necessary and that the procedures can continue to be improved. In other words, the judgment that has to be made in due course can be made on a system that still has room to be improved and to operate better than it is at the moment.

In May, the Committee might decide to look at it again during the Budget session. I do think that it would be just a little too precipitous at the moment and not give the new system a fair trial if the cut-off date was brought in as of 30 June 1991, which is only a few months away. We are not arguing with the principle that it is for a trial period; we are not arguing that it needs to be reviewed by the Procedure Committee; I am saying on reflection that at the moment the date that has been put in this motion-at the end of this financial year-is a little too early for a fair judgment to be made of the operation of the new system.

         —I endorse much of what Senator Hill has said. I am not a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure, as honourable senators would know, and I can imagine how, meeting in order to get a report to the Senate by December 1990, that Committee made the recommendation which is before us now as a motion because the teething troubles of the first period of sitting using this new committee system were considerable. We have in my Party room discussed its operations already this year. Several of my colleagues have had what they consider to be, both on their behalf and also on behalf of many organisations in the community, a very good experience, although we had to grapple for quite some time with this system.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I agree with Senator Hill that there is still a way to go and I am very happy with that part of the recommendation which suggests that a review is still in the hands of the Procedure Committee with recommendations due in May. Clearly, we have more work to do and we are all in the position of looking at it and seeing how it works as we go into it in the new sitting period. We would be unhappy in supporting the motion which the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) has put because we think that the other aspect of the report which talks about the review is the way we would prefer it to be. To have, in effect, the thing killed off on 1 July I think would affect the way we all operate with the system between now and then. Accepting that a review is taking place is a more positive environment in which to use the system for this six-month period or until May. At that time we will have a much better perspective on the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say all this in the context of leading a party for which it is an enormous burden to work with this system. All of my colleagues carry four or five portfolios and sit on three or four committees, some of which are not in their portfolio areas. It is very difficult for us to service that system properly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, it is of benefit in developing better legislation and, particularly, in giving a voice to people in the community on legislation. We are happy with that aspect of this Committee report which says there is a review and recommendations will come before the Senate in May. We look forward to those recommendations.

         —I will make a few brief remarks about this matter. I do not want to get into the merits of the system that has been adopted; that is a debate for another day. I want to make it clear that the reason for this proposal is to attempt, at this late stage, to implement what was the clear intention of the Senate in December 1989. It was that there be a short experiment with this referral of Bills to committee procedure. Even if the sunset clause of June 1991 is adopted, the experiment will still be a lot longer than was originally intended.

        I invite anybody in the chamber to talk to former Senator Chaney about what his intention was in agreeing that the matter ought to be a sessional order as adopted in the last session of the Parliament. It was adopted as a sessional order, in order that it would come to an end when the Parliament was next prorogued; that is, at election time. Senator Chaney, in his confidence about winning the election, made it clear in discussion when the amendment was moved to change it from a continuing order to a sessional order that he did not want to have the system set in concrete without there being a new decision after the election. As it happened, the election occurred before the Parliament sat again at the beginning of 1990 and that session came to an end.
       </para>
       <para>
        My argument, all along, has been that what was adopted in December 1989 as a sessional order should have come to an end at the end of that session; that is, at the dissolution of the House of Representatives. That did not happen because priority was given to observing the other leg of the procedure, which was that it commence on the first sitting day of 1990. At the very least, those two clauses were ambiguous. But, despite the fact that it was a sessional order which should have been terminated and should have required a new decision in the new session, the commencing date of the first sitting day of 1990 was observed rather than the status as a sessional order.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hence I want to emphasise the need to have a sunset clause on the matter so that there is some pressure on the Procedure Committee and the Senate itself to have its review which is being proposed for May. I venture to suggest that if there is no June 1991 sunset clause the May 1991 review will not happen and will not be dealt with in May 1991. It will drift on, as with so much else in this place, until much later in the year. The period of operation will continue to drift on and will end up going until the end of the session which will probably be the end of 1992 or early 1993 without having the proper review as was originally intended.

         —I would like to make a few brief comments. As a new senator, my first impression coming into this chamber and listening to Question Time was that the Chair had very little control over the answers of Ministers. I was very pleased to learn that the arm of the President is well buttressed by a series of Standing Orders and precedents, which give the President quite substantial control over the way questions are asked and the way answers are given. I was pleased to read in the report that the Standing Orders and precedents are actually detailed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Honourable senators who have had the opportunity to witness the degeneration of Question Time in the other place over recent years will recognise the importance of Senate rules. We must all have some considerable sympathy for you, Mr President, for what you inevitably face in enforcing the Standing Orders. The report indicates-and I happen to agree with this aspect of it-that the rules applying to answers are not as strictly enforced as they might be. It also points out that the rules applying to questions are also not as strictly enforced as they might be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy President, I recognise that there must inevitably be some considerable discretion given to the Chair on making judgments on issues such as the relevance of answers. However, it is important in my view to note that the Chair does not have the right to ignore Standing Orders or, through a very loose interpretation, to alter substantially the guiding rules under which Question Time operates. Nor, in my view, does the Chair have the right to substitute other rules which have not been debated or accepted by this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        Changes in Standing Orders can, of course, only be made by this chamber. It therefore causes me some concern, and I hope it may cause some concern to my colleagues, to read in the report the view that Question Time is better conducted with a liberal application of rules and with minimum intervention by the Chair. I do not believe this is the case. As I have said, looking at the practice in the other place, we have seen what in fact happens when standing orders are not effectively and appropriately applied. But also, my comment is sustained by reference to the experience in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, a very liberal application of the rules has meant that, too often, Ministers have been able to get away with long, rambling answers which are often used to gratuitously attack the Opposition and avoid providing the information which has been sought by the questioner. Odgers points out in his standard work, Australian Senate Practice, that Question Time is:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the most obvious manifestation of responsible Government, i.e. the direct accountability of the Executive to the Parliament.

       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, the number of questions asked during Question Time has fallen under this Government, averaging some 22 per day per Question Time compared with around 28 questions per day under the Fraser and Whitlam governments. It is probably worth recording that prior to 1972 the number of questions per day averaged over 30, including supplementaries. In 1971, for example, over 33 questions were asked on average per day, and indeed answered.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report suggests that the number of questions has been increasing in recent times. I do not think that is sustained by the statistics. In the last two sitting weeks in December, the number of questions averaged only 22-roughly in line with the average since the advent of the Hawke Government. It is pleasing to read in the report that the President has positively responded to the wish of honourable senators that there should be a tighter application of rules applying to Question Time. I have the strong view that we should aim to achieve a target of 28 questions, including supplementaries, during Question Time. This would restore previous practice.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy President, I will continue. Twenty-eight questions can be achieved, even by this Government. On some three occasions since the election this target number has been achieved or exceeded. If 28 questions are not achieved then, in my view, Question Time should be extended until the target number is reached. Mr Hawke has set a target number for the House of Representatives. Senator Faulkner may snigger but his own Prime Minister believes there should be a target number. In my view, the target number in the other place is too low but nonetheless, I welcome the acceptance that there should be a target number of questions asked during Question Time. I would urge the Government to adopt a similar practice in this Senate.

       <para>
        I believe that the tolerance shown by this chamber to Government Ministers is rapidly running out. I predict that unless the performance of Ministers during Question Time rapidly improves, the Senate itself will change the rules relating to Question Time. Let the Ministers recall the precedent that was established by Senator Lionel Murphy when he was Leader of the Opposition. This is what Lionel Murphy, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, did in 1967. He moved a motion which gave unlimited time to Question Time to ensure that all honourable senators with questions had the opportunity to ask them.

All I am urging on this chamber-and I am surprised I have been subjected to the abuse by the Minister at the desk, Senator Robert Ray-is that Question Time achieve a standard of performance which has been achieved by previous governments in previous decades. I am not urging that it be tightly constrained by rules, but I am urging that we should see a tighter application of standing orders. I believe that the consequences of not doing that will require this chamber-and I am sure it will receive the support of the majority of honourable senators-to restore tighter rules to Question Time.

         It is also a point of view that was taken by some of my colleagues in New Zealand where only a few years ago a new Speaker strictly applied the Standing Orders at Question Time. For the first couple of months everybody thought he was good but then it developed into chaos. I have some figures here that give the number of questions, the number of supplementaries, the total, the sitting days and the average for every year since 1981 until the end of 1990.

Again, the reason for mentioning that is that now we have four parties and a number of Independents in this chamber, it is a much more combative chamber. I have found in my experience that we have a much more structured Question Time than we ever had before 1981. Certainly from when I was elected in 1975 and 1981, we had a much less structured Question Time. I believe that the structured Question Time we have at the moment leads to a great deal of frustration, particularly for the Opposition backbenchers, in trying to ask a question.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         Let me just give the Senate an example of what a normal day is at Question Time: five Liberal questions, two Democrat questions, one from the National Party, one from the Independent, seven from the Government, and with three or four supplementaries, quite often one backbench Opposition member gets one question during Question Time which has perhaps averaged 21 or 22 questions. Of course, we have got a structured Question Time, which is something the Opposition wants. It has been a long time since the Opposition has not handed me a list and said that I have got an open Question Time. If one looks at when we did have an open Question Time, the Senate often did get 28 questions. But it will never get 28 questions whilst we have a structured Question Time.
        </para>
        <para>
         You, Mr Deputy President, and I remember coming into this chamber when there were 28 or 30 questions a day. Often, as a new backbencher, one would get two questions quite easily during Question Time. There was not the structured Question Time that we have today.
        </para>
        <para>
         But let me point out to Senator Kemp and to other senators that in 1990 we averaged 22.6 questions per sitting day. In other years to 1984 we had 20.7, 19.5, 21, 22, 22 and 23. In fact, last year was the best year with the most questions asked since 1984. In 1983 we had 20; in 1982, 23.1; and in 1981, 25.2.
        </para>
        <para>
         I wish to make a few other points. It is very hard for me to decide in the chair whether the answer a Minister is giving is becoming a debate. I would point out, particularly to some members of the Opposition, that when a point of order is taken very early in the Minister's answer it is impossible for me to determine when that answer is going to become a debate.
        </para>
        <para>
         We also have the problem of the Chair deciding when a Minister's answer has been too long. If honourable senators want me to introduce a time limit, I will. But I just say to the Senate that I believe that that would be another disaster. I believe that, in implementing a time limit on the asking of a question, a time limit on the answering of the question and a time limit on supplementaries, we would get 14 or 15 questions in the hour if we were lucky. I say that because I have sat here and seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), for example, take eight minutes to answer a question and there has not been the slightest objection and no point of order. I have seen another Minister go for three minutes and a point of order has been taken purely because of the way that Minister is answering the question. So I come down very strongly in support of the Procedure Committee report.
        </para>
        <para>
         I say again to Senator Kemp and others: have a look at the table of questions which goes back to 1981 that I have now put into the Hansard. If they think of the political changes that have occurred in the Senate since 1981, I think they would have to agree that last year was very good year by comparison.

         —It is not a matter of every other government being able to achieve that. I think honourable senators have to look at the quality of the whole operation. If we want to, we can have a rigorous administration of Question Time, as happens in the House of Representatives. I saw a part of the House of Representatives Question Time today. One of the front bench members of the Opposition sought to provide a quote as a preface to a question. Because the House of Representatives is more rigorous about the nature of questions, the Speaker attempted to make him come to his question very rapidly.

       <para>
        Of course, in the Senate there is-one might even use the words-a more civilised atmosphere at Question Time. Members of the Opposition, in the framing of their questions, can get away with much more as far as presenting information as a preamble to a question is concerned. All sorts of things are supposedly ruled out by the Standing Orders in the nature of questions-arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, ironical expressions and hypothetical matter. Those sorts of things are, in a reasonable administration of Question Time, allowed quite reasonably and everybody gets on in a much less gladiatorial way than would occur if there were to be a very strict administration of Question Time.

       <para>
        I would like to ask members of the Opposition, in view of their criticism, to think about the fact that there has been a change in the last couple of years in the nature of the structure of government which has affected the way in which Ministers are able to answer questions in the Senate. At the moment, six of the eight Ministers who are answering questions in the Senate are in the Cabinet. I think that is an unusually high number--

         —No advertising, please. I have not done an analysis, but my impression is that several years ago there was a much smaller number who were in the Cabinet. When we had 27 or 28 departments, there was a much greater proportion of questions to Ministers representing Ministers in the House of Representatives and there was an inability to answer straight away all questions that came up. Hence, many more questions would have been answered quickly because the Minister representing was able to say that he did not have a brief on the matter and that he would refer the question to the appropriate Minister. We now have a situation where senators have a right to expect more substantial answers because of the fewer number of departments in the current ministerial structure.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is a higher proportion of Ministers who are in the Cabinet and, therefore, they are fully responsible for the portfolios they are administering. Even in the case of Senators Tate and Collins, who are not in the Cabinet, their portfolio responsibilities are broad enough to provide for them to answer in a quite substantial way. So simplistic comparisons of numbers do not necessarily reflect the way in which questions are answered.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the President does an excellent job in balancing the need for Ministers to provide sufficient information in reply. He displays a great tolerance in respect of the way in which questions are drafted by those who are asking them. The way in which Question Time is administered here is very reasonable and I think it would not be in either side's interests to try to be very much tighter in this respect.

        I did not address these issues; I simply moved the motion to take note and thought I might respond to any intelligent comments that had been made. Maybe I should sit down. What we heard from Senator Kemp today is just the normal Opposition mentality-that is, Question Time should really be like Little Big Horn all over again; the Opposition can go downhill with the breeze and we are not allowed to fight back while being chopped to pieces. It is not like that, Senator Kemp. Question Time is a very combative thing. In this chamber it is more combative than anywhere else in the world. It has evolved that way, although I have no idea why.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we are on the subject of questions, let us go to questions rather than answers. Let me say something about the length of questions. I think Senator McLean would agree that his question to me today just scraped into one page. So the questions are getting longer. As well as the questions getting longer, we are also at the point that I think Senator Coates referred to. Ministers in this chamber have direct responsibility for the Departments of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Social Security, and Administrative Services. A lot of the bigger departments of government are represented here, so we are much more likely to get detailed questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The day of the single-phrased question has gone; it is always four or five points. Members of the Opposition hope that the Minister cannot get it down in time and so will forget one, and hope that we will have supplementary questions, whether they are required or not. The growth of supplementary questions has skyrocketed in recent years. I think Senator Kemp said that some days are worse than others. I agree with him that some days have not been the best. Sometimes I have said to my colleagues that I think we should shorten the questions, then we get interrupted with inane points of order that have no relevance to the Standing Orders; they are just argumentation. So I send another note down, `Don't bother. If they're not going to cooperate, we won't.' I think the point is that I discerned-obviously Senator Kemp has not-some attempt on this side towards the end of last year to try to get more questions answered.

        I think the most inane and vacuous statement coming from Senator Kemp is that the Standing Orders should be applied strictly. I ask honourable senators to take their minds back to questions that have been asked in the last two days to see whether any of them could have got through the following rules: questions should not contain statements of fact or names of persons unless they are strictly necessary to render the question intelligible and can be authenticated. Honourable senators should think of Senator Vallentine's question today that could not be authenticated. It should have been bowled out under the Standing Orders. There should be no arguments in questions. Well, goodbye Senator Short! Every one of his questions contains argumentation. Questions should not contain inferences. Goodbye Senator Alston! Every one of his questions has inferences. Questions should not contain imputations-there were only a few, but a few more will get them. They should not contain epithets or ironical expressions. There is not much sense of humour opposite. Senator Harradine is looking my way. Quite a lot of his questions have that whimsy and irony when he asks them. So we have to bowl all his questions out.

The clearest example of that that I ever went through in this chamber-I will conclude on this note-was reading Senator Fred Chaney's great speech on four-year terms made in 1974 when he was vigorously opposed to it because he was in Opposition; in 1977, he was fervently in favour of it; and in 1988-89 he was fervently opposed again. Those opposite should draw a line down the middle of the chamber and, depending on which side they are sitting on, they will look at things from a different perspective. I agree that in Question Time we should try to get more numbers up and keep questions relevant and short.

         —Those opposite should keep their questions short as well-it applies to both sides-cut out vacuous points of order and cooperate, and we may see a gradual improvement. I think we are starting to see a partial improvement at the moment. I can tell honourable senators that they will not be able to legislate for it by changing these rules because it is difficult for any Presiding Officer-be it Senator Sibraa, Senator Colston or anyone else-in the chair to interpret when and where to draw the line. I am really surprised that members of the Opposition come in here and suggest that these rules should be enforced. If we take a point of order tomorrow on all questions and 90 per cent are knocked out, those opposite would want to go to the barricades as we are being undemocratic and unfair. In conclusion, I agree a bit with Paul Keating. I think that Question Time is a privilege extended by the Government to the Opposition.

         —by leave-I was called from the chamber, but upon returning I listened to some of the colourful contribution of Senator Robert Ray. Lest what we on this side of the chamber are seeking be misinterpreted, I think it important to remind the Senate that the Opposition members on this Committee state in the report before the chamber that we consider that the rules relating to Question Time should be applied with the aim of achieving more questions and answers per day.

        We accept the goodwill and good faith of the President, but the debate within the Procedure Committee was really along the lines that there can still be goodwill and good faith but that a stricter interpretation of the rules applying to both the asking of questions and the answering of questions would allow the asking and answering of more questions during the period of one hour. It is that sentiment that we are simply seeking to communicate in this debate. We do not want the type of interpretation that I think Senator Robert Ray alluded to, which would simply lead to a breakdown of the functioning of Question Time. I agree that there must be some element of commonsense in the interpretation. As a senator in this place I think it could be tightened further and could achieve the objective we think is desirable, which is getting more questions asked and answered while still maintaining the spirit that I think the President has sought to maintain from the chair.

        I think this matter came out of a reference that the Chairman may have made in this chamber at the start of the last Committee of the Whole. The initial intention was to draw up a new committee procedure which had various checks and balances. Quite frankly, it was a bit of turkey for the plate for both the Opposition and the Government. It was all a bit of a trade; we would all go forward and we would all get something out of it. One of the things we were supposed to get out of it was that, when questions came up in an Estimates committee, certain matters referred to in the Estimates committee report would then be debated in the Committee of the Whole, which would lessen the debate in the Committee of the Whole, which sometimes gets up to 20, 30 or 40 hours. That worked only moderately the first time. The second time a new device was found: the Government was receiving letters saying, `I reserve my 167 questions' or, `I reserve my 1,432 questions'. They could all come up in the chamber and it totally subverted the intent of the reforms at the time. That is the problem. In my view, it is a breach of faith in some ways. I do not see how one can possibly solve the problem by restriction. I could think up various Standing Orders, but I know that the moment I think one up another device will be dodged through the back door. The only thing I can do-and I hope I never have to implement it-is threaten vengeance. The sacrifice I have to make to achieve that vengeance is to sit over that side and I do not intend to do so. If I do, Senator Kemp, and you are a Minister, you will pay.

         —I am not talking about Defence; I am talking about my particular interests-community services, health and social security. We do not get the answers before the Committee of the Whole. If we do not get the answers or if we get them in a few minutes before the Committee of the Whole, how can we possibly decide whether there will be a need for further questioning? That is the first issue. The second issue-and I am sure this will happen to Senator Ray when he is in opposition; I am quite sure it will happen to him pretty soon-is that we get answers from the officers at the table and people who are interested in those responses say to us, `You were not told the truth. This, indeed, is what occurs and that officer diddled you'; or, `You did not go far enough with your question. He took you very literally and he did not give you the full answer. He did not say, ``Well, you are right, senator, actually, but had you asked this particular question I could have given you a different answer, had you just gone an inch further''.' For those reasons it is necessary for further debate in the Committee of the Whole. When one is given information by someone outside that one has been misinformed during the Estimates committee, either from the lack of a precise question that one should have asked to get the truthful answer or because of a frank lack of knowledge by the departmental officers-I am not saying deliberate lies; I am saying lack of knowledge, perhaps-it becomes necessary for one to defend one's position and to be able to reserve one's right to re-ask the question in the correct term and get the correct answer in the Committee of the Whole.

        Senator Ray will enjoy that privilege when he is in opposition; he will be given the same sort of information that we are given, and that I have been given, and he will want the same sort of opportunity to question the Minister on the additional detail. I am prepared for the Minister to have that in a very short time. I am very happy for the Minister to have that, because we work in a different way on this side; we always have. During Estimates committees when we were in government-and Senator Ray can ask my friend Senator Kemp-the Ministers were questioned very closely by government senators because they often saw it as a way of questioning the bureaucrats on their incompetence and we had very constructive Estimates committees. That does not occur now.

      <para>
       This motion has been around for some time, so I will have to regroup and think of some of the arguments. One of the things we did last session was to restructure sitting times essentially to say that in future we would have ministerial statements on a Thursday and would sit on the Thursday night of the second week. We also went to the Friday committee system. One of the suggestions that I brought forward was that the debate we went through today, the consideration of committee reports, should be held on a Thursday after the consideration of general business. To some extent, along with ministerial statements, that blocks out a long section of the parliament's proceedings, either to private business or business of the Senate, and gives Government business a better run on a Wednesday.
      </para>
      <para>
       This matter has not been particularly discussed between the parties. It has been hanging around- I think I have put five notices of motion to put it off-and no-one seems to be enthused either to oppose it or support it. I would not be broken hearted if it did not get up, but I think it is more logical that committee reports be dealt with on a Thursday rather than on a Wednesday.

       I have to say that from an Opposition point of view-actually, from a senatorial point of view-there have been some concerns expressed among my colleagues which might be answerable. I will therefore raise them. There is a concern that the consideration of committee reports will potentially be squeezed off the list by either a ministerial statement which is introduced during the day on which there is debate or, alternatively, a ministerial response to a committee report. In other words, we are putting this aspect of committee reports further down the sitting week. We are taking pressure off the Government's program in the earlier part of the week, but as the pressure increases as the week continues, there is the danger that a squeeze will occur. It might be this aspect of business, which individual senators regard as very important, which suffers. We express those concerns. I think the sentiment in the chamber, following my brief discussion with the Australian Democrats, is that the change should be given a go.

He would also appreciate that senators regard this as an important function. But, if it was in place until the end of this sitting, we would have an opportunity to see how it worked. If it works without this extra stress occurring and inhibiting individual senators in their rights in this regard, then no doubt it could be easily extended.

        —I am trying to encourage honourable senators opposite. Private senators' business is made up of the various matters of general business dealing with consideration of committee reports and so forth. I would have thought it need not always be after the time for general business. It could be before or after, but it means that Thursday afternoons and evenings on both first and second sitting weeks would effectively be open to the non-government parties to determine how to administer it. If they wanted, on certain occasions, to give priority to consideration of committee reports, they could; if on other occasions they wanted to give priority to a general business Bill, then so be it. I think it is a useful consolidation of time.

       I point out to Senator Hill that there have been quite a number of Wednesdays over the years when honourable senators have not had the full hour on committee reports with the 7.30 adjournment because some other major matter has taken precedence. There is probably more chance of getting time for committee reports if they are dealt with on a Thursday.

So I can see the reason for complaint. But no complaint has much relevance when we consider that Estimates Committee A sat for 60 hours and 14 minutes. That is a matter it can sort out for itself, as long as most of us are not on it. I think we would all agree with that. We will leave that Committee with it.

         —This evening I will make some comments relating to government funding-I should say taxpayer funding-of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). As part of the ACTU President's new year's message to Australia he was kind enough to inform the public:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The ACTU is part and parcel of the Government of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will not surprise honourable senators on this side of the chamber. We have long argued that Bill Kelty is in fact a senior member of Mr Hawke's Cabinet. Undoubtedly, Senator Robert Ray could easily confirm that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Kelty of the ACTU wields a veto power over government policy. We, in this chamber, can all recall for example how Mr Keating's consumption tax proposal was vetoed by Mr Kelty. It is surprising that Mr Ferguson is prepared to openly inform the public of the fact that the ACTU and the Government are one and the same-indivisible, inseparable. This will certainly confirm the worst fears and suspicions of the public. They did not elect Mr Ferguson and Mr Kelty and the other ACTU functionaries to be part of the government of this country. They know that the influence of Mr Kelty and the ACTU is one of the major reasons that the reform process in this country has ground to a halt before it has in fact hardly started.
       </para>
       <para>
        As an aside, one may reflect-drawing on Mr Ferguson's comments-on the fact that if the ACTU is part of the Government, where does that leave the ACTU when the Government falls? Presumably, the ACTU will not object to a greatly diminished role under a coalition government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a good thing for the ACTU that the public did not have a chance to vote on whether they wanted the ACTU to be part of the Government. Opinion poll after opinion poll shows that the public believe that the trade union movement already has too much power. In fact, in a recent poll that has come to my attention over two-thirds of Australians, including a majority of trade union members, agree with the proposition that the trade unions have too much power.
       </para>
       <para>
        The arrogance of the ACTU bosses has reached unprecedented levels. Last month we had the astonishing spectacle of Mr Ferguson demanding $10,000 from the organisers of the Australian open tennis championship if they wished to avoid the disruption of the championship. In most circles this type of behaviour would be regarded more akin to extortion or blackmail. We read in the press that the trade union bosses tried to censor a film made by Mr Tom Zubrycki on the history of the trade union movement entitled Amongst Equals.

         —It was paid for by the taxpayers; it cost the taxpayers to the tune, I believe, of $200,000 to make a film about the glories of the trade union movement. According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 15 January:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . if Martin Ferguson . . . has his way, you will never see `Amongst Equals' as it was made. It will either be locked away in ACTU House in Melbourne or heavily edited-rewritten in other words.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apparently Mr Ferguson and the former ACTU president, Mr Crean, now a Minister of this Government, did not like the reporting on the Robe River dispute and believed that the film did not pay sufficient attention to the prices and incomes accord. In most circles such behaviour by an individual to censor the work of an artist would be more typical of Ceausescu than a leader in a liberal democratic society. It is this type of arrogance, this lack of respect for proper proprieties and form, which has led the ACTU to place itself in a totally untenable position regarding the use of taxpayer funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the last session I requested information from all departments on grants that they had made to the ACTU during the term of the Hawke Government. I am now in a position to report to the Senate on the answers that I have received from the Ministers of the Hawke Government. I stress that the figures I will be quoting for these grants were made only to the ACTU; they do not involve grants made to other sections of the trade movement section. Senator Short has detailed the huge extent of grants made by the Government from taxpayers' funds to the trade union movement generally. His research showed that the Hawke Government has provided over $25m to trade unions since it came into office. This includes some $7m in the current financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ACTU is the largest individual union recipient of these grants. Overall, the Hawke Government will make grants to the ACTU in the order of a huge $4m this financial year-this is $4m of my dollars, your dollars, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Senator Collins's dollars-the dollars of taxpayers given to the ACTU which, as Mr Ferguson tells us, is part and parcel of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that the taxpayer pays more to the ACTU than do its affiliates. Perhaps the taxpayer feels more affectionate towards the ACTU than do its members. That is one inference that people could draw from these figures, but it is a most unlikely inference.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ACTU's statement of income and expenditure shows that in 1987-the latest accounts which are available; I was able to obtain these accounts last week-the ACTU received $2.5m from affiliation fees. Just remember: the ACTU got $4m from the taxpayer and $2.5m in affiliation fees. Maybe in the current year the ACTU has been able to get more in affiliation fees; I could not find out. The contrasting figures we have before us are: $4m taxpayers' dollars and $2.5m affiliation fees from other trade unions. Since 1983, when it came into government, the Hawke Government has granted an incredible $11.6m to the ACTU.
       </para>
       <para>
        I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which summarise grants made by the Government to the ACTU. The first table relates to the current financial year and the second table summarises all published grants made from 1983.

        It will be seen from the tables which have been incorporated in Hansard that significant grants have been made by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the ACTU. I spoke in the Senate during last session about the improper use of taxpayers' money to promote trade union activities and policies. Australia already has a large variety of aid organisations doing some excellent work. There is no reason why the ACTU through its arm Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA) should be receiving vast amounts of taxpayers' funds to promote its goals. In the introduction to the APHEDA annual report, Martin Ferguson states that APHEDA is the ACTU's overseas aid arm. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . using money donated by Australian trade unions and their members, it (APHEDA) is enabling them (people in developing countries) to lead productive lives . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us remember it is using money donated by the Australian trade unions and their members. There is no mention there by Mr Ferguson that of the $3.1m spent by APHEDA in 1990, 83 per cent came from the taxpayer. Cliff Dolan, Chairperson of APHEDA, in his statement in the APHEDA report, also fails to mention the huge contribution received from the taxpayer. Indeed, he says:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the money available for worker training now reaches over $3 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        He says that this is remarkable `especially considering the Government's decreased spending on overseas aid as a percentage of GDP'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has to be said that there is some irony here. Government spending on APHEDA has risen from $110,000 to over $2.4m in 1989-90, compared with the first year when the Hawke Government came into office. One has to continue through to the back of the APHEDA report before one finds those details.
       </para>
       <para>
        Grants have been made by APHEDA to organisations such as the African National Congress, the Commonwealth Trade Union Council, South Pacific and Oceania Council of Trade Unions, and community radio in New Caledonia. Senator Harradine's dollars are being given to those organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over $120,000 is spent by APHEDA on what is described as development education. Taxpayers will be surprised to learn that this money does not go to aid overseas countries to assist in the alleviation of poverty, but for `educating Australian workers about the fundamental causes of third world poverty and injustice as well as APHEDA's role in helping to change the situation'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps some of this money could be used to explain to Australian workers why they are now being thrown onto the dole queues and poverty as a result of the Government's recession-the recession, of course, we had to have. Some may think cynically that development education is just propaganda for APHEDA and the ACTU. I think they would be right. The report tells us that stories written by APHEDA's part time journalist in `all cases' have stressed that `APHEDA is the overseas aid agency of the ACTU. We believe this benefits the whole trade union movement'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is this type of statement which, naturally, will raise concerns. Money which is granted for overseas aid ends up helping to pay for a journalist in Australia whose work, among other things, has the effect of helping to promote the ACTU. How is it that money appropriated for overseas aid ends up promoting the ACTU? This is a matter to which the Auditor-General could turn his mind.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does the APHEDA development education material which is being given to Australian unionists stress the vital role that free enterprise and democracy play in alleviating poverty and injustice? What does Senator Crowley think? Well, if a recent summary of their views on Vietnam are any indication, as contained in the APHEDA report of June 1990, APHEDA's development education program seems grossly inadequate. Given our own appalling industrial relations system, many people will regard with wry amusement the fact that Australian aid is being used, according to Senator Evans's answer to my question, to promote the establishment of sound labour relations in other countries. Certainly, they could give instruction on how unions can extract from the Government vast sums of taxpayers' dollars.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is only one of a number of departments which make substantial grants to the ACTU. We have learnt, for example, that in 1990-91 alone, over $170,000 is being paid to the ACTU, among other things, to help with union amalgamations. How is this money spent? Is there proper accountability? Many of the unions which are amalgamating have large memberships and substantial resources. For example, $70,000 has been granted to assist the amalgamation of the Waterside Workers Federation and Australian Foremen Stevedores Association. Senator Collins would know those two unions very well. Is it too much to ask Senator Collins whether these two well-resourced unions could have found the money to assist in their own rationalisation. Why did the taxpayer have to come in? Why the taxpayer should be forced to fund a reform which the unions believe to be to their own benefit is beyond belief. In my view it is a disgraceful use of taxpayer funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ACTU has been able to obtain funds from other departments. For example, the Department of Employment, Education and Training provided $50,000 to the ACTU to employ a research officer to investigate the effects of award restructuring on women in the retail industry and the clerical occupations. It would be interesting to see that report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Community Services and Health has been a huge contributor to the ACTU, providing over $650,000 during the term of the Hawke Government, including a sum of $80,000 in this year alone. Grants paid include money for a national child-care coordinator and production of booklets and leaflets relating to the HIV-AIDS issue. Unlike union amalgamations and grants to dubious overseas organisations, these may well be worthy activities but, as I shall suggest later, they may well be matters which the ACTU itself should be funding rather than relying on taxpayers, particularly in view of the fact that the ACTU seems to have a lot of money to spend on other activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Primary Industries and Energy plans to make grants totalling $75,000 to look at alternatives to logging in National Estate forests. Again, it will be interesting to see how that money is actually spent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Alston has recently detailed a number of astonishing grants made recently by various government organisations, including the Department of Social Security, to sponsor an advertising campaign to boost union membership. Of the $135,000 provided by the Government for this ACTU campaign, some $45,000 came from the Department of Social Security jobs, education and training (JET) scheme-a training program designed to get sole parents back into the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        How can it possibly be justified that money appropriated by this Parliament to assist sole parents ends up with the ACTU to promote union membership? As with the grants paid to APHEDA, it seems to me that the Auditor-General should investigate to ensure that this is a proper use of moneys appropriated by the Parliament. There are two issues here, of course. Has the money which has been appropriated been appropriated in a way which, effectively, represents the aims of the Parliament in appropriating the money? The second issue is how this money is actually spent on the ground?
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two issues which I think this chamber should address itself to. First of all, it is clear that the trade union movement is not short of funds or assets. While the ACTU has been given over $11m of taxpayers' funds by the Hawke Government to carry out a variety of activities, some of which seem to have no particular relevance to the needs and interests of Australian workers, it apparently has funds available to purchase part of the Labor Party's headquarters in Canberra-John Curtin House.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, for example, in November that the ALP was selling one-third of its share in John Curtin House. True to the policy of the Hawke Government which has allowed Australia to run up massive debts, the ALP is apparently in debt to the tune of $7m. This contribution by the ACTU in purchasing one-third of John Curtin House will help pay back these huge debts. We do not know how much the ACTU will be paying for its one-third share. I do not know; it has not been reported. That could possibly be revealed by Senator Collins, who is at the table, at the end of this adjournment debate. In view of the money which has been granted to the ACTU, it would be most interesting. We know from its published accounts that the ACTU has general reserves in the order of $1.7m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, this purchase by the ACTU highlights the issue of propriety. It is apparent that the leadership of the ACTU is either too arrogant or too foolish to see the impossible position in which it has placed its organisation. The propriety I refer to is where, on the one hand, an organisation receives directly vast amounts of taxpayers' funds from the Labor Government for its activities and, on the other hand, is prepared to pay substantial amounts of money to the Labor Party either to assist in its re-election or to help fund its debts. On the one hand, the Labor Party giveth to the ACTU and, on the other hand, it receiveth. I can tell Senator Collins that there is an issue of propriety there.

       <para>
        Senator Parer was arguing that it was an abuse by the Government to use taxpayers' funds to influence lobby groups which, in turn, campaigned on behalf of the Labor Party. Martin Ferguson has already told us that the ACTU is part and parcel of the Government of Australia; it is not an independent lobby group. No-one in this Parliament knows how effectively all the taxpayers' money that has been given to the ACTU is being spent including, I suspect, some Ministers.
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of the very close links between the ACTU and the Government one would have thought that commonsense would have indicated that every action would be taken to ensure that not only are proprieties maintained, but also they are seen to be maintained. I believe, therefore, that no taxpayer funding should be given to the ACTU-none whatsoever. The ACTU is a huge organisation. How many members does it claim-three million? And it relies on $4m from the taxpayer to get it over the hurdle this year.

       <para>
        In Martin Ferguson's words, the ACTU is part and parcel of the Government. I do not argue the issue with the President of the ACTU. He is absolutely right. The ACTU receives millions of dollars from the Labor Government, it campaigns on behalf of the Labor Party and is considering purchasing Labor Party headquarters. I, therefore, argue that it is an intolerable use of taxpayers' funds for the Labor Government to fund the activities of its partner in government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Auditor-General should be asked to examine how these grants, given by the Labor Government to the ACTU, are being spent so that we can be assured and, indeed, even the Minister can be assured that the Labor Party is not indirectly funding its own political activities through government grants. That would make us all happy-just to have that assurance.

Let us not fool ourselves. The payments I have mentioned are not made in the public interest, they are made to promote the private interests of the Government's powerful friends and, where practical, promote the Government. This marriage between the ACTU and the Hawke Government is not a marriage made in heaven, it is a marriage made at the expense of the Australian people and at the expense of proper proprieties.

        The problem I have with Senator Kemp, smiling and graceful as he was when he said all of that, was that he actually drew that dreadful tactic from the bottom drawer called smear by innuendo. He seems to know better the motives of all those people covered by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the board of the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA). I do not know if he knows, but I am actually on the board of APHEDA. I was on the board of APHEDA originally as a more senior member at its inauguration, and have been in continuous service ever since. I take strenuous objection to the implications in Senator Kemp's speech of what I or the board members of APHEDA are doing, firstly, in even implying that we do not know what we are doing and, secondly, that we are misappropriating taxpayers' money.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Kemp's principal claim is that any tax dollars going to the ACTU are going in the wrong direction. That is a bold claim and totally indefensible. I object to it strenuously because he attaches to that implications of gross impropriety and wickedness on behalf of the ACTU. I would simply like to ask Senator Kemp whether he would care to defend at another time the amount of taxpayers' dollars that go to 1,001 organisations around this country, even those that enjoy tax concessions when people make contributions to charitable organisations, even those that are tax concessions through what are called legitimate claims by business against the cost of their exercise in industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tax dollars are going into any number of organisations in this country. I blush not at all that this Government properly provides tax assistance, tax dollars, in a variety of ways to assist the work done by the ACTU. If Senator Kemp wants to suggest that it is unreasonable of the ACTU to be promoting unionism and not free enterprise, I would ask him whether private enterprise in this country promotes unionism while it is also promoting its own private enterprise. It is a farce and I am not prepared to spend too much time tonight debating farce. Senator Kemp's claim, through its implications and its innuendos, suggests gross impropriety by the ACTU and by the board of APHEDA. I simply mention those points to suggest that Senator Kemp's arguments would not hold up in grade 3 and they certainly do not hold up in this place. That is a matter of logic. Smiling as he goes does not make Senator Kemp's claims any more persuasive but just more palatable if the television camera is on him at the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the board of APHEDA, the remarkable thing about that organisation, and the reason that it has enjoyed assistance through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) for its work, is that it is distinguished in kind in the work it has done in overseas places, many of which Senator Kemp presumably could list. Unlike Senator Kemp, I could not list them all without referring to a piece of paper.

         —No, I do not hold all that detail in my memory, but I do know where to find it. The distinguishing feature of the ACTU, through its aid arm APHEDA, is that unionists teach their skills to people in other countries, particularly Third World countries, so that they can use them in their own countries. We do not take bricks and mortar; we do not take equipment; almost invariably, we teach the skills of the work force of Australia, offered in considerable generosity through the services of APHEDA, to members in the recipient organisations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That is the distinguishing character of APHEDA that needs to be acknowledged as well as, I am happy to say, the generosity of the ACTU through its great contribution to the administration of APHEDA. The initiatives for this came from the recognition of the work of the union movement, particularly that of Norway and Sweden, in the Middle East. The recognition of that type of foreign aid, if you like, was to distinguish it quite considerably from other aid organisations that are more in the business of providing bricks and mortar, food, clothing, equipment and so on. This organisation has always had as its priority to take the skills of a variety of qualified workers in this country-teachers, nurses, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians and so on-to countries where they are very welcomed and which have been able to cheerfully seek that service from us.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a matter of record that the AIDAB section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been very pleased to offer money but, as is the case with all of the recipients of AIDAB's concessions and grants, APHEDA meets strict requirements and its funding is no different from any other taxpayers' dollars going to any other aid organisations. I sincerely hope that Senator Kemp does not want to dismiss APHEDA and its claim on the tax generosity of the people in this country as apart from any other aid organisation that receives tax dollars. Senator Kemp's suggested proposal is outrageous. I find it outrageous and also utterly disappointing, showing, as it does, his complete lack of understanding of what distinguishes APHEDA and also his lack of understanding of the generosity of the ACTU in assisting it.
       </para>
       <para>
        To this point very few people in this country have understood development education properly. Were Senator Kemp to inquire, he would know that the campaign for funding through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for development education in this country has come from-if not all-almost all aid organisations in this country. It is not just APHEDA that has money for development education; it is any number of aid organisations. If Senator Kemp wishes to make a wickedness out of this, he must sheet this claim home to World Vision of Australia, to Community Aid Abroad, and to the other very reputable aid organisations operating out of this country. Development education is something that is poorly understood and it is quite clear that we need to have funding to promote it and to extend the understanding in Australia of what development education is about.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another point that Senator Kemp made in his grab bag of abuse by innuendo was to suggest that the ACTU should not have any involvement with taxpayers' dollars through the jobs, education and training scheme. Who does Senator Kemp suppose has been one of the large suppliers of training and education, employment opportunities and assistance in the training in this country? It took ages to negotiate with the trade union movement the proper way of providing training assistance so as to guarantee that the rights won by workers were not eroded. It would be very easy to slip in a training program to provide work at very reduced pay. That might even be something that people would eventually come to agree with. But the union movement said, `If you want to do that, you must talk to us so that we can guarantee the rights of those trainees to adequate training and to an adequate employment opportunity in a way that guarantees the rights of workers to award wages and conditions'. We cannot introduce a scheme that just undercuts everything for which the union movement has fought for a century. I believe we could say a century. I think that the Labor movement in this country is formally 100 years old. My colleagues might confirm that. I am not quite sure of the date of its inception; I think it is about that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for the suggestion that the trade union movement should not have connections with government, the trade union movement actually gets its parliamentary representation through the Australian Labor Party. I make no apologies for that. I do not think that any unionists would either. It is precisely because, without their own representation, their rights and conditions were not adequately covered. Senator Kemp should check out the late nineteenth century; he should check out anything he likes about the history of how workers were denied their rights and access until a union movement was established and fought for and guaranteed those rights, which were never properly exercised until we had parliamentary representation for those workers' representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        With these comments, I simply serve notice that I will take Senator Kemp's speech and read it very closely in case more points of fact should be made to this Senate about the organisation APHEDA. I am very disappointed to have to take issue with Senator Kemp in this place so early in his parliamentary career when he has succumbed to the temptation of arguing by innuendo instead of sticking to facts. He did not resist the temptation to attribute motive or draw his own conclusions from those facts. He argued his points only by ascribing evil motive or poor intent to the ACTU, to the union movement, to those thousands of workers and aid workers in this country. It is a disgrace and a shame-a blot on Senator Kemp's character. As I say, I will examine his speech very closely. If anything further needs to be said about it, he can be assured that he will be hearing it.

         —I rise to comment briefly on the preparedness of the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to participate in the Family Law Act inquiry which originally, on a motion by Senator Brownhill, was planned as a joint select committee. Like Senator Brownhill's welcome, mine is not entirely unqualified. I believe that the Federal Attorney-General should be requested to ensure that no delays occur.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The terms of reference have now been agreed upon between the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for the earlier proposed Senate inquiry. I wish to put on record that we will not allow the Attorney-General to delay proceedings or to water down the terms of reference. It is entirely urgent that the terms of reference are drawn wide enough to cover all the concerns that have been expressed by people who have gone through a very traumatic stage in their lives. In particular, I wish to put on record the matters I have been able to negotiate with Senator Brownhill to ensure that some of these concerns are covered.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the concerns is the inclusion of previous reports by the Family Law Council, the Law Reform Commission and the Australian Institute of Family Studies. It is important that we do not reinvent the wheel but that we make use of the quite extensive reports and inquiries that have been carried out recently and which are germane to the matters which will be before the committee of inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, it is important to look at the current procedures and staffing of the Family Court of Australia as well as the legal costs imposed on parties in proceedings before the court. These are not matters that are, in their entirety, covered by legislation, but they are matters which are of extreme importance to people who have to deal with the Family Court and they must be handled by that committee. In addition, it is essential to examine the extent to which the adversarial procedures of our legal system are used by the Family Court and lawyers-perhaps more so by lawyers than by the court itself-to create and intensify conflict. This may well be a jurisdiction where the adversarial system should be modified in the interests of the parties that appear before the Court.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, and most importantly, I believe the inquiry must address alternative means of dispute resolution and must address the funding for mediation, counselling and legal aid services. I believe it is important that these matters, having gone that far, are included in the terms of reference so they can be addressed by the committee of inquiry to be established. I trust that the Attorney-General will accept these and other matters that are currently part of the draft terms of reference and look forward to the establishment of the committee of inquiry at a very early date, within weeks.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I am advised that hospital morbidity data collected by the Australian Institute of Health (from all States and Territories except Tasmania) indicate about 40 cases of lead poisoning result in admission to a public hospital each year. On the basis of this data, lead poisoning could not be considered a major cause of clinical morbidity in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Low level chronic exposure, particularly of children, continues to be an issue of public health concern. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;RC) has determined that blood-lead levels in excess of 25 micrograms per decilitre (25ug/dL) are a matter of public health concern. Recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of children (8% of children in the 1990 Wollongong Lead Study and 7% in the 1983 `Study of Lead Exposure, Lead Absorption and Lead Toxicity in Children of Port Pirie') have blood levels above this recommended level of concern. The significance of this is now the subject of a long-term study of environmental lead exposure and early childhood development in Port Pirie, funded by the NH&amp;RC and scheduled for completion in late 1991. Early results from this, and comparable studies overseas, indicate that marginal impairments of neuropsychological development can result from the sorts of environmental exposure levels that can occur within industrially exposed and densely settled urban populations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission has published a discussion paper on the control and safe use of lead at work (July 1990) which included detail of a survey sample of occupationally exposed workers. This sample included 32 females. Blood-lead tests of 3137 of these workers, in June 1988, indicated a range of concentrations, with some 69.5% of subjects having blood-lead levels greater than 29ug/dL.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) To diagnose lead poisoning, a full history and examination for clinical signs (for example, neurological symptoms) would initially be undertaken in a patient suspected of exposure to lead. Diagnostic tests are described in standard medical reference texts, such as ``Medical Toxicology-Diagnosis and Treatment of Human Poisoning'' (Ellenhorn and Barceloux, 1988).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Lead poisoning may result from occupational, non-occupational, environmental or intentional exposure. Common causes of lead poisoning are occupational and environmental exposure during lead smelting operations and industrial processes such as battery manufacture; eating from unfired or lead-glazed pottery; ingestion of lead-containing paint flakes and lead sinkers; motor vehicle exhausts from leaded petrol; and sniffing leaded petrol.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) In lead exposed workers, the treatment is removal from exposure and keeping the patient active. In cases where blood-lead levels are considered clinically important, treatment may include the removal of lead from the body by chelation therapy. This type of therapy is more common in cases of acute poisoning in children.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Medicare benefits are payable for services listed in the Medicare Benefits Schedule where rendered by qualified medical practitioners. While there is no specific item in the Schedule to cover treatment of lead poisoning, services rendered in conjunction with treatment, that is attendances at which treatment is given, pathology services, etc, would attract benefits.

       (f) The surveys were omnibus or shared cost surveys, and the Centre only provided a copy of that part of the questionnaire which contained the questions OGIA commissioned. The Centre did not provide a full copy of the questionnaire as it contained questions commissioned by other organisations, and these are considered confidential to the organisations placing them.

       The Centre is a member of the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR) and is bound by that organisation's code of professional behaviour. The department relied on the professionalism and integrity of the Centre's staff to ensure there was no conflict of interest or subject bias between the subjects addressed in the questionnaire.

       (g) Yes, as it was an omnibus or shared cost survey. It is also likely that some questions were asked not related to the subject to provide demographic data (such as age, marital status, income, education etc) to ensure that samples were statistically representative.

       (k) The results of the first survey were used to help design the advertising campaign on the Accord. The other two surveys were used to monitor the effect of the advertising campaign on the community's level of awareness and understanding of the Accord. They were also used to assess whether further awareness raising activities were needed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (l) The Office of Government Information and Advertising decided to undertake the market research to help design the advertising campaign for the Accord and then to monitor the community's level of awareness of the Accord both during and after the campaign.

Templine simply refers CES clients who are looking for temporary employment to departments, agencies and other employers: these bodies become the employers of those temporary staff and Templine has no ongoing relationship with such staff until the work assignment is complete and the jobseeker indicates to Templine that he/she wants further work.

        —The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1)-(4) The `Estraderm' patch, that is designed to be applied to the skin and deliver a predetermined dose of oestradiol, the most active of the naturally occurring female oestrogen hormones, has been considered by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) on seven occasions since December 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       The sponsor company, Ciba-Geigy, has so far been unable to answer ADEC's concerns about the safety and efficacy of the product. A recent resubmission from the company has been evaluated but will not be considered by ADEC until February as the company has requested more time for the pre-ADEC consultation process.
      </para>
      <para>
       ADEC has not asked for additional clinical trials above and beyond these requested by the countries which have approved a version of the drug for use.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, as the patches used in clinical studies and marketed in certain countries, such as the USA, are not clearly the same as those proposed for Australian women, ADEC has insisted that the company unequivocally identify which trials have used the patch for use in Australia. Variations in drug delivery associated with the different delivery systems may result in an altered safety and efficacy profile.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the use of oestrogen can be associated with cancer of the womb and other severe adverse reactions, establishing the safety of the Australian drug delivery system is essential.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, if a woman is in serious need of hormone replacement therapy and is unable to tolerate the other alternate forms of oestrogen available on the Australian market (oral tablets, subdermal (under the skin) implants, injections and topical creams and gels for vaginal use), then permission for supply of patches can be given under the department's Individual Patient Usage (IPU) Scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       The only other way an unmarketed product, for which there are alternate available forms, can be used in Australia is in the context of a clinical trial. However, the sponsor company has not expressed an interest in this option.
      </para>
      <para>
       A patient would not be allowed to personally import the product without IPU approval.

       (1) (b) (2) and (3) Clients are paid from the next available payday after a decision has been made to grant payment. This means that the time taken to pay a client after the Department has made a decision to grant payment can be up to 21 days, in the case of a pension or allowance payment (allowing for a processing cutoff), but on average is less than 14 days. Payments are made within 2 days in the case of benefits (benefits are paid on a daily basis in contrast to a fortnightly cycle for pensions and allowances). In summary, once a decision is taken to grant a payment the payment is made at the first payday as described above. The number of late payments, in the sense that they are outside that timeframe, is negligible. This applies to continuing payments as well. There are many factors which influence the timing of decisions to grant claims. Sometimes the client does not furnish full details when submitting a claim. In other cases the Department has to seek information from accountants, doctors and specialists and other State and federal departments before making a decision on a client's eligibility. Generally speaking these factors are outside the Department's direct control.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) Of the 68 recommendations 56 have been implemented. Both before and after the JPCPA inquiry a number of measures were implemented by the Department of Defence to improve the overall level of efficiency, effectiveness and resources management in the area of project management. In particular the creation of the Capital Procurement Organisation in June 1984 (subsequently re-organised into the Acquisition and Logistics Organisation in 1989) brought together into one organisation, those Departmental elements responsible for the bringing into service of approved major capital equipment and those elements responsible for financial programming and budgeting, procurement policy and procedures, and the industry policy and involvement program. The implementation of these measures has resulted in:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) more efficient project management and cost control measures being exercised over the overall major capital equipment program;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) the establishment of clearer lines of responsibility, in particular the devolution of greater authority and independence to the Assistant Chiefs of Staff-Materiel and to project managers, to give more autonomy in the management of individual capital equipment projects;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) the development and promulgation of a Capital Equipment Procurement Manual which provides procedural guidance on Government and Defence policies, including procurement and industry policy, financial management statutory requirements, procurement and contracting matters; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) enhanced training and professionalism in Defence project management.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Three (3) recommendations (Nos 8, 15 and 60) were accepted in varying degree, but not fully implemented. The current situation against each of these recommendations is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Recommendation 8: Major Equipment Submissions are considered for project approval following extended internal Defence review. The key issues of capability, cost, risk, timing, likely industry involvement and support arrangements are considered in this process. However, it is not always appropriate to seek from industry tender quality costs in advance of Government approval. For the same reason, complete equipment support requirements will not always be available at that stage. These matters are refined further before contract award. An endorsed Equipment Acquisition Strategy (EAS) is required, however, prior to seeking project approval.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Recommendation 15: While no specific study as proposed has been carried out, the use of computerised project management tools has been extended considerably in Defence in recent years, eg. in project management techniques and packages for networking and resource management. Some of this has involved computer simulation modelling.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Recommendation 60: This matter is continually under review with the aim of reducing reliance on overseas courses as Australian course options become available. The effectiveness of the courses at Australian tertiary institutions such as USQ and ADFA is being examined. Some overseas post graduate courses that are unavailable in Australia are still required (eg advanced Integrated Logistic Support course elements such as Logistic Engineering). Some experience of overseas management systems and practices is achieved through overseas courses and personnel exchange programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The remaining nine (9) recommendations (Nos. 2, 4a, 7, 11, 27, 35, 61, 67 &amp;68) of JPCPA Report 243 have not been accepted or are not relevant. The reasons why these recommendations were not accepted or are not relevant are as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Recommendation 2: Staff Targets no longer exist. They have been replaced by Defence Force Capability Proposals under new arrangements which give sponsorship of proposals to HQADF. These proposals describe the function and desired performance of an equipment or system as a basis for determining, among other things, estimates of costs. The proposals are then developed in greater detail as Major Equipment Submissions for review by the Force Structure Policy and Programming Committee; these submissions must address project cost and through-life costs in detail.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Recommendation 4a: Close relations are maintained between the A&amp; Organisation and the project sponsor, but placing sole responsibility for progress of a project through the FYDP with A&amp; staff would put unacceptable emphasis on procurement aspects at the expense of force development and force structure aspects.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Recommendation 7: Staff Objectives, Staff Targets and Staff Requirements no longer exist as such in the development process for Capability Proposals. However, Project Definition Studies themselves now form an important element in the development and refinement of many capability proposals.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) Recommendation 11: A costing section was established within the Capital Procurement Organisation (CPO) in 1987, but following the reorganisation of the CPO in 1988, its functions were subsumed in the work of a section with broader responsibilities. Because of the rate at which new technology and capabilities are incorporated in military equipment, the resources required to maintain reliable equipment cost databases are extensive and it is now considered preferable to obtain information on project costs from contractors, project definition studies and overseas Defence organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) Recommendation 27: It is not practicable for contracts to list all conceivable events which might cause contract delay outside the contractor's control. The current pro-forma contract in DEFPUR101 is considered to provide an effective but necessarily flexible clause.
      </para>
      <para>
       (vi) Recommendation 35: Compliance with appropriate Australian standards is expected of local suppliers of items of major equipment but complete insistence may in some areas involve unjustifiable costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (vii) Recommendation 61: The PSC has devolved career development responsibilities to individual departments and it was not relevant to pursue this with them. Development of civilian project management personnel is facilitated by mobility of staff between core and project branches thereby widening the relevant experience of officers. The project pool is a key mechanism in this regard. Additionally, a new system (CIVTRACK) is being piloted to identify training and career development needs for staff including project management staff. Individual branches are also developing staff training plans. The recently instituted Departmental senior officer performance appraisal process will include discussion and guidance on the individual's career development in the project management career path; it will also provide an avenue for ensuring that A&amp; managers give priority to training and development of their staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       (viii) Recommendation 67: The JPCPA considerations were conducted prior to the implementation of Program Management and Budgeting (PMB). In keeping with the criteria of PMB and the emphasis on reporting achievements against clearly defined goals and objectives, the information made available to the Parliament and public is now more comprehensive than in 1984-86. In such reports there has been a significant increase in the amount of information made available through Program Statements and the Defence Report. Whilst it is possible to provide information against specific requests, the provision of the full range of information sought against all projects would have significant resource implications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ix) Recommendation 68: Audit involvement in Defence major projects has been substantially increased since the JPCPA review. The Department's Management Audit Branch has increased resources and priorities allocated to its examination of major projects. A separate Directorate within the Branch is now responsible for acquisition and logistics matters with particular emphasis on capital acquisition. Outside consultants have assisted with the development of new audit methodologies in the capital acquisition area and a new audit manual reflecting contemporary audit practices in relation to large capital acquisition projects has been produced. Copies of this manual have been provided to the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). The Department meets regularly with the Australian National Audit Office to review audit activities generally and the Management Audit Branch's annual report to the Defence Audit Policy Committee is provided to the ANAO. These initiatives have substantially improved the oversight of major projects both within Defence and the ANAO.

      <para>
       Hospital care for entitled veterans and war widows is provided through the repatriation hospitals and by agreement with other institutions-public and private. Health care at the expense of the DVA for the general public is available only at repatriation hospitals, in certain circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       Repatriation General Hospitals are modern acute care hospitals. Maintenance of medical and related skills requires their staff to have access to variety of patient mix and medical conditions. Since 1971 therefore, it has been recognised by successive Commonwealth Governments that the continuing viability of repatriation hospitals requires a proportion of community patients to be treated.
      </para>
      <para>
       The budgetary allocations to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for hospital treatment recognise this reality and are therefore not intended for exclusive benefit of veterans.
      </para>
      <para>
       As noted in the Budget papers, the allocations are made for payment to the relevant repatriation hospital operations trust accounts. The purpose of the trust accounts, one of which exists for each hospital, is simply to fund that hospital's operations. It follows therefore that the allocations are intended to cover all activity in which the hospitals can legitimately engage.
      </para>
      <para>
       The authority under which the Repatriation Commission operates the hospitals is contained in section 89 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. That section, in conjunction with Sections 85 and 86, also establishes their primary responsibility as the treatment of eligible veterans and eligible dependants.

       (1) Approximately 6,400 Australian servicemen were involved in the British Atomic Tests Program in Australia. Separate figures on the mortality amongst ex-servicemen who participated in the Tests Program are not recorded. The only figures available are those obtained in 1982/83 for the Commonwealth Department of Health following a survey of the health of Australian personnel who took part in the Tests Program. The Report of that study, entitled ``Health of Atomic Test Personnel'' records that at the end of 1982 five hundred and thirty-four ex-servicemen were confirmed dead, although the cause of death is not recorded.

       (2) (a) 57 common law actions have been initiated against the Commonwealth by ex-servicemen or the widows of ex-servicemen. 269 claims for compensation have been lodged by ex-servicemen or the widows of ex-servicemen under the Commonwealth's compensation legislation. Q 358(3) deals with those ex-servicemen who qualify for compensation under a Special Administrative Scheme for Test participants who have multiple myeloma or leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) as well as the dependants of such participants.
      </para>

       (b) One common law action has been successful, the jury awarding the plaintiff $679,500 in damages. Under the provisions of the Commonwealth's compensation legislation, 26 claims have been successful. Q 358(3) deals with those ex-servicemen who have qualified for compensation under a Special Administrative Scheme for Test participants who have multiple myeloma or leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) as well as the dependants of such participants.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Of the 57 common law actions initiated against the Commonwealth by ex-servicemen, 54 are still pending (two actions have been withdrawn and the other action is referred to in paragraph (b) above). Under the Commonwealth's compensation legislation, one claim is yet to be determined. Q 358(3) deals with those claims by ex-servicemen who have applied for compensation under a Special Administrative Scheme for Test participants who have multiple myeloma or leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) as well as the dependants of such participants.

       (3) Any ex-servicemen who participated in the Atomic Tests Program who have multiple myeloma or leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) as well as the dependants of such participants are eligible to apply for compensation under a Special Administrative Scheme which was established by the Government in September 1989. Each case is considered on its merits.
      </para>
      <para>
       To date twelve claims by ex-servicemen or the dependants of ex-servicemen have been considered under this Special Administrative Scheme. Of these twelve claims, four have been successful and four have been disallowed.

       (1) While I am aware that direct mail advertising originating from North America is being sent to Australian consumers, I do not know the volume of such mail. Australian legislation, in general, does not prohibit the solicitation of business through the mail. It is not clear that any such prohibition would be practical or provide any benefit to consumers. If Australian businesses are permitted to solicit by direct mail advertising, it would be incongruous to prohibit overseas businesses doing likewise.

       (2) The provisions in Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 protect consumers from a wide range of unfair practices, including misleading or deceptive conduct, and imply conditions and warranties into contracts for the supply of goods or services by a corporation (and in some cases by an individual) to a consumer. Whether this protection is available to consumers purchasing through mail order from an overseas company will depend upon the particular circumstances of the transaction and the application of the rules for resolving conflicts of laws which arise in international transactions. If the seller has no place of business in Australia, however, any remedy granted by the courts may be difficult to enforce. The country in which the seller has its place of business may also confer rights upon consumers.

        —The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) For the purposes of the Training Guarantee Scheme, a training program is defined as eligible training (by Section 27 (1) of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990) if:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the program is a structured training program; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) the sole or principal object of the program is to develop, maintain or improve employment related skills of employees or other persons.
      </para>
      <para>
       As with Service training programs in general, practically all Reserve training programs meet these criteria. Service training programs are structured through the utilisation of a systematic approach to both the design and conduct of the training, including as essential features:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) formalized employment related training objectives,
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) training material and teaching methods specifically developed to help achieve these objectives, and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) assessment methods which ensure that the students have achieved these objectives.
      </para>
      <para>
       The design and approval of these training programs is undertaken by personnel who are appropriately qualified through having attended the necessary training development, management and administration courses.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force believe that the guidelines provided by the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 and the Australian Taxation Office in the booklet `The Training Guarantee-Your Questions Answered' are sufficient at this time. Neither the Department of Defence nor the Australian Defence Force intends producing additional guidelines at this stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The main objective of Reserve training, as it is with the majority of training programs in the regular forces, is to prepare personnel as effective members of a Service team. Reservists will normally spend the majority of their Reserve training obligations in a structured training program developing, maintaining or improving skills specific to their military employment. Their training therefore meets the eligibility criteria under the Training Guarantee legislation. The need for Reservists to undertake some of their training at night or on weekends is not a consideration as regards the eligibility of the training program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Training Guarantee obligation is for employers to spend 1% of their total payroll amount on eligible training in each financial year. Reserve personnel spend the majority of their Reserve time in developing, maintaining or improving skills specific to their military employment by means of structured training programs. Expenditure on this training substantially exceeds the Training Guarantee obligation. As no shortfall will occur in respect of the 1% obligation under the legislation, no charge will be payable.

      <para>
       (1) No formal examination of this matter has been conducted as there are no easily accessible sources of information on the number of CB transmitters sold.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Bureau of Statistics do keep figures relating to importation of CB equipment but these are based on excise revenue. The generic nature of the classification and the lack of knowledge about the number of units makes it impossible to accurately estimate the number of CB transmitters held by operators.
      </para>
      <para>
       For all of these reasons the Department has not been able to make comparisons on other than statistical samples from its own regulatory campaigns. These statistics indicate that, for the sample areas, between 40 to 60 percent of CB transmitters were found to be unlicensed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because of the small statistical sample and differing demography, the result would be very unreliable if these figures were projected to the national level.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) If the number of unlicensed CBs was as high as is implied by the information available to the Department, the amount of licence tax evaded annually, based on the 1990 licence tax level and September quarterly licence statistics, is between 4.0 and 10.0 million dollars.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Stricter enforcement of licensing requirements will entail significant costs for increased personnel, motor vehicles, technical equipment and accommodation in remote locations. Increased court costs from a greater number of court actions could also be anticipated for the more difficult cases, but this may be offset to some extent by an increase in the issue of ``on-the-spot'' fines as an alternative enforcement approach.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, firm figures on these costs are difficult to quantify and would depend on the level of enforcement activity pursued.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes, providing a reasonable balance was maintained between staff engaged in the activity and the results flowing from the action. However, it needs to be recognised that no level of resources could ever completely eradicate the practice.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Repairs to aircraft large bonded panels in the past have been undertaken overseas because commercial companies in Australia have concentrated on production rather than on repair work. RAAF has undertaken repairs of small panels to the limit of an existing small autoclave; this RAAF capability is required for the possible repair of battle damaged aircraft operating from forward bases. The autoclave acquisition was justified on the basis of efficiency gains to be made by performing in Australia repairs which are currently performed overseas.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Both ASTA and Hawker de Havilland have facilities for this type of work but are set up for large scale manufacture rather than low volume repair. Recently ASTA set up its Military business unit which will have installed a large autoclave by April 1991 and aims to provide a repair capability for aircraft bonded panels. Therefore action on the RFT has been suspended pending an assessment of ASTA Military's capability to effectively and efficiently perform bonded panel repairs. An autoclave is only one element of that capability.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Civilian capacity is continually assessed. In 1988/89 the repair of large bonded panels was trialled unsuccessfully at ASTA's Fishermen's Bend facility. This inability of Australian industry to meet RAAF requirements led to the issuing of the RFT.
      </para>

       (4) RAAF possesses skills associated with repair of bonded panels including autoclave operations. These skills are considered fundamental to the RAAF's capability to perform battle damage repair on modern aircraft. No additional employment of personnel was proposed as part of this minor project.

        —The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Commonwealth's environmental guidelines for new bleached eucalypt kraft (BEK) pulp mills were released on 12 December 1989 as part of the Government's Pulp and Paper Industry Package. The guidelines specify emission limits based on the best available technology economically achievable (BATEA) and requirements for solid waste disposal, site suitability criteria and baseline studies and monitoring.
      </para>
      <para>
       The objectives of the guidelines are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) to ensure protection of the environment from emissions generated by future BEK pulp mills; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) to clarify for State/Territory government agencies, industry and potential investors, the minimum environmental requirements of the Commonwealth for any new BEK pulp mill.
      </para>
      <para>
       In pursuit of these objectives, the Commonwealth is seeking to negotiate with the States/Territories, which will have responsibility for licensing and regulating any new BEK pulp mill, agreements on procedures for environmental impact assessment (EIA), baseline studies, monitoring programs, and regulatory action during mill commissioning and operation. Negotiations are in progress at officer level with Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The guidelines will normally be subject to a 5-yearly review, to take account of technological improvements and new knowledge on environmental impact, using procedures the same as, or similar to, those used to develop the original set of guidelines.
      </para>
      <para>
       The review could be brought forward if particular environmental concerns have arisen, major new developments in BATEA have occurred, or a major new mill was about to be considered close to a scheduled review date.
      </para>
      <para>
       Currently, the Government is not aware of any of the conditions for a review being met. While we are aware that there is work being conducted towards further reduction of organochlorine emissions and that there have been some promising developments, we are not aware of any mill which has sufficient operational experience with any new or improved technologies to give us the data that would be required to develop, for instance, a new limit on annual average absorbable organic halide (AOX) emissions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth recognises that the States may require more stringent environmental controls than those embodied in the guidelines. In the event that a State were considering tighter limits for specific emissions, the Commonwealth would be willing to assist in their formulation.
      </para>
      <para>
       While the guidelines do not specify the technologies to be applied in a mill, they do set requirements based on the concept of BATEA; that is, technology installed and operating commercially in a similar mill elsewhere. The Commonwealth will not require a mill to incorporate unproven technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       The guidelines do not replace existing Commonwealth and State/Territory EIA processes, which would consider a wider range of environmental impacts than those included in the guidelines.

       (3) There are no outstanding matters in relation to acquittance of CDEP grants prior to 1989-90. All but 12 participating communities have satisfied full acquittal requirements in respect of the 1989/90 financial year. The audited financial statements of Alpurrurulam and Tjuwanpa were received late. Audited financial statements are still outstanding from Apatula, Galiwinku, Milikapiti, Ntaria, Pine Creek, Pularumpi, Waanyi Garawa, Willowra, Yirrkala Dhanbul and Yuelamu.

       The Barunga CDEP incurred a qualified audit due to lack of documentation in respect of payments for the period July/August 1989. In addition, comment was made on the lack of documentation for wages payments for the project and inadequate insurance cover for motor vehicles and plant and equipment.

       A cash payment of $319.96 could not be substantiated with a receipt. The balance of the community levy money ($100.04) had been removed from a safe and there was no trail as to where it had been banked, or spent.

       1989-90 Audit Report: Non-current assets were depreciated in these financial statements which is a departure from an Accounting Standard issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
      </para>
      <para>
       Auditors were unable to locate invoices or other documentation to support the majority of payments other than wages. They were therefore `` . . . unable to express an opinion whether the financial statements state fairly the expenditure for the year or the liabilities at 30 June 1990''.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since then, a new CDEP co-ordinator has been appointed and there has been an improvement in meeting ATSIC financial and reporting requirements. The Audit findings have been addressed and systems will be developed to avoid a recurrence.

       All audit reports are qualified in some way. In general the level of management and accounting expertise available on communities is of such a standard that it is difficult for Auditors to follow the flow of accounts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Auditors do not consider it cost-effective for them to make complete checks. This is particularly true of outstation work records. It is the practice of Auditors to qualify the accounts to provide protection for themselves as professionals.

      <para>
       The Commission acknowledges the importance of community development plans. Work has commenced on developing a community planning program. In the meantime, both the Commission and the Department of Employment, Education and Training are examining options for providing assistance to communities in the preparation of community development plans.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under new administrative arrangements for CDEP, communities will have to provide a CDEP works program when making applications for CDEP grant funds. The works program will comprise a list of projects that the community sees as important to its social, cultural, recreational and economic development.
      </para>
      <para>
       Communities are being encouraged to develop specific CDEP plans and/or community development plans. The CDEP works program would be an integral part of either of these plans.
      </para>
      <para>
       ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
      </para>
      <para>
       All CDEP grants are assessed by the Commission on the annual ``Grant Assessment Form'' which is completed by Regional Officers as part of the annual draft estimates documentation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to the annual grant assessment all CDEP projects are to be fully reviewed on a three year cycle commencing in 1991/92. It is envisaged that these reviews will be undertaken by officers from the Commission and the Departments of Employment, Education and Training and Social Security.
      </para>
      <para>
       PRIORITY SETTING
      </para>

       Under new administrative arrangements priorities for the allocation of CDEP Oncost and Support funds will be determined by Regional Managers in consultation with Regional Councils and CDEP communities and organisations.

       INACCURATE PAYMENTS
      </para>
      <para>
       It is acknowledged that some communities do not always submit fortnightly variation schedules. However, while this can cause short term inaccuracies, community entitlements are adjusted when subsequent schedules are received.
      </para>
      <para>
       While delays occur between the Commission and DSS this does not result in over or under payments by ATSIC, as any adjustments necessary (after DSS checking) are made in subsequent quarters.
      </para>
      <para>
       The lack of sanctions under the standard grant offer has been corrected by additional mandatory special conditions for CDEP.
      </para>
      <para>
       The administrative changes to the CDEP system to take effect from 1 April 1991 have been designed to simplify the calculation of communities' entitlements and should reduce the possibility of inaccuracies.
      </para>
      <para>
       MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING TRAINING
      </para>
      <para>
       The lack of qualified Aboriginal people has been a problem for DAA/ATSIC and communities alike. Training initiatives have been taken by DAA/ATSIC and the Department of Employment, Education and Training to address this issue.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a part of new administrative arrangements for CDEP, a Training Needs Schedule and a training program to meet these needs for each CDEP is required. Under the Department of Employment, Education and Training (Training for Aboriginals Program) funding may be made available for communities to engage a consultant, where appropriate, to prepare training needs analyses and/or training schedules for project participants.
      </para>
      <para>
       ENTITLEMENTS, ALLOWANCES AND AWARD PAYMENTS
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the ANAO audits of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were conducted there has been a significant improvement in the take up rate of the Family Allowance Supplement by CDEP participants. The Department of Social Security is promoting this allowance through its Aboriginal Liaison Officers and Community Agents.
      </para>
      <para>
       While ATSIC encourages the payment of wages at award rates, the setting of pay rates is left to the discretion of community councils and organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Award coverage for CDEP communities is a complex issue as the nature of the work generally is only part-time. The Commission is currently in the process of contracting a consultant to undertake research into industrial relations issues associated with CDEPs including the question of award coverage.

       <para in-line="1">
        —The Minister for Finance has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) and (b) The Minister for Finance's superannuation responsibilities are confined to the superannuation arrangements for the Commonwealth's civilian employees.
      </para>
      <para>
       Accordingly, this answer is restricted to the current superannuation arrangements for Commonwealth public servants. Employees of Commonwealth agencies with their own schemes, for example the Government Business Enterprises, are covered by arrangements very similar to those in the private sector and are taxed accordingly. The taxation of superannuation benefits in the hands of the recipients is taken to be outside the scope of the question.
      </para>
      <para>
       Commonwealth public servants could have their superannuation provided under one of the following arrangements:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) established by the Superannuation Act 1976; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) the Public Sector Superannuation (PSS) scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 under which:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) employers are required to pay continuing contributions on behalf of their employees to a superannuation fund on every pay period commencing 1 July 1990; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) those employees whose current weekly earning is less than $110.00 per week or whose employment contract is not exceeding three months, are provided with a cash benefit equivalent to the employer contributions that would have been paid to a superannuation fund had this provision not been in place; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) a safety net is provided by which employees who do not receive their productivity benefit through any of the other superannuation arrangements can be paid a benefit; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) special arrangements for senior fixed-term employees (for example, continuing membership of a previous superannuation scheme during their Commonwealth employment).
      </para>
      <para>
       Interim Arrangement for Productivity Benefit
      </para>
      <para>
       For the period 1 January 1988 to 30 June 1990, the productivity benefit was provided for all employees now covered by the first three of the four categories described above under the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988. It was administered by employers and was not funded until the employee exited from Commonwealth employment and as such not taxed until received by the beneficiary.
      </para>
      <para>
       The benefit provided under the interim arrangement approximated an accumulation of the productivity contributions with interest at the long-term bond rate, without any deduction for administrative expenses.
      </para>
      <para>
       The CSS and PSS
      </para>
      <para>
       The CSS and PSS are the two major schemes for Commonwealth public servants. They require members to contribute and the employer cost of providing benefits is greater than the 3 per cent productivity benefit. From 1 July 1990, the schemes incorporate the 3 per cent benefit for public servants in their benefit structure, including the amount of the unfunded benefit at 30 June 1990 under the interim arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       From 1 July 1990, employers have been required to pay the 3 per cent productivity contribution into the superannuation funds established for the CSS and PSS. No administrative fee is deducted from the productivity contribution itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       The productivity contributions form part of the assessable income of each fund, as do earnings arising from the investment of the productivity and member contributions. After allowable deductions (which would include the administrative and other costs associated with the investment of the fund), the taxable income of the fund is subject to tax at the rate of 15 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       Income tax is deducted from the net earnings of each superannuation fund prior to determining the amount available for distribution to individual members' accounts. The amount available for distribution may also be adjusted by a transfer to, or from, the reserve account mechanism which has been adopted to stabilise the rate of interest allocated to member and productivity contributions. Employees share pro rata, according to their equity in the fund, in the distributed after-tax income, irrespective of whether they are full-time, part-time or casual.
      </para>
      <para>
       Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988
      </para>
      <para>
       This Act is the means by which the 3 per cent productivity benefit is provided to employees who are not members of the CSS or PSS or do not have their superannuation provided under a special arrangement (eg fixed-term employees continuing membership of a previous scheme). The Act is the renamed Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988, following extensive amendment in 1990 to put in place permanent arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Act generally requires employers to pay the productivity contributions for such employees to a fund approved by the Minister for Finance. The Minister has approved a number of industry-type funds under the Act to receive 3 per cent productivity contributions from employers. In addition, the Minister has nominated the industry fund, the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust (AGEST) to receive productivity contributions under the Act. Employees have the choice of contributing to the AGEST or an approved fund. In cases where the employee does not make an election contributions are paid to the nominated fund (AGEST).
      </para>
      <para>
       The amount of individuals' unfunded benefit at 30 June 1990, if any, under the interim arrangement is to be transferred by employers to either the AGEST or an approved fund, as appropriate, and hence become a funded employer contribution. Regular contributions are required by employers after the transfer.
      </para>
      <para>
       An amount of $0.60 per week is deducted from each weekly contribution paid to AGEST (irrespective of the amount of the contribution) and placed in a reserve account. All of the costs associated with the operation of AGEST (including administration, audit and legal costs) are met from the reserve. Funds remaining in the reserve are available for distribution to members.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is also a levy of $1.00 per weekly contribution for death and total and permanent disability insurance cover. Members who are already a member of another superannuation scheme which provides similar insurance cover may elect not to pay this levy to the AGEST.
      </para>
      <para>
       Like the CSS and PSS, the productivity contributions form part of the assessable income of the AGEST, as do earnings arising from the investment of the productivity contributions. After allowing for the $0.60 placed in the reserve account and, where applicable, the $1.00 death and total and permanent disability insurance cover, the taxable income of the fund is subject to tax at the rate of 15 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       Employees share pro rata, according to their equity in the AGEST, in the distributed after-tax investment income, irrespective of whether they are full-time, part-time or casual.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amounts charged by the various approved funds and the way they are levied may vary. For example, an approved fund may offset the administrative cost against income prior to the allocation of interest to members' accounts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other Provisions of the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act
      </para>
      <para>
       It was recognised that a flat weekly administrative charge could represent an unreasonably high proportion of a part-time or casual employee's productivity contribution. Accordingly, special provisions to cater for such cases have been determined by the Minister under the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the determination, employees currently earning less than $110 per week or on contracts of less than three months may elect to receive an unfunded benefit calculated in the same way as the interim arrangements that applied to Commonwealth employees between January 1988 and June 1990. Benefit payments of $500 or more must be preserved in accordance with the Occupational Superannuation standards. This enables low income earners and short-term employees to avoid the administrative charges payable on productivity contributions. Employees who elect to receive their benefit in this way would not have insurance cover for death and total and permanent disability.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Act also provides a safety net for employees for whom no productivity contributions or benefits have been provided (eg inadvertent omission by employers to pay contributions). It gives such employees a benefit calculated in the same way as the interim arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Special Arrangements
      </para>
      <para>
       Where special arrangements are made for fixed-term employees, the charges levied on the productivity contributions would depend on the nature of the special arrangement. In general, it is likely that where a private policy was arranged or payments were made to an industry fund, there would be some charges. Where membership of a previous employer's scheme was continued, any administrative charges would depend on the arrangements made by the employer.

      </para>
      <para>
       To try and calculate the impact on Social Security outlays and savings measures if a different economic situation had prevailed since March 1983 would be a hypothetical exercise requiring many assumptions about what Government economic and fiscal policies and market reactions would have been in a different set of circumstances.

       There were over 70 savings measures introduced within the Social Security portfolio over the first seven Budgets of the Labor Government. It would not be practicable to recalculate the savings outcome of each of these individual measures on the basis of a series of questionable assumptions.

       (2,3 &amp;4) Except as detailed below, the valuations of land reflect market value as assessed for Duesburys in 1986 by their valuers Richardson and Wrench. The actual values attached to land assets as a result of the Ministerial valuation of the Corporation's assets at transfer on 1 January 1988 were slightly in excess of the values determined by Duesburys. However, the increase is considered to merely bring the valuer's assessment up to date with the lapse of time between valuation and the Corporation's vesting date.

       Six airports, Darwin, Townsville, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Mt Isa and Canberra were acquired by the Corporation on 1 April 1989. The net price paid for these airports was reduced by the transfer of ongoing liabilities to the Corporation and an undertaking to develop new passenger terminal facilities at Alice Springs and Darwin Airports. As a result, the Corporation received a substantial discount on the new airports' net physical asset values. Accordingly, these airports were revalued at directors' valuation at 1 April 1989 based on market value of surrounding land.

       (1) Mr Don Taggart, Executive Officer, Office of Australian War Graves, visited the cemetery in June 1990 and his report contained the following text: ``Arrived at Kamunting Road Christian Cemetery at 9.30 am and at once was surprised at the size of the cemetery and the fact that from the outside I could see every grave. The cemetery was smaller than I expected and the three post war plots were immediately visible from the road. The condition of the cemetery was better than many civil cemeteries in Australia and I was able to walk freely throughout most areas. The grass was in need of cutting but the appearance did not prevent a visitor from quickly finding the post war plots. The grass in these plots had been mown only a few days earlier and the shrubs though sparse, were in good condition. The border areas were not dug over and were dry but had been recently raked. They were even and clean. The edges needed trimming and straightening and as mentioned in earlier reports the borders were too wide. All in all, a satisfactory appearance.''

       The Defence Adviser's staff, Kuala Lumpur, maintains an informal network (administration of war graves in Malaysia is a Consular matter) that reports on the condition of the various war cemeteries in Malaysia. In the case of the Kamunting Road Christian Cemetery on the outskirts of Taiping and the War Cemetery in Taiping the Defence Adviser's Office receive verbal reports on a six to eight weekly basis. The Officer Commanding Land Liaison Section Butterworth, a Major in the Australian Army, calls into these two cemeteries whenever he is undertaking duty travel in a southerly direction from Butterworth and reports on their condition by phone. The reports have always been positive with the most adverse comment received being that the grass required attention, with the rider that given the enormous rainfall often experienced in the area it is often difficult to maintain high horticultural standards. No formal reports have been submitted due to the positive nature of the comments received.

       (2) It is incorrect to state that the people of Palau have not yet had a chance to express their right to self-determination. Since 1983 Palauans have voted on seven separate occasions on a Compact of Free Association agreement negotiated between the governments of Palau and the United States. On each occasion a clear majority of voters has supported the proposed Compact, always less, however, than the 75 percent majority necessary to override the non-nuclear provisions of the Palau Constitution. Palau therefore remains under United States administrative authority as the last component of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Australian Government considers that a decision on the Compact and the termination of the Trusteeship with respect to Palau is a matter for the Government and people of Palau.

        —The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Closure of the line has freed AN of maintenance costs of about $100,000 per annum and will avoid the need for sleeper replacement after 1991/92, estimated at about $2 million. This was the last narrow gauge line into the Gladstone yard and closure will allow the yard to become a one-gauge operation. This will give operational savings and allow the return of some land to the State of South Australia for other uses.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) 28,627 tonnes were carried in 1987/88, the last year that the line carried wheat traffic. Assuming a net payload of 26 tonnes, approximately 1,100 truck trips would have been required to haul the grain carried during the 1987/88 season.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) The Federal Government does not hold this information.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5)and (6) Grain traffic had already transferred to road before closure occurred. Since the line was carrying no traffic when closed, retention of the line would have made no difference to the number of trucks on the road, nor to road trauma or environmental pollution.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The basis for closure of this line was that the South Australian Cooperative Bulk Handling (SACBH) had let the contract for the handling of grain in this area to road, commencing with the 1988/89 harvest and there was no real expectation that it would be regained by rail. The South Australian Government agreed to the closure. This is the normal pattern for the closure of grain lines in South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The use of roads by grain trucks and related issues are matters for the State and local Governments, which are responsible for the roads used by these trucks. The SACBH, which effectively determines the mode of transport of grain by awarding contracts for transport of grain from its silos to the ports, is a State instrumentality.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) It is a matter for Government to determine which of AN's operations should be supported financially by the taxpayer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) As mentioned under questions 5 and 6, this line closed because it was no longer carrying traffic. Consequently, the question of funding it as a Community Service Obligation did not arise. However, the Government has decided that AN's mainland freight operations should operate on a commercial basis. It would be necessary to identify a compelling social and/or environmental case to warrant changing this.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) From 1 February 1991 there will be 60 mobile review teams in operation throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The cost of running the mobile review teams in 1990-91 is expected to be approximately $16m. This consists of $12m for salaries, $2m for motor vehicle running expenses and $2m for travel allowances.
      </para>
      <para>
       The average cost of operating a full team per fortnight is $10 500.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) As a direct result of mobile review team activities for the 1989-90 financial year, cumulative savings in outlays per fortnight amounting to $4.6m were achieved by stopping incorrect payments of pensions and benefits.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Finance has accepted as reasonable that, in this type of case, payments would have continued for 26 fortnights (one year) but for a team's intervention.
      </para>
      <para>
       On this basis, estimated savings of $120.4m were attained as a result of deploying teams over the 1989-90 financial year. Overpayments of $9.3m were also identified. Each individual overpayment case is assessed to determine whether recovery action, waiver or write-off is appropriate. Separate data are not maintained on money recovered from overpayments identified by mobile review teams compared with other review activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the 1989-90 financial year, total overpayments raised as a result of all review activity undertaken by the Department or advised by clients amounted to $81.4m. During the same financial year $73.3m was recovered.

       Greystanes submitted a proposal dated 12 May 1989 to the Department for capital and recurrent funding for a 15/16 bed unit.
      </para>
      <para>
       Discussions between officers of the Department and Greystanes culminated in a meeting on 18 October 1989 to discuss this proposal. Departmental officers expressed their concern that a 15/16 bed unit would not further the Principles and Objectives of the Disability Services Act and advised that the current proposal would not be funded.
      </para>
      <para>
       In a letter of 1 February 1990 to the Department, the Executive Secretary of Greystanes acknowledged her recognition of the Department's reasons for not recommending funding for Greystanes' proposal of 12 May 1989.

       (5) The present proposal will not be funded.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department is committed to the development of new services to meet the demand in the Blue Mountains area. However, there is heavy competition for available funds. Each application is considered according to regional priorities, its merit in terms of furthering the Principles and Objectives of the Disability Services Act, and available funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) This question appears to imply that Grey-stanes would consider evicting 14 people, simply for becoming adults in their accommodation service. Although we all acknowledge that the adults could be more appropriately accommodated, such an action would cause the Minister concern about the level of commitment Greystanes has to these 14 people and to the Principles and Objectives of the Disability Services Act under which it receives Commonwealth funding.

       (8) Greystanes has been advised that their proposal for a 15/16 bed unit would not be funded under the Disabilities Services Act.

      <para>
       If Greystanes wishes to provide alternative services for any of their existing adult residents, the Department is willing to discuss proposals which further the Principles and Objectives of the Disability Services Act. However, it needs to be recognised that the existing funding designated for these residents would be transferred with them in any new accommodation arrangement funded under the Disability Services Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       If Greystanes then wished to expand their service by bringing in more children, they would be expected to make an application to the New South Wales State Government for funding, as State Governments have the primary responsibility for services for children with a disability.
