       Telecom: 0055 Services

      <para>
       3. These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.

       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

         —Order! Yesterday some senators questioned the propriety of a petition presented by Senator Coulter from certain persons overseas. The petition was presented by leave because it was not in the proper form required by the Standing Orders. Its defect was that it did not include a request for action by the Senate or by the Parliament in accordance with standing order 70 (2). There is nothing in the Standing Orders to prevent the presentation of a petition from persons who are not Australian citizens or residents of Australia.

        The speech read as follows-

       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the use of schemes of arrangement in complex corporate structures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where a group of companies consisting of a holding company and wholly-owned subsidiaries is to be involved in a scheme of arrangement, the law at present requires meetings to be held of each class of creditors of each company involved and each meeting must agree to the scheme. Where many group companies are involved in a number of States, the number of creditors' meetings required may run into the hundreds. The requirement of holding separate meetings can therefore present an enormous impediment to the creditors of a group of companies, seeking such an arrangement or compromise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation arises from the winding up of the Hooker group. In December 1989 the Government was approached by legal advisers to the provisional liquidators of the Hooker group of companies seeking an amendment to the Companies Act because of the considerable practical difficulties which the provisional liquidators were facing. Essentially, the problem faced by the liquidators was the need to convene some 500 separate meetings of various creditors across the whole of Australia because of the complex interrelationship of the ninety-odd companies which made up the Hooker group. The provisional liquidators were concerned that in these circumstances there was a real risk that it would not be possible to reach agreement on an appropriate scheme of arrangement which would enable the affairs of the companies to be wound up in a way which provided the maximum protection for creditors. What was originally sought was a specific amendment relating to the affairs of the Hooker group.
       </para>
       <para>
        My predecessor accepted that there was a need to facilitate schemes of arrangement for complex company structures. He was not, however, convinced that a legislative amendment simply to facilitate the winding up of the Hooker group was either appropriate or desirable. The Government agreed that legislation should be developed which would provide a general solution to problems of this kind. An essential element of such a scheme was that a court should decide whether or not a consolidated meeting of creditors should be held. This would enable the interests of shareholders to be protected as they could ensure that the court was aware of considerations particular to the circumstances of each case. A Bill was prepared as a matter of considerable urgency and discussions were held with the Australian Democrats and the Opposition. The Government proposed that the legislation would be passed by both Houses before the Parliament rose at the end of the Budget Sittings. This course of action required the co-operation of both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. It is unfortunate that, despite support from a number of senior members of the Opposition, it was not possible to reach agreement with the Opposition on the passage of the legislation. Because of the effluxion of time since the Hooker provisional liquidators proposed the legislation, there is no longer any certainty that the Bill when it becomes law will be used in that administration. It will, however, be available for other administrations of complex groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government was advised at the time the legislation was being prepared that major creditors were prepared to support a scheme of arrangement involving a consolidated meeting of creditors which would involve the payment of $45m to the small business creditors while major creditors waited for a considerable period for the assets of the Hooker group to be realised. Because of the failure of the Opposition to support the passage of this Bill that arrangement was not able to be put in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once it was apparent that the Opposition would not support the legislation which, I might add, had been the subject of agreement from each State and Territory Government under the existing co-operative scheme, the then Attorney-General released an exposure draft of the Bill for public comment. The exposure draft has received considerable support from interested groups including the Insolvency Practitioners' Association of Australia, the Law Council of Australia and the State Corporate Affairs Commissions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will enable a court to order meetings of creditors of a group of companies on a consolidated basis where the scheme of arrangement will have the effect of transferring assets, property and liabilities to the holding company. This consolidation will reduce the total number of meetings to a manageable number.
       </para>
       <para>
        The power given to the court is in addition to the powers the court already enjoys under the Companies Act, and the power is to be used in conjunction with the discretions the court has in determining the classes of creditors and protecting the interests of creditors.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill differs from the exposure draft in one respect. The exposure draft provided that the power to order a consolidation should arise only where the number of subsidiaries of the group was at least thirty. As a result of consideration by the Ministerial Council, this Bill allows consolidation orders to be made where the court considers that circumstances exist which would justify making such an order where there are fewer than thirty subsidiaries involved.

         —When the debate was interrupted last night I was making the point that the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 cannot be disagreed with in that it tidies up some drafting inadequacies which caused a few unintended consequences and anomalies. Therefore, the Australian Democrats will not be opposing it. I made the point in passing that it is a frustrating situation to be dealing with legislation which is of little consequence at a time when a great number of our rural communities are in the process of trying to get a message across to their parliamentarians.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the second reading speech we are told that the purpose of this Bill is to remove minor legislative inconsistencies and establish a framework for research and development. The implication throughout the speech was that the changes would lead to wondrous things in primary industry. It is all very well to have that framework, provided that the basis and direction of primary industry policy ensures that there will be a primary industry to start with. We are not convinced at the moment that there will be.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat that we are spending time talking about this sort of legislation when there are other matters to consider. Yesterday the Senate debated a matter of public importance, brought on by the Opposition, which did not seek to address the very matter that thousands of farmers want to communicate to this Parliament. We have used the time of the Senate to give all sorts of notices of motion and to consider other business of the Senate but we have not debated what we should be doing to bring about practical, active assistance to our primary industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to labour this point which I have already made several times. We should not waste too much time on this matter. We should pass the legislation and get on with the business of the Senate.

         —As has already been explained, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 seeks to make some minor amendments because of drafting problems. I want to highlight some aspects of the Bill and refer to some research contributions and their effects. I also want to agree with Senator Bell that we are spending time correcting mistakes that have been made because of insufficient attention to the initial drafting when we should be addressing the very serious situation now facing much of rural, provincial Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        First, I want to refer to a matter which I do not believe has been satisfactorily dealt with yet and which, if not resolved, could well result in the legislation coming back to this chamber again. I refer to the time limit for the Minister to grant approval after recommendations have gone to him. I believe that it is absolutely imperative that when a recommendation goes forward in terms of one of the research councils, the Minister should respond to it in a positive manner within a certain time and that if he does not, he must give the reasons for not doing so. It is inconceivable to me that under section 20 of the principal Act there is no discipline over the response of the Minister in terms of his responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to highlight some of the things that have occurred in rural research in recent times. In the cattle industry, some $63m a year of growers' funds is collected by way of a transaction levy and is used for promotion, marketing and inspection. Producers are paying $3.15 per head. An amount of $9.2m, of which $4.6m is raised by producers and $4.6m by processors, is paid into the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation area. I would like to highlight the fact that $21m has been allocated to the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to say something about methods of funding the national residue survey, which is now an industry responsibility rather than a government responsibility. While one can debate the community or government responsibility, I believe that there has been a reneging of responsibility. Export testing under the national residue survey not only benefits producers. It is worth noting that in 1987, when we had problems with the residues in exports, some 297 tests into cadmium in beef were carried out in Australia under the national residue survey. With the changes to the financial arrangements, in 1988 the number of tests grew to 2,878-a tenfold increase. When we look at all beef testing for the various residue problems that we had at that time, we find that in 1987 just under 10,000 tests were carried out. In 1988, as I said before, changes were made in terms of funding and the number grew to some 26,000 tests.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite obvious that the change to the method of funding has certainly made a difference in terms of the emphasis placed on testing. In terms of the 26,000 samples taken in 1988, only 16 violations were found. If we compare the Australian situation with that in other countries we find that we are second to none in terms of the level of residues in our export meat, particularly the beef industry. There is no doubt that much of the problem that occurred with the industry was political rather than factual. I believe that the increase in testing has certainly improved Australia's reputation worldwide. We are now poised, particularly in the beef market and, hopefully, in the not too distant future in the mutton market, to make some more significant penetrations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the debate on this Bill I want to highlight a number of points. It is rather unfortunate that the things we are discussing now are not as important as some of the things we should be looking at. Senator Bell has already picked up the point made yesterday by Senator Tambling about the letters presented to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), Dr Hewson and Mr Tim Fischer, which deal with the very significant problems that currently exist in rural Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to what happened yesterday when some 300 Western Australian farmers went to Midland seeking work and listed themselves for the unemployment benefit. I do not believe the Government is anywhere near coming to grips with the seriousness of the situation existing in rural Australia. When I talk about rural Australia I am obviously talking about the producers, the farmers and the graziers at the bottom line, and also about the service industries and the infrastructure that goes with them. In the current situation in the rural areas this infrastructure is at risk. The role played by local government-the shires-is at risk because we are moving towards a situation, which probably has not occurred since the 1930s, where people will not be able to pay part of their rates, let alone all of them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many things could be addressed here. They were listed yesterday in the debate on the motion moved by Senator Lewis. I was particularly disappointed with Senator McMullan's approach to this subject. Rather than address the shortcomings of the Government's current policies, he chose to attack the policies of the Opposition. In fact, he went so far as to claim that in some areas the Opposition does not have a policy. I find that very strange, particularly considering the failure of the Government since 1983. Regardless of how the economic and industrial policies of the Government are measured, the result has been an enormous blowout in our national debt and a monetary and fiscal policy which has led to excessively high interest rates and has caused many of the problems now being faced by rural Australia and its associated businesses and the bankruptcies that have occurred. Those policies have had an adverse impact in terms of interest rates and the flow-on through to the value of the dollar.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was rather interesting to note on television over the last couple of mornings that the value of the dollar has dropped about 1.5c. People may not realise this but, for wheat growers, that means approximately an extra $3.50 a tonne return. Many of the problems in relation to the wool stockpile and the wool industry could have been avoided had the Government not continued with its high interest rate, high dollar policy. It is worth noting that, when wool purchases by the Australian Wool Corporation peaked, the dollar was at US83c and 70 per cent of the clip was being bought whereas, when the dollar was at US75c, only 35 per cent of the clip was being bought. Many of the problems in the wool industry were created purely and simply by the Government's monetary and fiscal policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today I want to spend some time on a number of industrial relations cases that have occurred recently in Australia. We have heard much from Senator Cook about reliance on the umpire in determining the system that exists and in getting a rational and fair decision. I want to highlight four cases today. I think what is now occurring in this country is an absolute disgrace, particularly as it affects a number of our key perishable commodities. I want to refer specifically to the meat dispute in Victoria and the SPC and Heinz cases. Perishable commodities are involved in each of these cases. When irresponsible people take industrial action in cases involving perishable commodities, much valuable produce goes straight down the drain and that is what has occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the two cases involving the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in Victoria and in other States and in the Heinz case, directions have been given by the Arbitration Commission-the so-called umpire-for workers to go back to work and get on with the job because their case could not be sustained. However, what did that mean? Absolutely nothing! The unions just thumbed their noses at the Commission's decisions and we find that the umpire, without the ability to discipline them, is just laughed at.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I come to the figures on these cases, I touch briefly on another case in terms of structural efficiency, another matter of which we have heard much. It is worth noting that, on the other side of this chamber, only Senator Robert Ray is present and he is not paying any attention, anyway. I want to highlight the case in respect of the Federal pastoral award and refer to the principal structural efficiency changes made in that case. The Arbitration Commission put an order in place relating to increases in wages in the Federal pastoral award and said that, in the event of wet weather, shearers, crutchers and associated rouseabouts could work for up to 40 hours per week including weekends. That was a very sensible and essential reform, but what happened?
       </para>
       <para>
        The New South Wales branch secretary, Ernie Ecob, came out and said, `We will not do it.' He advised shearers to ignore it and to cross out form 10, I think it is, and write in a different clause saying that they would not do it. What is the point of Senator Cook, who is the Minister for Industrial Relations, talking in this place about structural efficiency and reform? What is the point of Senator Cook talking about the umpire when unions blatantly thumb their noses at the umpire? What is the point of the Arbitration Commission, which would have to be the most ineffective institution in this country, spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money sitting down at hearings and bringing down decisions or orders-the umpire's orders to quote Senator Cook again-which are totally ignored?
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe the Government is serious about structural efficiency. The Government sits back and says, `Let the umpire have another look at it'. However, the umpire has made his decision. He has gone through the process of analysing it and has come up with a sensible response which would have increased productivity and efficiency and would have addressed some of the problems we face in Australia. What happened? Nothing, because the unions still go out and hold the individuals-in this case the wool producers-to ransom. I will give a little warning here-the wool producers have had enough. They are going to stand up and fight. They will not take this lying down.

        I move on to make some brief comments on the SPC agreement. There was an agreement between the parties for real structural reform, a true enterprise agreement in which there would be profit-sharing and significant changes to the award under which all the parties were winners in the medium and long term. There is no doubt that in the short term sacrifices were being made, but they were being made on both sides of the scale. What happened? We mixed in big brother, the union boss, and the Industrial Relations Commission, and all that happened was that there was little if any structural reform and a reduction in workers' wages. There was no long term future, no security, no effective breakthrough in industrial relations. We ended up with the worst possible scenario and delayed the inevitable for a short time.

        I wish to talk a little about the Heinz case with regard to the tomato industry and what has occurred there. This would have to be one of the most despicable disputes that has ever arisen in this country. A tomato has a useful commercial life of about three days, and despite a direction from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-a direction given by Senator Cook's umpire-to the workers concerned to go back to work and get on with the job and to sort out the problems through the proper processes, what did those people do? They stayed out on strike, tomatoes were ploughed back into the ground, tins of baby food were not produced and the very viability of the Heinz operation was put at risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth running through some of the events that have occurred during the period of the dispute. On 20 February 1991-and one would think we were living in 1673 rather than in 1991-at the peak of the three-day period of which I have spoken, a 24-hour picket was set up outside the plant. It is about time that somebody got a bulldozer to push some of these pickets aside and allowed this country to get on with its job. Why did the workers set up the picket? It was because a couple of employees had been sacked by the company for unauthorised absences. They had had numerous warnings about the fact that they were coming late to work. Their case was taken to the Industrial Relations Commission. On 22 February 1991, the Commission issued a recommendation that union members should return to work. What happened? They stayed on strike. They ignored the umpire; the umpire was not worth a crumpet. What would have happened in the West Indies in the test match if Greg Matthews, having been given out when apparently he did not hit the ball, had stayed at the wicket and refused to go? That is precisely what is happening now in the case I have mentioned. I see Senator Robert Ray looking up. I am sure that he would not endorse the action that has been taking place during this dispute-or perhaps he likes the idea of tomatoes being ploughed into the ground. Maybe that is his scene-I do not know-but it is an absolute disgrace.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me look further at what has happened during this dispute. Some 2,000 tonnes of tomatoes were ploughed into the ground; 840 tonnes of fresh tomatoes worth $125,000 at the works rotted in their cases. The strike has crippled the main plant. The plant normally produces 1.25 million cans or bottles of product each working day. Those have been lost to the gross domestic product of this country, lost to our exports. Let us look at the position on 26 February 1991. The strike had cost the company and growers $5.5m in the past week; Heinz was losing $1m a day in sales alone. Let us go through estimations made on 27 February. We find that Victorian tomato growers were losing $500,000 a week. As one goes through this sad and sorry saga one appreciates better the impossible situation in this country, which is supposed to have an industrial relations system. Senator McMullan had the gall to stand up here yesterday and say that the Opposition did not have a wages policy, when we have in this country an industrial relations system that is so damned one-sided that it is an absolute disaster.
       </para>
       <para>
        In talking about the rural situation and its problems, and when we look at the Australian situation in general-our current account problems, our negative growth and the blow-out in our national debt-we realise that, unless that side of the equation is addressed effectively in the statement to be made on 12 March, we shall keep on going down the drain at 100 miles an hour. It is no good getting up in here and quoting figures as to how things have improved or how much better things are now than they were in the Fraser years. That is totally irrelevant in today's scenario. We now have the worst kind of guerilla warfare. Perishable products are being deliberately selected for action, and the abuse of the Industrial Relations Commission, the umpire, has become untenable. Some action needs to be taken in the current position that will give power to the Commission to apply orders that have some weight. Perhaps something similar to a sequestration order needs to be used so that the people who seek to hold companies, individual growers and the country to ransom will have to pay, and pay very dearly, for their irresponsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each case that I have highlighted-and one could address them over a significant period because there is a whole host of other angles-has been in defiance of the umpire. It was not as if there had been an endeavour to obtain agreement in a genuine case through the Industrial Relations Commission. Those concerned took the law into their own hands. This is particularly relevant in terms of the pastoral industry award. What did the New South Wales branch of the Australian Workers Union do? It did not take its concerns about the extension of the structural efficiency changes back to the Commission; it decided to make its own set of rules and to do what it wanted to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said earlier, the wool industry and individual growers will not take this lying down. I highlighted the fact that in Midland, just outside Perth in Western Australia, 300 farmers-good hardworking Australians, people who do not want to go on strike but who want to work-went to register for employment at the employment bureau. That is a very different attitude from what we see occurring here.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is absolutely essential when these matters are brought before this place for us to start addressing some of the serious anomalies. We should start looking for answers as to why our major rural industries have been brought to their knees. We should start to apply those answers and put a stop to the sorts of selective guerilla tactics that are occurring in this country right now. In this way we are losing valuable produce that could earn this country export dollars. It is produce that could create employment and increase our gross domestic product. It is time that we stopped this wastage and the irresponsibility that has been perpetuated by a few totally irresponsible Australians. If we are to take such action it is essential, unless the Government is prepared to adopt our approach to industrial relations and allow true enterprise agreements to be developed, that the Industrial Relations Commission be given some real teeth to deal with the industrial bandits who are tearing the heart out of a number of individuals.

         —I want to spend a moment of the Senate's time today during debate on this omnibus legislation to make some remarks in respect of rural industries generally and the meat industry specifically. As the Senate already knows, members of the National Farmers Federation and New South Wales farmers yesterday presented 35,000 letters in front of Parliament House in a protest to the Federal Government about the way things are going in rural Australia. It was coincidental yesterday also that in the rural industries grain prices fell across the board by about $30 a tonne, which was another slug to the grain growers of this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The letters that came in yesterday were for the most part addressed to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and to the Treasurer (Mr Keating). As we heard in Question Time yesterday, the Prime Minister is a man with many responsibilities and it would seem that he is too busy to spend any time with rural people or worrying about rural industries. However, as we learnt yesterday from Senator Button, he is not too busy, and neither should he be, to spend a day at the cricket. If that is the Prime Minister's priority, obviously that is why Australia has some of the problems that it has now. It is a sad reflection of the importance that this Government places on agriculture.
       </para>
       <para>
        For years, agriculture has been the convenient milking cow for this Government. Rural Australia has provided this country with much needed export income; it has for generations. It now seems that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are too busy to see these export income providers when they need help. As I said, all those letters that came from the farmers were addressed to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Unfortunately, they did not turn up.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation that we are debating changes amongst other things the name of the Australia Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC) to the Meat Research Corporation. I am told that this is being done to avoid confusion with the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. Other amendments will confine the Government's commitment to match industry research funding to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. There are a lot of people who live in cities and other areas away from the rural areas who say that farmers get handouts from the Government. There are still many who believe that the wool floor price scheme was a scheme for getting money from the Government; it was not. But this legislation restricting Government funding to 0.5 per cent shows very clearly that rural industry is overwhelmingly self-supporting, which it has been for years and which it will have to be in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        The AMLRDC has an annual budget of around $42m with over $13m coming directly from livestock levies and charges. I congratulate some of the people who were in that Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation: the Chairman, Nigel Monteith, the Executive Director, Ian McCausland, Kevin Bowtell, Archer Field, John Hall, Brian Hickman, Gerald Martin, Gardner Murray, Peter Stewart, Leonie Still, and Tony Wharton. They all do a great job for their industry as far as research is concerned. It is significantly important to people in the rural areas, especially in the livestock industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Corporation's most recent annual report, from which I have quoted those names, clearly outlined the various research projects that it is doing. I think that the range is as broad as it is exciting. However, I would like to think that one area that the Corporation might turn its attention to is research that demonstrates the healthy qualities of meat. Given that we are living in a rural economy, it depresses me that I read the following article in the Canberra Times on Tuesday, 5 March:
       </para>
       <para>
        Statistics revealing a shift towards a healthier diet.
       </para>

       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The most dramatic change in Australian diets appears to be the shift away from red meat, Australians getting through 83.3 kg a head in 1987-88, compared with 86.1 kg in 1982-83 and 112.4 kg in 1958-59.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could say, and I am quite sure that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), who is at the table, would agree with me that red meat is good for us. Anything is good for us that is within the bounds of keeping a good balance in our diets. In fact, if we give away eating red meat, for example, we are going to have a very big problem with our health because of iron deficiencies. We have to keep red meat in our systems. As a person who produces red meat, I would like to see more people eating it, because it is healthy and it is good for us; especially the lean meat that is being produced at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that a reading of that article suggests that Australians are getting healthier because they are eating less red meat. Of course, that really is not the case at all. I believe that there are a lot of benefits from eating red meat. The cattle and sheep producers benefit from it and the person who eats it benefits from it as well. I am not at all happy about articles like that which we see in the papers and which are denigrating one of our Australian industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Meat Research Corporation has been carrying out research trials on new lean meat sheep breeds such as the Coolalee-a breed developed in Australia by an Australian vet-which produced a leaner, larger-framed carcass lamb to cater for health conscious Australians. I would like to see an article in these papers promoting that and promoting something that is going to make things a little better for people in the rural areas by in fact helping people's health.
       </para>
       <para>
        I had a checkup the other day and the doctor said, `Are you eating much red meat?'. I said, `I am eating a little bit'. He said, `You keep eating it because it is a very important part of anyone's diet to keep eating it; definitely not to eat too much fat but definitely to eat red meat'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The same developments are occurring with cattle as they are with sheep. We are now seeing the established British breeds of cattle, using crossbreeds with a traditionally leaner European breeds. The message that is perpetuated in Australia that it is somehow not healthy is not right. I can attest to that and I am quite sure that the Minister at the table would attest to that, as would my colleagues on this side.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rural Australia is desperately strapped at the moment. It is imperative that all Australians start to think about agriculture every time they shop. I think that is a lesson that we could all consider. It is not really achieving a lot if we are buying things off the shelves that have been imported. If this Government is too busy to consider the plight of rural Australia, then it is up to the rest of us, both inside and outside Parliament, to support our farmers. I know that Senator Panizza supports the farmers in Western Australia. Senator Knowles supports the farmers in Western Australia because she knows the value that they are to the economy and to the community. Senator Parer from Queensland, who is sitting on the front bench of the Opposition at the moment, soon to be in Government, agrees with me that we must all do more in our support, consideration and understanding for the Australian farmers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 1971 Australian farmers have increased their productivity by 2 per cent every year. They have done that without any export enhancement program such as United States farmers get. Yesterday in Question Time I asked Senator Button why the Prime Minister was not going on the trade mission. Why is he not leading a bipartisan group consisting of himself, Dr Hewson and Tim Fischer-they would really make a mark in Washington-instead of sending Minister Blewett, who has been there many times? I know that he will do his best. He is sending a backbencher from the Government; of course, we are sending our two frontbenchers-Mr Lloyd, the shadow Minister for primary industry, and Mr Downer, the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations. If they were to get into the White House they might have a chance of achieving a little more. Unfortunately, I believe that they will find that they are not heard in the way we need them to be heard. They are trying to get the Americans to understand what their export enhancement program is doing to Australia generally, not just to the Australian farmers. It affects the constituents of Senator Ray just as much as it affects the constituents of those who are principally representing rural areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian farmers are the most efficient in the world. It is time that this Government gave us a little thought on the way through and did not neglect the rural industry. I believe the Government will do that at its own peril.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other aspects of this legislation deal with changes to the Dairy Produce Act and the Horticultural Research and Development Act. They have been well covered by other senators. I am sure that Senator Panizza will cover some of those areas in a moment or two.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to conclude my remarks by reminding honourable senators yet again that while the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country might be too busy to worry about rural Australia, our farmers will not be forgotten by the people on this side of the chamber. I have every confidence that they will emerge from this crisis wiser and stronger and back on top of the tree when the Liberal and National parties are the government of this country.

         —The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is an omnibus Bill which is far reaching. It deals with the changing of names, which has caused confusion. I cannot see why there was such a great amount of confusion. However, the Government claims, and the media considers that these names have been confusing, so we have an omnibus Bill which will correct the situation that exists at present.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In passing, I mention that this Bill amends the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill. It has only had the name changed. Honourable senators may recall that I spoke pretty strongly on this Bill at the time. I believe that it hurt some part of the industry. I am talking about pastoral area cattle station owners and sheep station owners where there is a walk in, walk out situation and one could not really separate the stock from the rights to the leasing of the station. The rights have been sold on the 99-year lease.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment to the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill was to change the onus on paying certain levies from the processor of meat to the producer of meat. The change occurred around 25 February. When the buyer bought in the saleyards after that one expected that he would be paying more because he had more money to play with, the onus being on the producer to pay the levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have done research around Australia and I can assure honourable senators that there was no change whatsoever in the return to the producer; in fact, it diminished around that time and there was the added burden of having to pay the levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a great research organisation in Australia which deals with primary industry. Unfortunately, research money will be drying up in time to come. The Government is limited to 0.5 per cent of total production of that industry. The value of the total production will be decreasing, as will research money that is coming from the Government and research money coming out of the industry itself. Research is ongoing. It is not done overnight, over two years or even five years; it is a continual, slow, grinding process and, as I have already said, it will get a reduced amount of money over the years in this downturn.
       </para>
       <para>
        We certainly have to look into that matter. The Government may have to increase its contribution at least in the short term during the agricultural downturn, otherwise programs will have to be cut. If programs and research are cut, that will have devastating results in the longer term.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will move on to the rural problems that exist around Australia. I believe that these problems have not yet got through to the Government. As has been mentioned, yesterday representatives of the New South Wales farmers organisation were delivering letters to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) at the front of Parliament House.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that the seriousness of this situation has got through to the Government. I know that some of these problems have not got through to many of my own colleagues from the eastern seaboard and in the heart of the biggest cities. I believe that the people in the west certainly know what is going on because of the number of meetings they have attended. There were 10 or 12 crisis meetings before Christmas and there have been various seminars since Christmas regarding ways to survive this economic downturn. I do not think the Government has a grip of it. If it has, it is not coming out with anything to relieve the situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first week of March has gone and planning for next week's wheat crop in Australia should be in the advanced stages. Farmers who have suffered a downturn certainly do not know which way to go. They do not know whether to plant a crop. If they do intend to plant a crop, those who need finance do not know whether they will get it and where it will come from. This has already had an effect on the suppliers of agricultural imports. At one seminar I questioned a speaker from the fertiliser supply organisation. He told me that compared to this time last year only about 20 per cent of the superphosphate has been distributed. Of course, that could produce logistic problems a bit later in the year when there may be a sudden rush in buying fertiliser and transporting it to the farms. Delivering it from the factories could be a problem. The same situation exists with chemicals that are needed on a crop and the labour that will be hired on those farms when seeding time comes. That is all up in the air. The seasonal workers who normally go out to those jobs, people who spend the rest of the year in shearing sheds, driving council trucks or even in mines, will not be in a position to know what is going on at seeding time.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is something that the Government must address now that we have got into this situation. The industry has asked for a temporary guaranteed minimum price (GMP) of wheat to do something with the disastrous downturn we have had in the last six months, when the price of wheat around the world has crashed because of the actions of the United States (US) Government and its export enhancement program.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not a believer in subsidies, but our own wheat industry willingly gave up the guaranteed minimum price that used to work on a three-year rotation basis, under the Wheat Marketing Bill that went through this Parliament about 18 months ago. Unfortunately, the industry has now woken up to the fact that it should have kept it and maybe given up some of the other aspects that it wanted to keep. It finished up losing the regulation of the domestic market-which I totally agreed with anyhow-but it kept the regulation of the export market. It should have insisted that the Government keep the three-year rotating average. The three-year rotating average used to keep the price from drastically dropping overnight, as has happened in the last six months. Unfortunately, that has gone now, but the industry is trying to get a GMP, even if it is only on a one-year basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the wheat industry could turn around fairly quickly and could turn around in time for next year. Unfortunately, the people who have to borrow finance and who need to be confident about planning to put in a crop need something better than a blue sky to give them encouragement. There is another aspect: if a decent sized crop is not planted for next year we will lose our traditional markets around the world and we have got to hang on to them. I know we are already losing some traditional markets because the US is muscling in on us, but I think the Government should look at a temporary GMP of some sort for next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that wool will certainly not turn around for five, six or seven years, but wheat could turn around overnight. If it does, then rural Australia could get moving again, even if it is on a temporary basis waiting for wool to turn around as well. The beef industry was doing reasonably well, but if there is to be some shift from wheat and wool to beef I believe we will have an oversupply in the meantime.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat, the Government must look at some sort of GMP. If the Government were to provide a GMP of $150 it would not mean that it would be putting in $30 a tonne. It would mean that it could be. If the wheat industry around the world does turn around-and, as I said, it could turn around overnight-the Government would not have to put up a cent. A GMP would give people the confidence to plant something like a normal crop to maintain the present structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we have this not-so-high delegation going off to the United States today. When I say `not-so-high delegation' I do not reflect on my colleagues who are going-the shadow Minister for primary industry, Bruce Lloyd, and the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations, Mr Downer. I believe that in this situation, the most disastrous for the wheat industry for 50 years, a top level delegation should have gone to the United States, led by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and ably backed by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson. However, this has already been debated in this chamber, and that was not to be. Obviously, the rural industry and rural communities around Australia are not important enough for the Prime Minister to spend a day in Washington to bring the situation to the attention of his counterpart, Mr Bush. I believe that the Government has failed us badly. As we have cooperated with the United States in the Gulf and other places, such a move would not have been out of the question.
       </para>
       <para>
        What amazes me is why this delegation which is going off to the United States is not going to the European Economic Community (EEC) as well. In this game of a trade war we need two to tango and there are two sides at fault. There is the US with its export enhancement program, and the European Common Market. Nobody even gives the European Common Market a mention.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may remember that last year I moved a formal notice of motion in this place condemning the United States for its enhancement program-it had just taken a traditional market in West Africa off us. The day after, an agricultural attache of the United States Embassy came around to my office to see me. He thought that the motion regarding the US was fair enough, but he wanted to know why I did not give the European Common Market equal time. At the time I told him, `Well, it was the United States that annoyed me that day; when the EEC annoys me I will do the same'. Unfortunately, not enough attention is being paid to the fact that the European Common Market needs to be made well aware of what it is doing in hurting Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, I believe that the delegation should be charged with ensuring the protection of our traditional markets in the Gulf. Iraq was our second biggest customer for wheat after Egypt; Japan was the third; and probably number four was China. With the United States Government having done the most to relieve Kuwait, Australia should make sure that we get back our market share when everything is over, including our share of the live sheep trade into Kuwait. It amazes me once again that this delegation is not moving into that area as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will move on to a few points that have been mentioned by other speakers. Senator Crane, in his very able delivery in this place on this subject, mentioned a few of them. Employer bashing was one of them. He was talking about the graziers and the shearing industry in New South Wales. With Australia being in the economic mess that it is, one would think that members of this Government would let up a certain amount on their continual bashing of, and loading up of responsibilities on, employers. After all, the employer is the one that provides the jobs. I believe that an employer is entitled to a fair return on the capital that he risks. He is not keeping a business going just for the fun of it and to supply employment to employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyone who read the West Australian last week would have seen an article quoting our illustrious Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Ronald Edwards, regarding a young 16-year-old who was employed in a shopping centre. He was employed by a contract cleaner. Obviously, the cleaner had a contract to do the cleaning in the shopping centre and needed someone to recover the shopping trolleys that were left scattered around the car park and on the street. This 16-year-old was quite happily bringing home $322 a week on average. He could not get a job anywhere else. He had left school the year before.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Edwards pointed out to the union that this boy was working too many hours for that $322. Recovering shopping trolleys is not an arduous job, nor is it continuous. Certain times of the day are quiet. The fiasco created and helped along by Mr Edwards resulted in an argument between the union and the contract cleaner. The shopping centre ended up not being cleaned and the shopping trolleys not being collected. The probable result is that this young fellow, who was bringing home $322 a week, has gone on to the dole queue and social security. The firm doing the cleaning lost the contract. Thanks to Mr Edwards, that is what has happened.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators have probably read in the press that Mr Hand, our Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, has made big noises to the effect that Australia has too many illegal immigrants. I agree. But if that is the case, it is the fault-the wrongdoing or slackness-of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, which is not catching up with illegal immigrants. What has Mr Hand said? He has said he will increase the penalties on employers who employ-`knowingly', he said-illegal immigrants. Where are we heading? Are we heading back to the Australia Card?
       </para>
       <para>
        As a longstanding employer, all I know is that I am entitled to ask prospective employees for a tax file number; I have to ask that they sign a tax rebate form and a declaration form if they have dependants; and I think I am entitled to ask that they produce a drivers licence if they will be driving a vehicle of mine. I do not think I am entitled to ask for anything else. I am certainly not entitled to ask for a marriage certificate. I do not think I am entitled to ask for a naturalisation certificate or a birth certificate.

         —Or a passport and, in fact, whether or not the person has one. Mr Hand suggests that he will introduce stiff penalties. But who will prove whether these people are employed knowingly or unknowingly? Employer bashing in Australia is increasing. Employers have other things to do as well: they are free tax collectors and free collectors of child support. I know that office work in business has virtually doubled in the last five years.

        I move on to some further problems around Australia. There was a call by Father Brian Morrison in Western Australia for free or cheap meat to be given to needy families. That is a noble gesture and it has been done. But who gives the freebie? The farmer is expected to give away sheep for free or for very little money. The next step is the transport of the sheep. That is not free. Then the sheep go into the abattoirs. That is not free. Senator Crane very ably pointed out the problems in the abattoirs, which I will not go into now. But there are problems with our work practices in terms of the quota system in our abattoirs. Most slaughtermen knock off at 11.30 a.m. with a full day's pay. Because of these and other work practices, abattoirs cannot be kept going 24 hours a day. This meat is provided cheaply or for free but some people are not prepared to do their bit.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have quoted figures in this chamber time and again and I will provide them again. In Australia it costs a minimum of $13 to slaughter a sheep and put it on the hook; in America it costs under $5. In Australia it costs $19 to put a sheep into cans; in America it costs less than half of that. In Australia it costs $120 per head to slaughter cattle whereas in America it costs from $35 to $40. Even if we want to provide cheap or free meat to the needy, not everyone will do his bit. I do not want abattoir workers to work for nothing; I just want them to do a day's work while they are there and get the product out so that those costs come down and we can provide this cheap meat.

        I believe that 12 March will be D-day for all Australian industries and, indeed, all the population. On this day the Prime Minister will bring down an economic impact statement. We do not know what will be contained in that statement but many things need to be done to get this country going again. As I said, hopefully there will be some mention of a temporary GMP for next year's wheat planting. But we also need other things. Probably most of all, we need an accelerated depreciation on developments.

        The mining industry is still doing pretty well around Australia and it is contributing to the economy. But unfortunately at this stage it is not going into any major projects. There are certain reasons for that, such as the locking up of resources, aided and abetted by the green movement. Apart from that, some can make a move with accelerated depreciation.

        A compact steel mill is proposed in the south-west of Western Australia. This would be very important for Western Australia. A good friend of mine, Dr Ivankovich, has been working on the feasibility of putting such a steel mill in the south-west. But there is no way that we can compete with Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea. I think a similar kind of mill and technology was commissioned in or near Poland last year. There is no way that we can compete with the present labour structure and the taxation structure. With an accelerated depreciation system, I believe that we could get many of those industries going. This would provide employment for the labour from other industries, such as the wheat and wool industries, that are in trouble. I hope that this measure will be included in the statement of 12 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser moved in this direction in 1975-76-77. Mr Fraser's accelerated depreciation system was more an investment allowance on top of depreciation which meant a doubling up of the investment allowance. He could have placed that extra investment allowance on Australian produced material that went into the industries. Had Mr Fraser done that rather than import material and machinery, Australian manufacturing may have been in a far better position. However, as Australian manufacturing is almost non-existent now, I believe that something like this should be developed, irrespective of whether the materials or the machinery for this technology is imported. Australia, particularly the remote areas, and the industries are in a very precarious position at the present moment. I look forward to measures being announced in the 12 March statement that will assist those industries so that all Australians will be provided with the income and standard of living that we have been used to and hope will continue.

         —in reply-Listening to the contributions of honourable senators in this debate, it would have been difficult to believe that they were speaking on a Bill that is concerned with the strategic and operational plans of research and development councils or whether the report concerning the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984 should be placed in the annual report. This is a minor Bill, with minor technical details being cleared up. Given that the three research bureaus of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy spend between them $86m a year and the research programs of the development corporations and councils amount to $153m a year, half of which is taxpayers' money and half of which is money raised through industry levies, one could understand the need for the changes that are in the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. We have had some wide ranging speeches that were interesting but had nought to do with that Bill. While I would love to answer some of the comments made by honourable senators in the debate, I am not sure that would assist us in our consideration of the legislation. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

        —The coalition will not be opposing the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990, the purpose of which is to give police the specific power, on arresting a person in relation to Commonwealth offences, to question such persons and to carry out further investigations. This is really a question of the balance of the requirements of law enforcement agencies in investigating suspected offences and the civil liberties issues which are inherent in the pre-charge detention of arrested persons. The Opposition has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate that the police should have the power to detain arrested persons for purposes of questioning and investigation and that it is desirable that the detention of persons arrested for Commonwealth offences should be governed by separate Commonwealth legislation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The approach in this Bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for the introduction of a fixed period of time during which a person can be detained by the police before being charged in relation to a Commonwealth offence. Having given serious consideration to the arguments advanced by the Government in support of the fixed period of time for precharge detention, the Opposition has come to the view that on balance a more flexible approach would be preferable. Therefore, we will be opposing those provisions of the Bill which set out the time limits and will be moving amendments to provide for the detention of arrested persons for a reasonable time.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bill also provides for a number of procedural safeguards relating to the rights of arrested persons, which we support. The most important provision introduced in this Bill is the mandatory tape-recording of confessions and admissions obtained during detention, the giving of cautions, for example, the caution regarding the suspect's right to remain silent, and the arrested person's responses to those cautions are also to be tape-recorded.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other principal safeguard introduced in this Bill-the statutory right to communicate with relatives and legal practitioners-is also strongly supported by the Opposition. It is presently the case, when a person is arrested for an offence against Commonwealth law, that it is the law of the State or Territory in which the arrest is made that applies, by virtue of the operation of section 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903. There are some specific provisions in various pieces of legislation, such as the Customs Act, that vary this position.
      </para>
      <para>
       This means that in New South Wales the common law applies and this rule, in slightly varying forms, has been given statutory force in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. South Australia has a maximum period of four hours and in both Victoria and the Northern Territory a reasonable time period applies. At common law there is no power to detain the person who is suspected of having committed a crime for the purpose of questioning that person or for completing an investigation. An arrested person should be brought before a magistrate as soon as is reasonably practicable.
      </para>
      <para>
       For example, in the 1986 High Court decision in the case of Williams the relevant State law provided that the suspect should be brought before a justice as soon as practicable. It was held that the police had no power to question an arrested person about the offence for which he had been arrested or other offences and that a delay in bringing a person before a magistrate could not be justified by the fact that the arresting officer wished to question that person.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question of whether the police should have the power to detain arrested persons for questioning and, if so, what the limits on the exercise of such a power should be, has been the subject of many inquiries and reports. The major report in this area is that of the Committee Reviewing Commonwealth Criminal Law, chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs. The Gibbs Committee came up with a series of recommendations in relation to pre-charge detention. The principal recommendation was that a period of six hours apply in the case of serious offences and in other cases a period of four hours.
      </para>
      <para>
       In calculating the relevant time period, the Committee recommended that certain periods of so-called dead time be excluded because questioning of the arrested person or investigation of the suspected offence cannot take place. This dead time would cover such matters as the time taken to transport the arrested person to the nearest police station, the time taken for the person to communicate with a relative, a friend or a legal practitioner, and any time during which the questioning is delayed due to the arrested person receiving medical attention or being intoxicated. The Committee took the view that any detention period less than six hours would be impractical due to the difficulties experienced in Victoria in 1984 where the system was introduced of a fixed six-hour pre-charge detention period. An extension could not be made without the consent of the arrested person.
      </para>
      <para>
       The system proved unsatisfactory in several important respects. The six-hour period was inadequate in the case of complex investigations or where there were multiple offences and the need to apply for extensions of time disrupted the continuity of investigations. The time could easily be eroded by travelling or by obtaining medical treatment or legal advice. There was also a tendency for the six hours to be regarded as the norm rather than as the maximum and arrested persons might be detained for the full six hours when this was unnecessary for the purposes of the investigation involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Coldrey committee, which reviewed the system in 1986, came to the view that the prescription of a fixed period was too inflexible and recommended that the police be required to take an arrested person before a magistrate within a reasonable time. This committee further recommended that dead time be excluded from the calculation of the reasonable time.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Bill which the Government has introduced is based largely on the recommendations of the Gibbs Committee, although it is proposed that no distinction be made between summary and serious offences in relation to the maximum period of pre-charge detention, which is to be four hours. The maximum period for which a person under the age of 18 years or an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander may be held is to be two hours. The Bill provides for an extension of up to eight hours of that maximum period by way of application to a magistrate, who must be satisfied that this is justified in the particular circumstances of the case.
      </para>
      <para>
       In calculating the maximum period, provision is to be made for excluding dead time, as recommended by the Gibbs Committee. When the relevant time period expires the person arrested must be either released, unconditionally or on bail, or brought before a magistrate so that the question of bail or remand in custody can be dealt with.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Bill also addresses the difficulties arising from the situation at common law with respect to confessions obtained during detention. Since the Williams case, where a confession is obtained from a suspect while he or she is in police custody, after the time when it has been reasonably practical to bring him or her before a magistrate, the confession is liable to be rejected at the discretion of the trial judge as having been unlawfully or unfairly obtained. There is an exception where legislation, either Commonwealth legislation or applied State and Territory legislation, lays down a different rule. Under this Bill it will be clear to arresting police that a confession or admission will be admissible only if it is obtained during the permitted period of detention. There is a safeguard for arrested persons in that material relating to confessions or admissions obtained during the pre-charge detention must be tape-recorded.
      </para>
      <para>
       One aspect of this Bill which disturbs the Opposition is the apparent failure of the Government to consult with the Australian Federal Police and the State and Territory governments about the changes to be introduced by the Bill. We would have thought that consultation with the groups which will be most affected by this Bill would have been an essential part of the process of initiating the significant modifications proposed here. One of the reasons why consultation in this area with the States and Territories is essential is that this Bill may impose significant difficulties upon law enforcement agencies when arresting persons suspected of both Commonwealth and State offences, which is of course a reasonably common occurrence. The most obvious solution is uniform State and Territory legislation. Obviously this cannot be achieved without consultation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Commissioner McAulay of the Australian Federal Police said in a letter to the National Secretary of the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA) that he believed that the imposition of arbitrary time constraints on the interrogation of suspects in important and complex matters is impractical and likely to impede justice and is, therefore, against the public interest. He is of the view that these constraints will result in lower detection and conviction rates and an escalation in the costs of trials.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Federal Police Association was not consulted on the provisions of the Bill. The AFPA rejects the concept of maximum detention times before charging as fraught with risks for the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal law enforcement and the discharge of justice in the interests of the entire Australian community. The AFPA contends that the Federal Police have a higher percentage of complex and advanced investigations than their State counterparts. The length of time available for interviewing persons in custody is an essential element of criminal investigation and must be treated in a flexible case by case manner to be truly successful. Thus, the concept of reasonable time is the only one which can effectively work in the Federal jurisdiction. It also appears that the Federal Government has not consulted with State and Territory governments about the impact of these changes on their police forces when investigating Commonwealth offences.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I indicated, the Opposition will not be opposing this Bill, but we are of the view that State and Territory governments and the Australian Federal Police should have the chance to contribute their views on this proposed legislation, which will have such a significant effect on their police operations. Furthermore, we believe that the issue of a fixed time period as opposed to a more general specification such as a reasonable time merits reconsideration in the light of the Victorian experience, which found the longer six-hour period unsatisfactory.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Opposition has, therefore, foreshadowed its intention to pursue these aspects within the committee system of the Senate and within that committee to move an amendment to provide that arrested persons may be detained for a reasonable time. The procedure, I understand, has been implemented for this Bill to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs after this second reading debate. I trust that at some stage there will be negotiations with the responsible Minister and with the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, who is no doubt talking to the Chairman of the Committee, about getting a range of witnesses before the Committee, probably on Friday week. State Attorneys-General representatives, State police representatives, the Law Council of Australia, and such organisations as the Institute of Criminology, we believe, should have the opportunity to put their views directly before the Federal Parliament; and our committee system and the reference of Bills procedure facilitate that occurring.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subject to the debate that will occur within the Committee, as I have indicated, we will move our amendment proposing that a `reasonable time' be substituted for the fixed time period provided for in this Bill. We hope that by then the Government will have been persuaded of the merit of our amendment and that the Bill will in due course be carried with the substitution of a reasonable time for the fixed period in the Government's proposal. As I indicated, in all other respects we support the Bill.

       As I understand it, the Bill will be referred to the Committee for its consideration of the question of the proper time to allow the authorities, usually the police, to detain someone for the purposes of conducting investigations before actually charging that person. The issue of whether the police should have a reasonable time to investigate a person before they charge him or her, whether that time should be four hours, six hours or eight hours, when baldly stated does not sound all that dramatic. Although that issue does not seem to be dramatic, it raises issues that are quite fundamental to the sort of society in which we want and expect to live. It raises the question of what is a free, tolerant and just society. One of the centrepieces of such a society is the ability of people to go about their business freely and unhampered and not to be questioned by the state, through the police that it employs or otherwise. That is the matter being discussed here.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a matter of public policy in a country such as Australia that people should not be arrested arbitrarily or held at the whim of others. It is also, no doubt, a matter of public policy that when crime is committed it should be detected; indeed, that crime should be prevented before it happens. It is obviously in the interests of the public that that should occur. Clearly, any reasonable society has to equip its police forces with the ability to detect crime and to bring persons alleged to have committed offences before the courts. They are the two public interests that must be balanced against each other.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a long tradition in the British common law that addresses those two, as it were, conflicting public interests-although I think they conflict in theory rather than in reality. Clearly, there have to be procedures open to the police to enable them to find out who committed a crime and to prosecute that person. At the same time, there has to be a limit on that. That limit is not inconsistent with the proper means being available to the police to carry out their functions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Originally, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you no doubt know, the concept was that under common law police could not detain a person for any time at all after arrest for the purposes of carrying out investigations. Since I do not want to indicate that I have a closed mind on this subject, I shall go to what some eminent judges have said over the years to give a flavour of what was once the law. In the case of Wright v. Court and others, the court said that it is the duty of a person arresting anyone on suspicion of a felony to take him before a justice as soon as he reasonably can. It said that the law gives no authority, even to a justice, to detain a person suspected but for a reasonable time until he may be examined.
      </para>
      <para>
       What was understood to be the meaning of `a reasonable time' and `as soon as practicable' was that a person arrested should be brought before the magistrate as soon as practicable. A different interpretation was put on that by Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in Dallison v. Caffery in 1964. The Wright v. Court matter was heard in 1825, long before Lord Denning came onto the scene. Lord Denning said that, if a constable, as distinct from a private person, arrested somebody suspected of a felony, he could take a reasonable time to investigate the matter before bringing the person before a court. So there was a shift in the meaning of `as soon as practicable' from that of bringing someone suspected of a crime before a court as soon as practicable in terms of the physical ability to get the person from the place of arrest to the court, according to Lord Denning's interpretation, which was as soon as it was practicable for the police to conclude their investigations.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been a change in that grand tradition coming down through the common law. There has been a change from the emphasis on protecting people's rights to one of giving the police time for investigation. That was the situation as it applied in England. In Australia there was a disinclination to follow what Lord Denning had said. That is clearly illustrated by a judgment by Mr Justice Hampel of the Supreme Court of Victoria, who in 1983 said:

      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       refer to the time required to bring the person arrested before a justice and not to the time which the police may choose to take after arrest to make further enquiries or conduct further investigations.
      </para>
      <para>
       He referred to the judgment of His Honour Mr Justice Deane of the High Court of Australia. The words of Mr Justice Deane are worth quoting. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       A police power or practice of arbitrary detention is, like a police power or practice of arbitrary arrest, a negation of any true rights to personal liberty and a hallmark of tyranny. It is of critical importance to the existence and protection of personal liberty under the law that the restraints which the law imposes on police powers of arrest and detention be scrupulously observed.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is in everybody's interest that people be brought to justice, but the means by which they are brought to justice should certainly have some set limits. Since I am quoting judges, it is proper to quote a decision of the Vice-Chancellor, Sir Knight Bruce, who, in 1846, had this to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination, nor probably would the purpose of the mere disclosure of truth have been otherwise advanced by a refusal on the part of the Lord Chancellor in 1815 to act against a solicitor, who, in the cause between Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Clinton, had acted or proposed to act in the manner which Lord Eldon thought it right to prohibit.
      </para>
      <para>
       Then he goes on to say, and I would like to emphasise this:
      </para>
      <para>
       Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely-may be pursued too . . . . keenly-may cost too much. And surely the meanness and mischief of prying into a man's confidential consultations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness, and suspicion and fear, into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we listen to the arguments put that there ought to be a greater period than four hours-certainly when this matter comes before my Committee I will listen with an open mind-or reasonable time should be allowed, without its being defined, it is to be remembered that this practice of taking people in and detaining them against their will before charging them has had legal sanction in recent times only; that the grand tradition of common law, which we resort to so often, was that a person be arrested and brought before a justice or a magistrate as soon as practicable. The move away from that has brought some very difficult issues as to what should and should not happen.
      </para>
      <para>
       I notice that the New South Wales Law Reform Commission brought out a report in December last year dealing with police powers of detention and investigation after arrest, and the time period fixed in the model Bill allows for four hours custody before a matter goes before a magistrate-I do not know whether a justice is provided for there-or before the courts. What is wrong with the proposition that a person should be taken before a magistrate after four hours-or whatever is a reasonable time within that period-and put his position to a magistrate?
      </para>
      <para>
       One concern I have with the Bill-I hope this will be discussed in the Committee-is that an application for an extension of the investigation period can be made in certain circumstances before a justice of the peace. There are many fine people who generously give their time to be justices of the peace, but I have considerable concern about their ability to judge a matter in a way where the result is fair. I am not accusing them of being deliberately unfair, but the way they go about their task may not always result in what is fair.
      </para>
      <para>
       A long while ago now, in the years when I had occasion to appear before justices of the peace, I found them to be deficient in an appreciation of what the phrase `reasonable doubt' meant. There is always a tendency, I think, for them to accept whatever is asked for by the policing authorities. What is being sought is an eight-hour extension where people can be held and detained without being charged. It is a very serious matter, and to leave that decision before one or more untrained people seems to me to be a fairly adventuresome trend. Again, I have no final thoughts about that issue except to say that I am much concerned at this point that these applications for extension periods can be brought before a justice of the peace.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact of the matter is that none of us would like to be detained in some enclosed space in an area where we were being questioned, where we were divorced from our usual surroundings and where we were asked questions which may rightly or wrongly lead us to be convicted.
      </para>
      <para>
       Oftentimes what is put forward to illustrate the need for a greater period than four hours is the fact that we have complex issues coming before the police. On the other hand, to detain an inexperienced person-who may be 20, still at home, and unused to the world's ways-locked away for four hours could be a matter of considerable terror for him because it is clear that convictions are obtained on confessions that are not true.
      </para>
      <para>
       An illustration of that is given in the Herald-Sun today. It relates to a hearing in England of six people who were accused of being members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). They were convicted in the 1970s and there have been several appeals since. Those appeals were rejected. It now appears that much of the evidence, including the confessions, was quite wrongly obtained. That can lead to all sorts of strains. Lord Denning, whom I have already quoted, as it were, opening up the floodgates in this area, had this to say about the appeal of these six people:
      </para>
      <para>
       If the six men fail-
      </para>
      <para>
       he is not talking about this particular procedure going on now but an earlier appeal-
      </para>
      <para>
       it will mean that much time and money will have been expended by many people for no good purpose. If the six men win, it will mean that the police were guilty of perjury, and that they were guilty of violence and threats, that the confessions were involuntary . . . and that the convictions were erroneous. That would mean the Home Secretary would either have to recommend they be pardoned or he would have to remit the case to the Court of Appeal. This is such an appalling vista that every sensible person in the land would say: It cannot be right these actions should go any further.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a matter of considerable concern that, where it appears that these confessions-which led to the gaoling of these people for many years-have come under suspicion, a judge of Lord Denning's eminence should say something like that. It is a sign that in giving powers to police and in allowing questioning by them to take place, we have to be very careful to circumscribe them so that this sort of thing should not happen. I should say in passing that Lord Denning later modified, if not withdrew from, that statement. No doubt I will hear arguments from fellow members of the Committee, but it is a matter of considerable concern that the traditional rights that we all enjoy in this society should not be modified or taken away in a way that makes this society different from what it is.

       Senator Hill mentioned the Coldrey committee in Melbourne. I must join with Senator Hill and say that the Coldrey committee did great work. I note that Mr Coldrey, QC, is now His Honour Mr Justice Coldrey of the Victorian Supreme Court, having been properly elevated to that position last month. Of course, he is very eminent in law and no doubt will grace the bench in that worthy and great State. That report was made by a committee and all committees, hopefully, are able to compromise. The fact that a reasonable time was agreed to does not mean that we should blindly, or even readily, follow that line.

       This important piece of legislation raises these issues. As presently advised, I can see much merit in a four-hour period capable of being extended by another eight hours on a proper application to a magistrate or, in certain circumstances, to a justice of the peace. That four hours will be recorded by video. It seems to me that an interview which runs for four hours will probably provide very good evidence to a jury or a judge about the way in which the alleged confession was made and the weight that should be given to it. But as I say, I stand ready to be convinced. I see that I will be followed by Senator Spindler, who has a great ability to influence the way I think; Senator Tambling; Senator Reid, who has also done much work in this area; and then, of course, the Minister.

        —The Senate today is debating the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990. This Bill is an important piece of legislation, as Senator Cooney and Senator Hill have already indicated. It deals with the conflict that arises between, on the one hand, depriving citizens of their liberty and, on the other hand, the obvious need to allow law enforcement agencies to do their jobs well and without impediment.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The starting point for this debate is that in a democratic society no-one should be placed under detention merely because law enforcement officers have a suspicion that the person may have broken the law. The 1986 case of Williams v. the Queen confirms the common law position that a person may not be arrested simply for questioning by the police but must be brought before a magistrate or judge as soon as practicable. In other words, there must be good cause for the arrest and the police officer could be subject to penalties for false arrest if he cannot show such good cause for the arrest.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have said, this raises the competing public policy requirements that law enforcement officers must be afforded the opportunity to question a suspect, if only to establish whether prosecution is justified and should proceed. Both before and since the 1986 High Court ruling in the Williams case, the dilemma posed by this issue has been examined and reported upon on numerous occasions. In 1975 the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended that a precise time limit should be set for police custodial investigation and that this should be four hours with provision for dead time. Dead time is time not actually spent in questioning the person concerned but in arranging for legal representation, allowing him or her rest periods and other matters that are purely incidental to the questioning process.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1989 the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law suggested allowing six hours in the case of serious offences. The Bill before the chamber has the lower limit and also includes the various safeguards recommended by Gibbs and canvassed by the Law Reform Commission; and I will return to these.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Bill seeks to create a balance between the two competing demands by providing in proposed new section 23c that the investigation period begins when the person is arrested and ends `at a time thereafter that is reasonable' subject to a maximum of two hours for people aged under 18, for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, and four hours for all others. Thus we have the notion of reasonable time even in this Bill, which places an outer limit on that time. Even at this stage it may be useful to compare this limit with the six-hour limit introduced in Victoria in 1984, which remained in force until 1988. I will go into some more detail at a later stage but it was found that in 152 out of some 42,000 cases at that time the police required in excess of six hours for questioning people they had arrested. In other words, even when the six-hour limit was in force, for fewer than 0.5 per cent of cases that time was not sufficient. It was a very small percentage.
      </para>
      <para>
       We should also note at this stage that those six hours did not provide for so-called dead time. At that time, the six hours covered the total time that a person was in custody for questioning purposes. It would be useful to advert to the fact that one of the last proposed sections in this Bill provides for compulsory tape recording of interviews. A survey carried out by the Tasmanian Police Force found that this reduces the actual questioning time by two-thirds.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we compare the four hours that this Bill provides as an upper limit with the time available in other jurisdictions, such as the Victorian jurisdiction, we are looking at an equivalent of some 12 hours or more that this Bill provides as an outer limit. I think this matter should be taken into account when we debate whether the cap is necessary or reasonable. In saying that, I am very conscious of the arguments put up by the Australian Federal Police, which I will deal with in some greater detail.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bill provides for some quite extensive exclusions for so-called dead time. They include the time required to convey the person from the place of arrest to the nearest premises where the investigation is being carried out and the time required to communicate with a legal practitioner, friend, relative, parent, guardian or other person and also to allow such people to come to the place where the questioning is taking place. I do not intend to go through all of them, but these few examples will give some indication of the quite extensive matters covered in the exclusions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because I know that Senator Tambling intends to advert to some correspondence from the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, I point out that in his letter the Minister confuses a little the matters that are covered by dead time and the matters that are simply taken into account when the extension of time is being considered. He complains that in the provisions for dead time the Bill does not provide for time taken for medical examinations or for time taken to allow the person to rest. Clearly that is wrong because both matters are contained in the Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       He then suggests that the number and complexity of matters to be investigated and the time taken to interview available witnesses and so on also should be included in dead time. But those criteria go to the question of whether or not the time should be extended by up to eight hours on application to a magistrate or a justice of the peace as the Bill currently provides.
      </para>
      <para>
       In considering this Bill and bearing in mind its importance, I have engaged in considerable and extensive consultation with people who are concerned either as practitioners or as observers. As I have mentioned before, this included the Australian Federal Police (AFP). I wish now to express my appreciation for the assiduousness with which it has provided me with material and for the arguments which were cogently and capably put forward.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was told yesterday by a journalist that the AFP nonetheless is somewhat disappointed with our stance, which is one of basic support for the Bill, and that it intends to campaign politically against the Australian Democrats as a result of the stance I have indicated we will take. If that is true-I have not been able to verify it although I tried to contact its office this morning but to no avail-I would say that would have to be a matter of regret. I believe that the AFP, in common with other public servants, is not entitled under our system to become politically active if it is unhappy with a particular decision that is arrived at by a political party or indeed by Parliament. I trust that it is a misunderstanding and can be cleared up.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also wish to express at this stage some regret about statements issued by Mr Bill Stefaniak, a member of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. By the words he has used in his own statement, he has indicated that he has not fully appreciated the matters canvassed by this Bill and the issues concerned, and I find his statements somewhat insulting.
      </para>
      <para>
       We talked to a whole range of people, including practitioners at the criminal bar, mainly in Victoria, and the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties and, in a number of cases, the people we talked to belonged to both categories. We also spoke to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Coldrey, who has already been mentioned by both Senator Cooney and Senator Hill as having been the author of the Coldrey report which in Victoria was responsible for initiating the change from the-six hour limit to a reasonable time, which is currently in force. I shall return to that matter later.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have also spoken to the Australian Legal Aid Office in Darwin and the Aboriginal Legal Aid Office in Alice Springs. As well, we have spoken to people connected with a campaign for prevention of custodial deaths who have been in constant contact with the evidence that is being provided by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In all of these consultations the issues that we were dealing with led many people to say that there were arguments to be had for both positions. In fact, there was a time, when I started out on this investigation, when I thought reasonable time was `reasonable'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some members of the Bar put forward the view that it took the pressure off a police interview, that people could have their case investigated at a more leisurely pace and without constraints and that, ultimately, in many cases this may work in favour of the person being detained. As the consultations progressed, however, I became convinced that while it was important to pay some attention to `reasonable time'-and I will ask the Minister to confirm that the criteria for reasonable time, although not specifically mentioned in this Bill, will in fact be used in the context of this Bill-the time that is allowed for questioning before people are brought before a magistrate is more usefully defined with an upper limit to give certainty to the police who do not, as they do in a reasonable time situation, have to second-guess what a court subsequently might think of their decision, whether a particular time or circumstance was reasonable, and who may possibly lose their case. It was also put to us with quite some force-particularly from people who deal with Aboriginal people and others who are culturally, or for other reasons, not familiar with our legal system and with police procedures-that there must be some protection at some stage where the process can be interrupted, if only to have it brought before a magistrate.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn to the legislation that was in force in Victoria and is now in force through section 460 of the Crimes Act. I intend to lean fairly heavily on the evidence that we have been able to collect in that area because, as I said, a lot of the other evidence that we have collected is based very much on people's perceptions of how that conflict between two competing public policy principles can best be resolved. I think in that situation we should, as far as possible, go back to the experience which, fortunately, we are provided with in the Victorian context.
      </para>
      <para>
       The major concern of the police who provided evidence to the Coldrey committee, which was investigating whether the six-hour limit brought into operation in 1984 should be changed, was that the six-hour limit was `hampering effective police investigation of crime'. Yet, as I have mentioned before, some 99.5 per cent of interrogations were completed within the six-hour limit. So it is a little difficult, it seems to me, to sustain that particular argument.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also on the record that of the 330 returns which were made at the time of police requests for an extension of time 168 actually took less than six hours. The police obviously made an application, but then found, when it came to the point, that they did not need to use that time. Of the 330 returns, 152 took from six to 12 hours, 10 took from 12 to 18 hours and none took more than 18 hours. So 162 exceeded six hours.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should repeat the point that I made before: in this particular case all interviews were carried out by the time-honoured method of a police person asking a question, taking note of the answer and typing it-usually by the two-finger method-before proceeding to the next question. This Bill makes provision for taping and we have the evidence that it can reduce and-according to a survey carried out in Tasmania-has reduced the time by two-thirds. It is worth noting too that as a result of these statistical investigations the Coldrey committee found that there was no statistical basis for suggesting that section 460 necessarily impedes police investigations of crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       The committee went further and looked at whether there was, in fact, a case on a qualitative basis. The only two points-they are really one point-which are relevant to the current Bill were that the police may be impeded `where investigations are being made into complex crimes and multiple offences' and `where the continuity of interviews is broken during the investigation of complex crimes and multiple offences'.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have obviously addressed that point in our considerations and have come to the conclusion that since the four hours nominal time nominated in the Bill, in fact, is something like 12 hours, at least 12 hours-compared with the experience that we were told about in Victoria where a six-hour cap applied-that aspect is well and truly taken care of, particularly in view of the fact that a further eight hours can be obtained by application to a magistrate.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now wish to move to a number of amendments that the Australian Democrats will move to this Bill because in assessing the main thrust of the Bill we found that in some areas the Bill could be improved. I advert first of all to the persons who under proposed section 23C are put into the upper limit of two hours category. At the moment, they are people under 18 and Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. We believe that to these two categories we should add persons who are not fluent in English, illiterate persons and persons of diminished responsibility. I would suggest that these additions are pretty self-explanatory.
      </para>
      <para>
       I might at this point also advert to the arguments that were brought up against the inclusion of Aboriginal people in the two-hour limit, claiming that it was discrimination on racial grounds. Surely this is a case of positive discrimination because we are dealing with people who are not familiar, culturally, with our legal system, who are not familiar with our methods of police interrogation and, as those of us who have been fortunate enough to have had substantial contact with Aboriginal people would know, who have a tendency to want to please people and to answer in a way in which the questioner has indicated he would like to have an answer provided. Taking all these factors into account, it would seem a necessary safeguard to ensure that before such a person is subjected to lengthy and very often intimidating interrogation-and I am not here suggesting that the intimidation is intentional necessarily-we should allow a magistrate to determine whether further interrogation should take place.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would also advert to the point made in this connection that, because Aboriginal people are perhaps more hesitant and may require an interpreter, we should, in actual fact, provide more time. It seems to us, on the basis of the evidence that is being provided from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and other people who are in daily contact with Aboriginal people and have experience of the legal system, that this consideration is far outweighed by the necessity to afford them some protection. If further time is required as a result of the need to interpret what they are saying, clearly the extension time on application is available.

       There is a list in the Bill which provides for the establishment of interview friends and interpreters to cover those cases where the person in custody does not have a personal friend whom he or she can ask to be present at the interview. We believe that serving police officers should be excluded from that list because of the obvious possibility of their taking a professional interest in the proceedings which could be detrimental to the person being questioned. This is, of course, no reflection on police officers. It is simply a reflection of the reality of what happens in outback areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       We believe that the tape recording provisions need to be strengthened. While the cautioning, questioning, admissions and so on are very often done on a verbal and written basis in the first instance, we believe that they should be repeated and tape recorded at the first opportunity. At the moment the Bill simply provides that this should be done where practicable. We feel that while this may apply in the first instance it should be picked up on a subsequent occasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       We believe that when an application is made for an extension of the investigating period, this application should be made to magistrates and/or bail justices only. We would prefer to see justices of the peace excluded from this function.

       We would argue that the use of lie detectors and polygraphs should be prohibited. We would see that there are some consequential amendments which need to be introduced in the Bill resulting from the inclusion of the additional categories that I have mentioned in the first instance.

      <para>
       Let me conclude by saying that the Bill as it stands, with all its safeguards-particularly if our amendments are introduced-could well serve as a model Bill for the States because ultimately we should move to a position where the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Territories coincide in their provisions with the procedures followed in the States. In that context, I was pleased to see that the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, in its discussion paper for community consultation entitled Police Powers of Arrest and Detention, suggested:

The coalition will not be opposing the Bill at the second reading stage, although it has very serious concerns with some aspects of it, and I will be supporting the coalition's move to have this piece of legislation referred to committees for further consultation and consideration.

       This Bill, firstly, seeks to confer upon police the power to detain for the purpose of questioning or investigation and, secondly, having gone that far, it seeks to lay down precise limits upon the manner in which such a power should be exercised. Bearing in mind the fundamental importance of liberty of the person as the cornerstone of our common law rights, any interference with this liberty must be subject to strict safeguards which, fortunately, this Bill provides.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is arguable that the present common law rule that arrested persons cannot be detained for the purpose of questioning is an impediment to effective law enforcement. It is perhaps desirable that police have the power to detain arrested persons in order to carry out further investigations so that they can settle the appropriate charges. The law relating to arrest, that police can arrest persons only on the basis of reasonable suspicion, provides a safeguard against arbitrary detention.
      </para>
      <para>
       The three principles in contention are: firstly, whether police should have the power to detain arrested persons for the purpose of questioning; secondly, whether it is necessary or desirable to have separate Commonwealth legislation to govern detention of persons arrested for Federal offences or whether State or Territory law should continue to apply; and, thirdly, assuming that the answers to these questions are in the affirmative, whether the detention period should be governed by what is considered a reasonable amount of time or fixed by prescribed maximum time limits subject to an extension of time procedure and, if so, what these time limits should be.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to expand on maximum time limits that the Government has currently placed with respect to this legislation. Provision is currently made for a pre-charge custodial period for a person under arrest in relation to a Commonwealth offence. Such period is not to exceed two hours if the person is under 18 years of age, an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander; or four hours, in any other case.
      </para>
      <para>
       Two points should be raised at this stage. The first involves the complex nature under which the Australian Federal Police operate their investigations, which may require lengthy sessions of questioning. The second involves the blatant discrimination of the length of time of interview between two categories of Australian citizens, which categories have already been mentioned.

      </para>
      <para>
       There are a number of features of the Bill which are of concern to myself and the Territory law enforcement authorities. These concerns are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The fixed periods of 2 and 4 hours are unrealistically short. The reduction of the period for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders fails to take into account the reality of the situation. As has been the experience in this jurisdiction the detention time required for an Aboriginal suspect is often far greater than the norm. For instance a great deal of time can be taken, particularly where electronic recording is involved, in explaining the caution to the interviewee and getting them to demonstrate, on tape, that the effect of the caution is clearly understood.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Bill makes no provision for delays occasioned in the interview situation by the use of an interpreter. Interpreters are frequently used in this jurisdiction particularly during the interview of Aboriginal suspects.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Section 23c (3) (a) states that `within' the investigation period, the person must be released (or otherwise dealt with). This requirement ignores the delays often encountered in watch-house processing.
      </para>
      <para>
       During a busy period it may be some time before watch-house staff can charge and bail a person. It is not unusual to have a delay of some hours, particularly when there are conditions set for bail, e.g. a surety or large cash sum.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The standard of proof in Section 23b (2) (a), i.e. `sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed a Commonwealth offence' appears too onerous.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) It is my view that the Bill places too much emphasis on `questioning' at the expense of `investigation'. The fact that `questioning' is defined to include only investigative practices in which the person participates would appear to fail to take into account the exigencies of criminal investigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) The `dead time' provision Section 23c (b) when compared to a similar provision in the Northern Territory, Section 138 of the Police Administration Act seems unduly restrictive.
      </para>
      <para>
       Matters which are taken into account in our Section 138 but which do not appear in Section 23c (6) are:
      </para>
      <para>
       - the number and complexity of matters to be investigated;
      </para>
      <para>
       - the time taken to interview available witnesses (and the victim);
      </para>
      <para>
       - the need for members to assess relevant material in preparation for interview;
      </para>
      <para>
       - the number of people who need to be questioned during the period of detention;
      </para>
      <para>
       - the need to visit the crime scene/s;
      </para>
      <para>
       - the time taken in awaiting the completion of forensic investigation or procedures;
      </para>
      <para>
       - the time taken for a medical examination; and
      </para>
      <para>
       - the time taken to allow the person to rest.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is felt that the exclusion of these matters will severely restrict police investigations in the following ways:
      </para>
      <para>
       - police with no real knowledge of what may be a complete matter may be forced to conduct an interview. This could also act to the detriment of the suspect;
      </para>
      <para>
       - there is no time allowed for interview preparation which is essential when electronically recording an interview;
      </para>
      <para>
       - the fact that time is not allowed for a medical examination;
      </para>
      <para>
       - the inability to interview witnesses, particularly the victim, may severely diminish the value of the interview with the suspect.
      </para>
      <para>
       (g) Section 23c (6) (a) which requires a person to be taken to the nearest premises may affect the quality of the investigation. For example, there was a recent case in the Northern Territory where a suspect was apprehended in Alice Springs some time after the commission of an offence. The offence having been committed in Darwin. The investigating officers were in Darwin. The suspect at the `nearest premises' Alice Springs Police Station.
      </para>
      <para>
       (h) Section 23c (6) (f) refers to `intoxication' but the Bill fails to define the term.
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Section 23c (5) which relates to the 48 hour limitation in my view would unduly hamper police investigations. For example, where a person is arrested for a serious assault and the victim dies shortly after the offender is released (or otherwise dealt with). If the maximum period has been used, are police to allow the offender to remain at large?
      </para>
      <para>
       The main failing of Section 23c appears to me to be that it disregards the severity and complexity of some offences and the number of cases where multiple offences or co-offenders are involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       (j) Section 23d which deals with the extension of the investigation period appears unsatisfactory. The absolute maximum of 10-12 hours would not allow for police to properly investigate offences.
      </para>
      <para>
       (k) In the Northern Territory many remote areas do not have telephone facilities. Section 23g presupposes that there are means readily available by which communication can be made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (l) Another major concern relates to the mandatory electronic recording of interviews. The Northern Territory Police Force now routinely audio and for major crimes audio and video interviews. However it was not made mandatory through legislation. Under this Bill interviews carried out in the field may have to cease. Confessional evidence and admissions may be excluded.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Northern Territory admissions will not automatically be excluded if there are not facilities available or a technical failure has occurred.
      </para>
      <para>
       The inflexibility of this legislation can be seen from this example. A suspect is being interviewed for possession and use of heroin. During the interview admissions are made as to the importation of heroin. The interview was conducted in accordance with Northern Territory law and practice. Even though the confession was voluntary and electronically recorded under this Bill it would be excluded at trial. For the Northern Territory charges it would be necessary to excise the portion dealing with the importation from the recording.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Northern Territory recently enacted amendments to the Police Administration Act. These amendments, Sections 137 and 138, dealt with pre-trial detention. A copy of the amendment is attached. The amendment was suggested to the Government by a committee comprised of members of the bar, Law Society, prosecutions and judiciary. The committee, after examining the experience of other jurisdictions, chose the `reasonable period' test. Following passage of the amendments a Police Powers Review Committee was formed to monitor the effect of the legislation. A copy of the committee's first and second interim reports are attached.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amongst other reasons it was seen that the `reasonable period' test gave flexibility to the police force investigating crimes on behalf of society and left it to the experts, the courts, to determine whether the time the person was detained was reasonable.

       My colleague, the Hon. Daryl Manzie, M.L A., has written to you to explain in detail the difficulties that passage of this Bill would create in the Northern Territory. As Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services, I share his concern and fully endorse the comments that he has provided to you, as well as the additional information recently provided to Senator Tambling.

       This Bill is not in the best interests of the administration of justice in the Northern Territory, and possibly elsewhere. I urge the Opposition to use its influence to seek a withdrawal of the Bill to allow time for an examination of the Territory's experience with legislation including a `reasonable period' detention provision.

        —I thank the Senate. Both letters emphasise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people often require more time to interview, not less. Mr Manzie's letter goes further to describe the practicalities that are often necessary to interview an Aboriginal person. Detailed explanation of the electronic devices is necessary and interpreters are often required, which delays the interviewing process.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Mr Manzie points out further inefficiencies in this Bill in relation to the Northern Territory, one of which refers to the `dead time' provision of proposed section 23c (6). When compared with a similar provision in the Northern Territory, section 138 of the Police Administration Act would appear unduly restrictive. Matters that are taken into account in the Northern Territory but are not considered in this legislation include the number and complexity of the matters to be investigated, the time taken to interview available witnesses and the victim, the need for members to assess relevant material in preparation for an interview, the number of people who need to be questioned during the period of detention, the need to visit the crimes and scenes, time taken in awaiting the completion of forensic investigation or procedures, the time taken for medical examination and the time taken to allow the person to rest.
      </para>
      <para>
       It would seem that the exclusion of these matters will severely restrict the ability of police investigation. The police, with no real knowledge of what may be a complete matter, may be forced to conduct an interview; there is no time for interview preparation; there is no time allowed for the medical examination; and the inability to interview witnesses, particularly the victim, may severely diminish the value of the interview with the suspect.
      </para>
      <para>
       These inefficiencies have been raised not only by the Northern Territory Government Ministers but also by the Northern Territory Police Association, and the Australian Federal Police Association, in particular the Northern Territory Branch, which has drawn to my attention two case scenarios that would be severely hampered by such legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Scenario 1: a foreign national was arrested after attempting to import approximately 7.5 kilograms of heroin. The initial interview lasted nine hours, after which the person was given eight hours rest and then interviewed for a further three hours. Although allowed by the legislation to apply for an extension to the specified four hours, any interruption in a case such as this will deny any chance of a controlled delivery, leaving no options for investigations into co-offenders and organisers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Scenario 2: in an investigation into a complex fraud matter, involving multiple offenders, the main offender was interviewed for 12 hours, during which it was required for the offender to be shown innumerable documents. Given the time saving of taped interviews, it is probable that the interview could still have taken six to seven hours, involving the suspension of the interview to allow for an application for extension of time.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second point I wish to raise regarding the fixed time period is the blatant discrimination between two lengths of time between different sectors and sections of the community. I understand that we are all sensitive to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. However, I think the two-hour limit is quite unrealistic for police investigations. When I was in Alice Springs recently I had an extensive discussion and toured through the new facilities at the police station. The implementation of video surveillance of prison cells in Alice Springs and throughout the Northern Territory has gone a long way in providing suitable holding conditions for Aboriginal people.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government drafting of different lengths of time for interviews between two categories of Australian citizens makes a mockery of the Government agenda to advance Aboriginal Australians from their current plight. The proposal to have a two-hour pre-charge custodial period discriminates against Aboriginal people, particularly the innocent who often need extra time for interpretation, simple English explanations and medical attention. The Government has a total disregard for the very obvious cultural and social differences that Aboriginal people face. This can only work as reverse discrimination and this issue was canvassed quite widely in the House of Representatives by Mr Peacock. There is no doubt in my mind that the time restriction of four hours will become an increasing problem affecting investigation into Commonwealth offences.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another area that causes me some concern is the lack of consultation by the Government with regard to this piece of legislation. After considering the recommendations of the Gibbs committee and representations from the Australian Federal Police, the former Attorney-General opted for the position that a reasonable time period for questioning apply as well as other procedural safeguards. The present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has reversed that decision, might I say, without consultation with the Australian Federal Police Association and State or Territory governments to which these changes will impact on Federal, State and Territory police forces when investigating Federal offences. The consultation process has excluded the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr McAulay, in the processes leading up to the preparation of the legislation. In a letter dated 16 November 1990 from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Association, the Commissioner says:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the new position has been reached by a review process which did not involve further consultation with my officers or myself.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is amazing that such a Bill has been introduced into this House which contains reforms affecting law enforcement agencies around the country responsible for its administration, without obtaining the views of these associations.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I support the basic principles of the legislation, as it seeks to improve checks and balances in relation to pre-charge detention procedures. I would, however, put on the record my strong reservations in relation to the extent of consultation leading up to the Bill's introduction into this House and the fixed time detentions which are not only discriminatory but also unrealistic in remote locations of Australia.

         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to the statement by the Treasurer in his 1990 Budget Speech that the forecast surplus of $8.1 billion `maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon in the fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt'. I also refer the Minister to the Treasurer's admission on the Sunday program three days ago that the 1991 Budget could finish up in deficit, but that, if so, `it would be no calamity'. In light of these statements and the huge January balance of payments deficit of $1.6 billion-the second largest in almost a year-announced today, I ask the Minister firstly: how does he reconcile these seemingly totally contradictory statements? Secondly, does the Treasurer's statement on the Sunday program represent a major change in the Government's economic policy stance? Thirdly, given that the Government has completely lost control of fiscal policy, what policy weapons does it now propose to use to tackle Australia's fundamental economic problems, including its chronic balance of payments and debt problems, and the recession that the Treasurer said we were not going to have but then had to have?

         —Firstly, Senator Short would be aware that, since the Treasurer made his statement in the Budget Speech, there has been the onset of a recession in Australia. Of course, in terms of the Budget surplus there are enormous cyclical effects of a downturn in the economy of this current order. The first cyclical effect comes from growing unemployment, which we have seen in the past few months. The second cyclical effect comes from the reduction in corporate profits and the corporate profit share of the revenue side of the Budget. That should not be news to Senator Short.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Short has related a number of issues into one. What the Treasurer has clearly been saying, and was said on the Sunday program, is that the decline in the surplus is due to the impact of the recession on outlays and revenue as well as the effect of the wage tax trade-off, which I think was universally accepted as a sensible thing to do in terms of inflationary anticipations. Of course, there have been two other items which have affected the Budget surplus-our participation in the Gulf war and the compensation for woolgrowers; also, some bits of legislation which would have brought in substantial revenue but which were rejected by the Opposition in the Senate. Those are the matters which, in addition to cyclical factors, have effected the downgrading of the surplus. The Opposition knows that to be perfectly true.

There was a lot of anecdotal evidence about the severity of the downturn in the Australian economy, but very few figures which supported it and very few economists or officials in the Treasury who understood precisely what was happening. I think I have answered the question in terms of the limited understanding of the Opposition, and I have nothing more to add.

         —As the Prime Minister and I both made clear in public statements at the time, Australia very deeply regrets the seizure of power in Thailand on 23 February by the armed forces leadership, overthrowing the democratically elected Government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan. Our concerns have, of course, been conveyed formally to the Thai authorities. We emphasised, in so communicating, our wish to see human rights observed and democratic government quickly restored.

        The military leadership, which has adopted the title of the National Peacekeeping Council, has dissolved parliament, abrogated the constitution and declared martial law, with military courts replacing criminal courts. Bans have been imposed on meetings of more than five people and on any public political gatherings. Total press censorship was originally imposed but has later been relaxed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Government remains concerned that former Prime Minister Chatichai and former Deputy Prime Minister Arthit Kamlang-ek remain in detention. Thai officials formally advised us following the coup of the military leadership's assurances that political power would be returned to the people within a short period, and that human rights would be fully respected.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have to say that the interim constitution which was promulgated on 1 March does not offer much encouragement in this respect. Regrettably, it incorporates provisions which entrench the ultimate authority of the military leadership, even after the formation of an interim civilian government. The National Peacekeeping Council retains its role as ultimate decision-maker, and the constitution invests it and the interim government it has appointed with arbitrary powers to deal with national security threats. It is also a matter of concern that the interim constitution allows for the delay of elections for up to 14 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        A civilian Prime Minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, has been appointed by the National Peacekeeping Council. He will now appoint an interim cabinet and a national legislative assembly, and this assembly will, we are told, draft a new permanent constitution. I note that Prime Minister Anand has spoken of the urgency of returning to parliamentary government and lifting martial law. I simply say that the Australian Government would be most concerned if the military authority's assurances of an early return to elected parliamentary government were not honoured. We also look to the military authorities and their civilian appointees to comply fully with internationally accepted human rights standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Government has decided that we should continue our existing relationship with Thailand for the time being, subject to close and continuing review of the actual human rights situation on the ground and, of course, the prompt restoration of democratic government.

         —Honourable senators will be aware that between Christmas and New Year the Legislative Council of the Parliament of Western Australia was reconvened in order to enable that State to join the other jurisdictions around Australia in ensuring that there is adequate regulation of companies and securities so as to provide a setting where investment, both from domestic and overseas sources, can be confidently put into the business and trading commercial sectors in Australia. That has been very welcome. As a result of that, the ASC was able to open a business centre in Perth on 2 January, which has been using temporary accommodation provided by the Western Australian Corporate Affairs Department. However, yesterday a new business centre was opened. I had a look at it a couple of weeks ago whilst it was being fitted out. It will provide a very handsome facility for the provision of service to the Western Australian business community.

        From my conversation with Mr Murray Allen, the Western Australian Regional Commissioner of the Australian Securities Commission at the time, I know that he has been delighted with the response of the Western Australian business community to the setting up of the business office and the regional office functions of the Australian Securities Commission in Perth. It appears to have been well accepted by the professional community, the business community-lawyers, accountants and those involved in business and commercial life in Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also he informed me that preparation for the convening of a regional liaison committee is well under way. He has written to some 15 major business and professional groups and has invited them to put forward names of appropriate persons who might join this liaison committee. As I have always emphasised in this place during the passage of the legislation, this is a most important function to be performed by this liaison committee. It has to ensure that, in the outer regions of Australia, away from the business and commerce in the south-eastern mainland, there is adequate sensitivity of the Australian Securities Commission to local regional business requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Allen informed me that he intends to invite approximately 15 people to join that committee. He expects the first meeting to be held early in April. It is at about that time that the new regional office will be occupied. I believe that at that time we will see that the ASC operations in Western Australia will satisfy the business and professional groups which have a very real interest in ensuring that, whilst the local operations are sensitive to their local needs, they recognise that they are part of a larger network Australia-wide, which the ASC and this Parliament now takes responsibility for.

That claim, coming from a conservative government, does sit oddly with the comparison between the performance of this Government and the previous Fraser Government. Under this Government industrial disputation declined by 61 per cent over the amount which used to apply under the former administration.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I believe that the claim is misleading and that can be demonstrated. But I should first say that it is true that Mr Greiner told the New South Wales Parliament on Thursday, 21 February-its first day back for 1991-that industrial disputation in New South Wales declined by almost 16 per cent while in the Labor States there had been an annual increase of 13.4 per cent. From what was said it is clear that Mr Greiner was referring to industrial disputation figures for the year ended October 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        What Mr Greiner did not say was that New South Wales has the highest rate of industrial disputation of any State in Australia-a rate of 247 working days lost per 1,000 employees in the year to October 1990. That rate is 27 per cent higher than the Australian average of 194 working days lost per 1,000 employees. It is higher than Tasmania, with 64, Queensland with 101, Western Australia with 183, Victoria with 205, and South Australia with 218. I remind the Senate that the figure in New South Wales is 247. It appears that Mr Greiner arrived at his figure of an annual decline of 16 per cent for New South Wales because in October 1989 New South Wales was in an even worse position than it is now; its position in 1989 was 44 per cent higher than the national average rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also, I think, statistically illiterate to make the comparisons he did. He summed the rate of annual disputation for each Labor State, averaged those figures, and then found another rate of change. Using the same logic to arrive at the Australian unemployment rate, Mr Greiner would sum the individual rates of each State and then divide by six. This, of course, is a nonsense.
       </para>
       <para>
        The latest figures for November 1990, released on 1 March, still show that New South Wales has the worst rate of industrial disputation of any State-277 working days lost per 1,000 employees, 32 per cent higher than the national average of 210.

I must say as someone who during his eight years as a divisional officer with the St John Ambulance Brigade carted more than his fair share of dead motorbike riders off the road-usually in more than one piece, I must say-I am very pleased that the Government has decided to press ahead with this proposal despite significant opposition, unfortunately, from some of the riders associations. Around 270 motorcycle riders and passengers were killed in Australia last year and about 10 times as many would have been seriously injured.
        </para>

        Last December the Minister advised me that he had taken a decision to introduce an Australian design rule which will require, from 1 March next year, all new motorcycles to be wired so that once the engine is running the low beam headlamp or running lights will automatically turn on. The rule will apply only to new motorcycles. The decision was taken after a very thorough review of the evidence and extensive consultation with motorcycle representatives and State road safety authorities. The Government has no intention of resiling from that decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many motorcycle crashes involve a car driver who fails to react to the presence of a motorbike rider. I can certainly attest to that. There is strong research evidence that use of daytime lights increases the visibility and noticeability of motorcycle riders. Up to 70 per cent of riders themselves already choose to use daytime lights for safety reasons. It is estimated that an increase in use of daytime lights to 90 per cent of motorcycle riders would reduce the number of serious motorcycle crashes by about 3 per cent. This is a saving of about 10 lives and 100 serious injuries a year, and a much larger number of less serious crashes. The saving to the community in medical costs, lost earnings and property damage is estimated at $24m a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government was aware, when this decision was taken, of the concerns expressed by representatives of motorcycle rider groups. The Minister is disappointed that they have been unable to accept the decision that offers a worthwhile safety benefit to the motorcycle community. It has become plain that the opposition to this measure stems largely from a libertarian view that riders should be free to make their own choices about risks and safety.
       </para>
       <para>
        Without continuing with the brief that the Minister has given me, I must say that that would be an acceptable and supportable view if, of course, these people then had to bear the cost of the accidents they have. Of course they do not. I strongly support the decision taken by the Government and reiterate for the benefit of Senator Zakharov and the Senate that the Government will not resile from implementing this decision.

         —There have been some reports in newspapers and I think also on Victorian radio in respect of this matter. Those claims are unsubstantiated, and they cannot be substantiated. The Government has been concerned and is concerned about this particular issue, and it has acted to redress any problems that may have occurred in the past. It has incorporated a national set of client service standards which set goals as to the turnaround time for the processing of applications. One of these goals is that 80 per cent of applications should receive an initial response to the application within 21 days. In terms of the monitoring of that goal each student centre, and the Minister's Department nationally, monitors the performance against these client service standards. In monitoring the performance, we find that the Department has exceeded those goals, and exceeded them by a substantial margin. Something like 90 per cent of 1991 applicants have received a response within 21 days. This is significantly above last year's turnaround time, when the figure was 70 per cent having a turnaround time within the goals set by the Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This substantial improvement is in light of the fact that there has been an increase-about 16 per cent so far-in the number of applications received for Austudy. So there has been a major improvement. The goals set have been met and surpassed. I think it is fair to say this has happened for a number of reasons: first, the adoption of management practices; secondly, the introduction of innovations such as the simplification of the scheme itself; and, thirdly, simplification of application forms for continuing students. Those three measures in themselves have added substantially to improving standards and turnaround times.

        I should also mention that students who find themselves in financial difficulty may be granted urgent payments either through immediate processing of their claims or through access to counter checks.

He probably understands that his claim was wrong. Payments are made as soon as possible after applications are received.

        As members of the European Parliament will be well aware, from the sorts of noises made to them during their visit to this country, Australia will not in any way resile from continuing to press through all available and appropriate opportunities the very strongly held position that we do adopt about the impropriety, inappropriateness and counter-productiveness in terms of world trade and economic development of European agricultural support practices.

Is it within the Minister's knowledge that there has been pressure by both employer and employee organisations in Victoria-so far resisted by the Opposition there-to have its Parliament pass industrial relations legislation? Is there any, and if so what, ramification for the Federal industrial relations system if that legislation is not passed?

         —I am aware of the debate going on in Victoria about the industrial relations legislation and the sordid politics being played out by the Opposition in that State, which is threatening to block the passage of that legislation in the upper House. The Bill before the Victorian Parliament is an important one for Victoria from an industrial relations standpoint. It proposes to abolish the Conciliation and Arbitration Board system entirely and have all matters of industrial dispute settlement dealt with by the Commission. It proposes to divide the Commission into a panel structure much like that of the Federal Commission; it proposes to introduce provisions allowing for joint proceedings of the Commission with other commissions-in this case, namely the Federal Commission and the State Commission are operating jointly-and it establishes a two-tier industrial court system; that is, an industrial magistrates' court and a commission in court session structure.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of the stated aims of this legislation is to complement at a State level the provisions of the Federal Act. As a Federal Government we welcome the Victorian Government's proposal to do so. It is consistent with the moves going on all around Australia to blend the industrial relations systems of the States and the Commonwealth so there is a much greater interconnectibility about their decisions and a much greater rationality to the consumers of those decisions, be they employers or unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation arose from a classic tripartite consultative approach. It is in many respects a model of what State governments or Federal governments ought to do in order to see that a disputatious area like industrial relations is sorted out. The Government sat down with the unions and the employers in that State and came up with this body of legislation. It is strongly supported both by the Victorian Trades Hall Council and the Victorian employer organisations. The threat by Alan Brown, the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, to block this legislation therefore runs counter to what is a model of industrial relations conduct.
       </para>
       <para>
        To do so on the basis of political opportunism is disgraceful and irresponsible. Once again, it is an example of a conservative party trying to politicise industrial relations, to manipulate industrial relations for political purposes and for crass political gain. It is about time people woke up to the fact that this very sensitive field ought to be dealt with in the proper way-in the way in which the Victorian Government has dealt with it.

What has been the role of the Building Workers Industrial Union (BWIU) in this contract? Coupled with the fact that work on the garden was supposed to be finished by Christmas 1990 and that now, in March 1991, completion may be many months away, is this not yet another example of questionable management practices by the Minister's Department, practices which the Minister seems consistently unable and unwilling to address, or is this just another make-work project being engineered by the Government to counter spiralling unemployment?

         —If Senator Newman keeps quiet for a minute she will get the answer that I want to give her. The Commonwealth Office of Australian War Graves is currently constructing a garden of remembrance at the Rookwood Cemetery in New South Wales. It is estimated to cost $6m and is scheduled for completion within a few months. It will provide for 100,000 plaques; we know that aspect of it. The contract of $3.8m was let to a New South Wales proprietary limited company in August 1988. The anticipated completion date, as we also know, was supposed to have been July 1989. That company was Girvan Pty Limited. Progress in the first half of 1989 was extremely slow due to a combination of abnormally wet weather, brick supply problems, low productivity and severe industrial disputes. All that is very much on the record and has been on the record for some time. There is nothing new in that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The works were temporarily suspended on 4 July 1989 to allow the work to be redesigned to permit the incorporation of different bricks. The suspension was lifted in October 1989; the resumed work proceeded well, until Girvan went into receivership on 30 January 1990. After that another company was engaged to provide a temporary construction management service to enable work to continue and to avoid further industrial disputes. That firm was R.N. Cooper. It commenced work on the site on 16 February 1990, and I am informed that that work proceeded well until wet weather in April 1990 hampered progress. After that there have been considerations as to the financial costs. The Department of Finance approved an increase in authorisation of $6m after April 1990 in order to complete the work. A lump sum contract was signed with R.N. Cooper on 6 July 1990 and a contract completion date was set for September 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been overrun since then. R.N. Cooper has subsequently experienced delays resulting from wet weather combined with safety, industrial and some contractors' problems. That has resulted in progress being slower than usual. There must be some mystique on the other side in respect of this. There must be some expectation that the Opposition can stop the rain; that it can stop industrial disputes-in the public sector but not in the private sector. What we are talking about here is a situation which prevails whether the operation is conducted by a private sector company or by the public sector. In fact, in this particular instance, very clearly, Australian Construction Services is contracting with private sector organisations for them to complete the work.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of the specific question of $1.70, $2.60 or whatever per brick, I will find out for Senator Newman; but I ask her to recognise that what we have here is a contracting-out arrangement. It is one which is subject to the vicissitudes of weather and the economy; one that has been entered into in accordance with normal and acceptable contracting practices; and one that is proceeding despite difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those difficulties have been on the record for some time. I think it was last December or November that Senator Newman asked me about the same cemetery by a different aspect of questioning. I hope that this time she has her allegation right. I know that the last three times that Senator Newman and Senator Parer raised questions about this matter they got it wrong. In fact, at one stage Senator Newman alleged in the chamber that there was a toilet on a mezzanine floor when in fact there was no mezzanine floor in the building. I hope that Senator Newman is right this time. I will check it out and let her know.

On 21 February I questioned the Minister on the use by the Government of the term `working families' in its child-care media release to mean only those with both parents in the paid work force. The Minister responded that there is no discrimination against mothers not in the paid work force and that they can take advantage of the child-care places and the extension of fee relief to commercial centres. How does the Minister reconcile this statement with the fact that of total child-care funding by the Federal Government, the Government has actually reduced the percentage for the type of occasional child-care required by mothers not in the paid work force in pursuance of their devoted work for their families? Is the Minister not aware of the fact that his own Government has reduced that percentage from 1989-90, which was 6 per cent of the total, to this Budget of 4.1 per cent? In the interests of equity and in recognition of this marvellous work of mothers, will the Government consider the issue of vouchers to those mothers for that purpose?

        As to the Government's overall policy, particularly with the passage through this Parliament of the fee relief to commercial centres, I believe that particular matter took up a lot of time both in this chamber and in committee just before Christmas. There was evidence of the Government delivering on its promise to make fee relief available to families using previously unfunded commercial, employer provided and non-profit centres. That is just one example of the way in which this particular Government has increased the range of child-care services which are available to a range of Australian families and households including, of course, those situations where a mother chooses to not be part of the paid work force.

         —What I have said-in the interests of accuracy-is that a survey conducted over two years covering 4,500 managers of plants and union representatives in something like 2,500 workplaces in Australia, both big and small, covering all sorts of industry and geographically spread around Australia, and overseen for statistical accuracy by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, has reported that one of the features of Australian workplaces is a lack of the infrastructure necessary to support enterprise bargaining. That is what I have said.

       <para>
        I have indicated that that is a sobering finding from an objective survey for a Government like my own, which has argued in the current national wage case that a degree of enterprise flexibility should be provided, that the decentralised system should be devolved to some extent to the enterprise level and that the national wage case bench, when it brings down its decision, should prescribe guidelines for that enterprise negotiation. The key is that, if the infrastructure is not adequate to support a successful carrying off of those enterprise negotiations, the move to the new phase of industrial relations development in this country-to an enterprise phase-will be complicated.

This morning we had the release of the balance of payments figures for January. Once again, we have had another month where Australia has gone into debt to the rest of the world to the tune of not much short of $2 billion. In seasonally adjusted terms, the balance of payments deficit for January was $1.6 billion; in unadjusted terms it was $1.9 billion.

       <para>
        I interpose to farewell Senator Button from the chamber, Senator Button being one of the key architects of the Government's failed policies. He is the Leader of the Government in the Senate but he is not even prepared to sit and listen to, let alone participate in, a debate of very considerable importance. Senator Button has ducked every such debate in this chamber this session and indeed in previous sessions. Today he has left Senator Cook as his key speaker. We all know, including from that ridiculous answer we just heard from Senator Cook in Question Time, what he can bring to this debate-nothing but gobbledegook and nonsense. I call on Senator Button as the responsible Minister-as the Leader of the Government in the Senate and as the Minister representing the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance-to take his responsibilities to this Senate, to this Parliament, much more seriously than he does.
       </para>
       <para>
        We as a nation are caught in a current account deficit rut of approximately $1.5 billion a month-month in, month out. This is despite the fact that we have the worst recession since the Second World War and arguably-if Senator Button's answer yesterday to Senator Chapman's question is correct, namely, that we are about to have a third successive quarter, and the fourth out of the last five quarters, of negative economic growth-the longest protracted period of negative economic growth that this country has had since the Great Depression. Despite that, imports are continuing to run at $180m a day, as they have in the last month. The current account deficit has been stuck at an enormously high figure-about $18 billion a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bottom line of all of that is that the current account deficit for this year looks like coming in at about 4 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). That is roughly in line with what was predicted at the time of the Budget. It is coming in at that figure despite the fact that unemployment may be running at 9 per cent or above-almost certainly above; well above the Budget forecast-and despite the fact that economic growth will be decidedly negative this financial year compared with the Budget estimates of a growth of 2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Economic Planning Advisory Council studies suggest that a current account deficit of this magnitude would mean that the foreign debt obligations of this nation would not be stabilised this century. That would mean that the Hawke Government would have to maintain high, and probably rising, real interest rates as we struggle to attract funds to cover our recurring current account deficits and face very strong competition for funds from abroad and further possible downgrading of our international credit rating.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today the international economic environment is a decidedly less positive and favourable environment for us than it was a year ago. The prospects of the export side of our balance of payments deteriorating are very strong indeed in the short term and may well continue into the longer term. Already export volumes have fallen. Commodity prices have eased in the face of that economic slowdown taking place overseas. That will simply compound the problems that we have as a nation in getting ourselves out of the dreadful mess that has been dug for us by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has stated that we need to get the current account deficit down to 2.5 per cent of GDP in order to stabilise our external debt by 1993. That would imply a current account deficit for this year of about $10 billion, not the $17 to $18 billion that now seems certain to be in prospect. The Treasurer needs to explain to the Parliament and to the Australian people just how the $6 billion to $7 billion-odd gap will come about and how it will be filled. Surely he does not propose to drive the economy even further and deeper into recession to meet that gap. However, given the policies of this Government, one could not be too sure of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The foreign debt figures are equally disturbing. The figures that were released last week for the end of December period show that foreign debt is now running at a gross figure of $165 billion and a net figure of $131 billion. That is equal to $7,800 for every man, woman and child in this country. The net interest that is payable on that debt as a ratio of our exports of goods and services continues to run at the staggeringly high rate of 20 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to look at the growth of foreign debt in this country over the past 20 years, particularly over the past 10 years, throughout most of which this Government has been in office. In 1969-70, only 20 years ago, our net foreign debt was $2 billion. Today our net foreign debt is $131 billion, about 65 times higher than it was only 20 years ago. Twenty years ago the net interest payable on that debt equalled 0.4 per cent. The net foreign debt as a proportion of our gross domestic product was 6.5 per cent. Today that figure is 33.3 per cent. Most of that increase has occurred in the past 10 years. In the past 10 years our net foreign debt has gone from $6.8 billion to $131 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Virtually all of that has occurred since the Hawke Government came to office and the long term consequences for this nation are very grave indeed. I cannot quote a much better authority on what this Government has done to our economy than the man who until March-April of last year was the Minister for Finance for the Hawke Government and had been for the preceding four or five years. In a speech in New York only 10 days ago he said that the Government had `massively stuffed up the economy'. And he explained why.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This also had the perverse effect of pushing up an exchange rate already too high. The credit squeeze was a policy response to the blow-out in aggregate demand which, in 1988-89, pushed the current account deficit above 6 per cent of GDP, at a time when our terms of trade were on a 12 year high. The credit squeeze-
       </para>
       <para>
        said Senator Walsh, very correctly-
       </para>
       <para>
        was a policy of last resort because other options for curbing demand were, or were perceived to be, closed off. Thus, it can be argued that the present recession is a function of fiscal policy being too loose.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look at what the Treasurer has been saying about fiscal policy over recent months, we will get a very different position. In his Budget Speech just seven months ago he said that the forecast at that time of $8.1 billion `maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon against the current account deficit and our overseas debt'. Then on 22 February, just 10 days ago, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The estimated surplus is now much lower-$1.7 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only three days ago, on 3 March, on the Sunday program on Channel 9, when asked whether the Budget would go into deficit, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It's always a possibility . . . It would be no calamity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has a fundamental question to answer. Senator Button was unable to answer it today. It is a fundamental question that goes to the heart of economy policy that the Treasurer must answer, that is: if a Budget surplus of the order of $8.1 billion only seven months ago was seen as the Government's principal weapon against the current account deficit and our overseas debt and if now, as he says, it would be no calamity not only if that were all wiped out but also if indeed the Budget goes into deficit, what is the explanation for the total contradiction between those two terms? Senator Button today tried to tell us that the reason for the difference was that the world had changed and we have really plunged into recession since the Treasurer introduced his Budget just seven months ago on 21 August.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Treasurer, only three months after that, told us that he had planned the recession, that it had been deliberately-to use his word-`engineered', and that he had pulled the levers to engineer that recession. Did he not know on 21 August that he was going to start pulling a few levers? If he did not know on 21 August that he was going to pull a few levers, why did he not? If the Treasurer cannot provide answers to that fundamental question, and if the Treasurer cannot now come up with an unequivocal statement on the role that the Government sees for fiscal policy and the policy weapons that the Government is now going to use to tackle the problems which, it said, fiscal policy was the principal weapon for, then the Treasurer should resign; and if he does not resign, he should be sacked.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition, by contrast, is very clear on the role that it sees for fiscal policy: despite the recession, fiscal policy should remain tight. If there is a continuation of the fiscal laxity that is now prevalent throughout every area of government, with the wipe-out of the Budget surplus, the Budget probably going into deficit, and a borrowing requirement this financial year, 1990-91, of close to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, and then it is compounded-and let us see what happens in that respect next week with the much-vaunted industry statement, which is going to be a ripper-and if that finishes up further weakening fiscal policy, then this Government will stand condemned even more than it stands condemned today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further pressure will be put on interest rates-that is the only thing that can happen. The reason for that is that this Government has failed to tackle the fundamental problems of structural reform in this economy and society which need to be addressed in order for us to increase our productivity and, therefore, our output. All that will happen as demand increases because of, amongst other things, increased fiscal laxity, is that very quickly demand will bounce up again against the supply ceiling in this country and will spill over into imports. We will be back on the old accentuated treadmill of balance of payments crisis, inflation crisis and boom and bust, which have been the hallmarks of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not good enough for the Treasurer to cloud the issue of the Budget position by talking about structural and cyclical surpluses or deficits. As I said, regardless of the reason, the public sector will be making calls on financial markets this year and that, categorically and unequivocally, is bad. By condoning the magnitude of the fiscal deterioration, the Government has signalled that it will be leaving monetary policy once again to bear a quite unequal share of the burden of adjustment. Ask any businessman, family or householder in this country what that cripplingly high interest rate policy, that deliberate interest rate policy-because the Government has not had the guts or the ability to take the other measures necessary to get a proper mix of policies in this country-has done to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government is unable or unwilling to address the structural rigidities in the economy. I have to say that one of the prime architects of this policy-namely, Senator Cook-is sitting opposite and will follow me in this debate. As the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook is presiding over the continuing rigidities and inflexibilities in the labour market. This critical area of the economy and structure of this country needs a fundamental loosening up and deregulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government did the right thing back in 1983-84 when it deregulated the financial markets. However, in doing so it made a fundamental error-it did not deregulate the other arm of labour market policy. As a result, we have had a Government which, ever since it has been in office, has relied on the accord to try to keep the lid on wage increases. One would have to say that to some extent that has not been a total failure. But what has been a total failure is that in doing so, the Government has put a high inflationary floor under the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the Government continues to have a policy which relies on the accord, it will continue to institutionalise high inflation in this country and we will never be allowed to get out of the desperate straitjacket that we are in-the desperateness shown in the economic statistics that are published every day. I must say that I do not hold out much hope of any change in this area. Senator Cook said the other day that the $12 a week wage increase-a wage increase not at all based on productivity-would not cost Australians one job. I ask Senator Cook to ask any employer what it is going to cost in terms of employment. It may not mean that people will be put right off the payroll. What is happening now is that the work force is rocketing to a four-day working week, which means a 20 per cent cut in workers' wages. That situation will continue, and may get worse, as a result of the $12 a week increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no magic pudding solution to the problems. Everyone accepts that there is a very long, hard road ahead of this country to get out of the mire of fundamental economic problems. I remind the Senate that it is a mire that is largely of the Government's own doing because of the policies that it has pursued. There is a better way, an alternative way. The coalition has spelt it out consistently for several years now in terms of the use of fiscal policy; the proper balance between fiscal and monetary policy; the use of wages policy; the freeing up of the labour market; and not relying on rhetoric but having the practical specific proposals to tackle the fundamental areas of micro-economic reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should never have had the recession that we are now experiencing. It is due to policy miscalculations and mismanagement. Given that we do have it, let us take the opportunity to get at some of the structural problems and other problems confronting us which regrettably, disgracefully, this Government is refusing to tackle at all.

In fact, the image of catastrophe and impending doom that has been projected is no doubt what an Opposition would be expected to wish to paint. To talk down the economy is what an Opposition would be expected to do but, nonetheless, one has to have a clear-eyed view of the facts and we have not been treated to one now.

        A remark was made-gratuitously, I thought-about the absence of Senator Button in this debate. It just so happens that Senator Button is working with the other senior economic Ministers in this Government to finalise the industry statement which will be made next Tuesday. Therefore, it is true that the Opposition has to put up with me. I would be delighted if I were somewhere else and not having to answer this but, now that I am here, I am delighted to have the opportunity to shed some light on these allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first thing that has to be said about what has been put is that there is, on an Opposition, an incumbent responsibility not only to criticise government-and we welcome that criticism-but to say what its alternative model is. We have not heard any exposition of an alternative today. We have heard an attack. We have heard references to, `Oh, we have always referred to our alternative model. Our alternative model is well known'. But really it is not. It has never been cogently presented. It is evasive, it is rubbery, and it is shadowy. It is designed to be all of those things so that there can be no public scrutiny of the alternative economic approach of the Opposition save in some areas of great passion and emotion for it-one would say prejudice and bigotry-that is, areas related to the labour market, which I will go to momentarily. But we do not have the alternative model. We have an allegation of fiscal laxity, and it is one that ignores the fact that, in all of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, Australia is closest to Japan in the size of the public sector. We have a very small public sector in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        It ignores the fact, too, that the woes of the current account figures -and there are some-are a reflection of borrowings of the private sector, not of the public sector. Overseas borrowings have raised our debt levels but they have not been, by and large, borrowings of the public sector. But I return to the theme, for the moment, of fiscal laxity. Here is an interesting theme- this is an opportunity for the Opposition. I invite it to fill the void, enter the vacuum. (Quorum formed)
       </para>
       <para>
        I had embarked upon the theme of the allegation of fiscal laxity by this Government-a theme that Senator Short propagated as the central plank in his argument. I now invite, as I did before I was rudely interrupted by the quorum call, other speakers from the Opposition to tell this Parliament and the people of Australia where it is they propose to be fiscally tougher. For example, is the Opposition going to deny the woolgrowers of Australia the money which this Government injected into that industry to support them in the deregulation period of the floor price? Are we going to deny them that? Is that an example of fiscal laxity to which honourable senators opposite refer?
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interests of fiscal toughness-which apparently is the obverse and what the Opposition would do-are we going to cut pensions in this country? Are we going to cut health benefits in this country, or are we, in the aftermath of the Gulf conflict, to cut some expenditure on defence? Are we going to do something about education? Those are all the big outlay areas of the Budget. If the Opposition is going to be fiscally tough and have a policy that might impress people, it should tell them the truth. What is the Opposition going to cut? The Opposition should stop hiding behind phrases and glib assertions and give us its alternatives. Until the Opposition does that, it is without clothes in this debate and its allegation about fiscal laxity does not stand.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of the importance the Opposition attaches to this debate, having made an issue about Senator Button's absence from the chamber, I should point out that we have just come through Question Time and on this subject there was but one question-an indication of the level of priority the Opposition assigns to it. There were four questions concerning Mr Burke and one question on the economy. This was an orchestrated Question Time by the Opposition. Let us put aside this rubbish about the Opposition believing that this is important.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the current account figures which, as I indicated, were released on 6 March, and deal with some key aspects of those figures. In seasonally adjusted terms, the current account deficit for January 1991 was $1.58 billion; in unadjusted terms it was $1.86 billion. The seasonally adjusted figure of $1.5 billion is a 10 per cent fall on the December figure-that is, the January figure is 10 per cent lower than the figure for December. I think it is important to identify the trend line. In seasonally adjusted terms, for the seven months to the end of January 1991, the current account deficit was 23 per cent lower than for the same period last year; again, the core trend is edifying when it is identified.
       </para>
       <para>
        In seasonally adjusted terms for the seven months to the end of January 1991 exports have risen by 8 per cent and imports have fallen by 5 per cent, indicating an ability to replace imports and lift our export volumes. Importantly, in that export figure there are two key aspects to which we should pay attention. Manufactured exports, the highest value-added exports, have continued their growth and were 16 per cent up on the previous figures. That has to be seen as a significant qualitative change. It also means that the Budget forecast last August for the current account deficit of $8 billion for 1990-91 is achievable. They are significant elements which, interestingly, have not been referred to in this debate by the Opposition because they go against the phantom argument which it proposes to put. Also, these export figures have been achieved in a very difficult climate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should like for a moment to talk about the falls in commodity prices. The result in the current account has been achieved despite prices for several of Australia's major commodity exports falling sharply in world markets since mid-1991. It could fairly be said that at Budget time last year one could not have predicted the fall in these prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me turn to the forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics of a decline in wool exports by about $1 billion in 1990-91. In fact, wool exports have fallen further than that. They have fallen from $5.9 billion in 1988-89 to $3.8 billion in 1989-90 and are projected to fall to $2.7 billion in 1990-91. In addition, exports of cereals were $3.1 billion in 1989-90 and are forecast to be $2.3 billion in 1990-91. Despite those falls in high volume, high money earning commodities in this current account figure, exports have increased by 8 per cent and manufacturing exports have increased by 16 per cent. With those trade terms running against us, there has nonetheless been that improvement in the current account. It does not indicate the catastrophe that has been foreshadowed here.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button in answer to a question at Question Time did say that a big difference now is that we are in a recession, and that is reflected to some extent, but, comparing this downturn with the 1982-83 downturn, there are important differences. Inflation is now beginning to come under control. The underlying rate of inflation continued to fall over this year to the December quarter of 1990 to 5.4 per cent. The Government is confident that this downward trend will continue, and our confidence is well-based.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the area of my own portfolio responsibility, the wage-tax trade-off delivered by the Government on 1 January was a significant circuit-breaker in the inflationary cycle. I interpolate that, if there is to be another significant circuit-breaker in the wages spiral in the next few years, it can be achieved only through an accord arrangement that we have with the Australian trade union movement, the like of which the Opposition envies but does not aspire to and cannot ever emulate in terms of its policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The orderly management of aggregate wage growth which the accord and the centralised wage system have given this Government have enabled it to deliver a predictable target figure, and in some cases to undershoot it, on what aggregate wage outcomes will be. We have a wages policy through the accord which enables that predictability and that degree of economic planning which the Opposition does not have. The fundamental labour market reform strategy in this Government under the processes of award restructuring has used the wages system to deliver improvements in the flexibility and productivity of Australian enterprises. That is another reason why there has been the increase in exports, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The attempt of the Opposition to blame wage and salary earners for all the economy's ills is implicit in what the Opposition says and it is central to what John Howard says. He calls for a return to a 40-hour week and the abolition of a leave loading. These are dangerous distractions from the necessity of continuing with the award restructuring task that we have embarked on. The success of award restructuring will make a vital contribution to turning around the current account deficit by making sure Australian enterprises can compete with their overseas counterparts.
       </para>
       <para>
        I move to a more fundamental point. Another fundamental difference in the economic performance of this country is that aggregate company profits have begun to decline substantially.

         —Today Senator Short has introduced a matter of public importance which once again chastises the Government for its failure to pursue policies to address Australia's fundamental economic problems, including its chronic balance of payments and debt problems, as demonstrated by the failure of the January balance of payments figures released today to show any significant improvement.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One could of course be a bit pedantic and say that the Government has pursued some policies to try to redress the difficult economic situation that we are in. It has certainly tried to do so. In its collective mind it probably thinks that it has produced the right policies. Unfortunately, the evidence is on the table that those policies were definitely the wrong policies. The central policy platform of the Government was to depress demand right across the economy by the use of high interest rates. It pursued that policy in an attempt to reduce Australia's demand for imports. Clearly this was the use of an indiscriminate sledge-hammer to crack one specific nut for which a nutcracker should have been used. We should have used specific measures to reduce our imports and boost our exports. Instead, we now have an engineered recession on our hands.
       </para>
       <para>
        The results of that recession have often been tabled, but they bear repeating. We now have an unemployment figure which is a quarter of a million people higher than it was a year ago. It is above 8 per cent and rising. Perhaps the worst statistic: it is 23 per cent of young people. These are people who are starting out in their lives; people trying to build careers; people who are the future of Australia. Almost a quarter of them are now without jobs. Clearly the Government has not succeeded in its policy to redress the economic problems. But neither, it must be said, has the Opposition offered any solutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have again listened carefully to what Senator Short had to say. Apart from micro-economic reform, which is certainly a laudable objective and one that must be pursued with vigour, I failed to detect in his speech any alternative program to develop our economy to the point where we can say that people once again can have jobs and where we are once again in a position to be internationally competitive. As it is, the foreign debt continues to rise, and the net income deficit as a result is also rising. In fact, today's January balance of payments figures confirm this alarming trend. The seasonally adjusted figure for the January current account deficit is nearly $1.6 billion, but the net income deficit for January is actually in excess of the total of $1.624 billion. We are now in hock to the world and the interest debt is driving us further into hock.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is saying that we have made great gains in terms of the merchandise trade component, and that is true. Over the past seven months the merchandise trade deficit has been reduced by $3.7 billion but, unfortunately, this has only been achieved by driving the country into recession, as I have said before. What will happen when the economy starts to recover? Imports will again start to blow out and all the pain of the recession will be for no gain on the current account. Clearly, we need to pursue some more effective import limitation policies. This will not be simple, given our intention to adhere to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, it has been shown that other nations do not have the same compunction about adhering to the guidelines. When we look at the subsidies that are being paid to primary producers in Europe and the United States, we wonder why we should move into a free trade position and deliver up our primary producers as the sacrificial lambs.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should look for very specific measures to reduce our imports. As an example, a plan, which should be given consideration, has been put forward by Mr Ernst Roedek from the Institute of Management and the Society for Balanced Trade. It seeks to relate directly our imports to exports by issuing credits for any exports that are actually affected and allowing them to be traded in the market as entitlements to introduce imports into Australia. No public money is necessary under that scheme, and exporters would receive significant benefits; in other words, it is a scheme where imports would subsidise exports. The matter has some complexity and would involve difficult transitional provisions. However, I believe that it is worth investigation by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also welcome the recent announcement by Senator Button of the first grants under the international trade enhancement program. Although only two firms have received assistance, it is certainly a welcome development. High technology manufacturing must be fostered in Australia if we are to become a modern and competitive industrial nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia also has a head start in various areas of environmental technology. We must not lose the commercialisation race of our inventions after doing so well in the research area. I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Stocker of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, who stresses the urgency of positive government action to get the potentially massive environmental industries off the ground in Australia. Alternative energy, waste management and pollution abatement are at a critical stage in Australia and a kick-start is needed now. All that is needed is the willingness to develop strategies which assist particularly strategically placed industries rather than offering up our economy on the altar of free trade and a totally deregulated market system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Crean and Mr Dawkins are correct when they cite the policy of the Australian Democrats, as they have in the last few weeks and months. We need more government intervention and more research. The cooperative research centres are something the Democrats support wholeheartedly, yet they still remain an idea. We would like some action and we would like it soon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's anti-dumping rules are obsolete. It is clear that we can no longer afford a system where damage has to be caused to Australian producers before action can be taken. Currently, the relevant legislation provides for 175 days for the process to take place to assess an anti-dumping claim. It is clear that that must be brought closer to 50 days. It is also clear to us that if a prima facie case is established we should place the onus for the final proof that they are not dumping on the people who are putting their products onto Australian markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many examples, such as the orange concentrate, cement, dried fruit from Turkey, canned ham, chemicals and pasta, to name just a few, have caused tremendous damage to our industries and lost jobs in Australia. It should not be beyond our wit to protect ourselves in this sort of situation. In extreme cases, I would suggest that we should even look at prohibiting the importation of specific items.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, another major area in this dumping procedure debate is currently taking place to which we should pay some attention; that is, the protection of our living standards, the protection of our social standards. Are we really saying that we are prepared to lose out to products which are produced by sweated labour under conditions which do not take any account of safety or the social and environmental values of our community. I believe that there is a strong case to tie the considerations of equal standards of production and social standards that apply in any one community to the question of how high protective tariffs should be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other areas require urgent attention. The tax system needs further tightening and orienting towards productive enterprises. I am pleased to hear, if the media are to be believed, that the Government has virtually determined that accelerated depreciation allowances will be part of the measures to be announced in the industry statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tariff reductions in isolation are not enough. We must guarantee that employees who are made redundant by the trade flows or by advancing technology are retrained at a level where they can still continue to maintain their families. As an example, a German worker may retrain four or five times in a career. We still have the mentality that people are useless if they become unemployed. As I have said before, we have proved that right now with a quarter of a million new unemployed people. This must be reversed. I am looking forward to the industry statement addressing this particular problem in a substantial manner.
       </para>
       <para>
        The developing country tariff preferences of five per cent, which is currently still enjoyed by Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, clearly need to be removed. These nations have stronger manufacturing bases than Australia and should not be granted an advantage which is so clearly out of date. I wonder why we are hesitating.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government purchasing is another key area where much more intervention is necessary. It has been shown in recent days by reports in the media that, in the defence area and overseas in the area of telecommunications, where orders are placed within a country and where industries are supported to gear up their production in a more productive manner significant gains can be achieved in terms of employment with virtually no losses in terms of the higher cost of products.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that we need national industry plans not only in steel, textiles and cars, where we have them now, but also in the forestry industries and tourism. We clearly need financial reregulation to protect investors and to give them courage and confidence to invest in Australia rather than taking the money overseas. We obviously need further amendments to the corporations legislation to ensure that companies and their employees are acting in the interests of Australian investors and are not simply lining their pockets. We need a serious effort on recycling and waste reduction as part of the drive to make us more competitive in the international area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final and possibly most important measure is the need to provide adequate capital for our small and medium sized businesses. These are the real entrepreneurs, not the paper shufflers who have disgraced Australia during recent times. I hope the encouraging newspaper reports concerning action by Senator Button are correct and that there will be a fund providing equity capital for small and medium sized businesses which are currently starved of capital as a result of the deregulation period and the banking boom and bust so evidently supported by the Government and the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that the Opposition does not have the answers. It continues with its position that everything can be solved by delivering our primary producers, our industry and our workers to the workings of the market rather than establishing priorities based on the aspirations of our community, which should result in carefully targeted intervention.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Opposition's policies, all goods and services would be taxed. Funerals, food and health services would all become more expensive, and luxury motor vehicles would become cheaper. Export assistance would be eliminated under the current Opposition policy, and there would be no guarantee or other assistance for primary producers. Capital gains will become tax free if the asset is held for more than five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear, when one looks at these components of the Opposition's policies that have been put forward, that it does not have the solution to our current economic problems. I think it is useful for the Opposition to submit such a matter of public importance, where the Government can be chastised for the direction it has taken which is costing Australian families dearly; unfortunately, it also discloses the Opposition's own bankruptcy as far as ideas and alternative directions are concerned.

        The current account figures released today are very high-much higher than expected initially. The figure is around $2 billion-$1.6 billion seasonally adjusted, and about $1.9 billion seasonally unadjusted. As I said, the figures are much higher than expected and imports are still disturbingly high. These figures will not do very much-in fact, they will do nothing-to trigger the turnaround of the Australian economy and the expected further drop in interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have run the course with using interest rates as an effective measure to control the economy. In fact, the Government has gone overboard with keeping interest rates high. Then, of course, we had the engineered recession. At least, the Government said it was engineered to try to recover some lost face when it ran straight into the worst depression since the 1930s.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that the Government's interest rate policy was wrong. In fact, I remember being on the same plane as the former Minister for Finance when we were going to a rural crisis meeting in Western Australia. When I asked him, `What have you got next?', he replied, `What can we find next? We used the high interest rate policy and it didn't work, so what else can we find?'. There was a full admission of what had gone wrong.

        In our present position there is no way that we can sustain the standard of living that we have been used to in Australia and the benefits that Australia needs so badly. The blow-out in the January current account deficit has seen money market yields rise and the hope of any further cut in interest rates has gone down the drain.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Acting Deputy President, as you would probably expect, I now turn to the effect of the decline in rural exports on the current account deficit. In the period from 1983-84 to 1987-88, rural exports increased by 14.1 per cent annually. If this growth were applied to the value of our rural products in 1987-88 of $15.242 billion, the estimated value of rural imports in 1989-90 would have been $19.850 billion. The actual figure was $15.305 billion. Thus, if rural exports had increased at the same rate over the last two years as in the previous four years, their value would have been $4.5 billion higher and the current account deficit reduced by the same amount. The policies of this Government have done anything but allow that to happen. A reduction of $4.5 billion in the current account deficit for 1989-90 would have represented a reduction of 22 per cent. That is only the rural sector, without considering what any other sector in the community could have done to improve the situation-and I have not mentioned mining.
       </para>
       <para>
        One economist has been quoted as calling the results announced today `a bit of a nightmare'. I know that there are many in rural Australia who would call the state of our economy far more than a nightmare. Actually, they do not have nightmares because, if people cannot sleep at night, they cannot have a nightmare. For many people, the nightmare is real. I know that because I go out there and see it all the time. I would be happy for some Government members to see it for themselves. In fact, Senator Aulich will probably be in my area next week with a standing committee. I invite him to take some time off so that I can take him around and introduce him to people who will back up exactly what I have said.
       </para>
       <para>
        The monthly deficit of $1.863 billion is about $300m above the highest market forecast, and compares with a $1.197 billion deficit in December. These figures show that imports are not falling in line with the weakness in the domestic economy, and also point to a crack in Australia's strong export performance in 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the tonnage of wheat exported increased over this current account period, the gross value decreased due to a reduction in the average price per tonne. I suppose someone will ask me whether I am blaming the Government for the drop in the return on wheat in the last 12 months. Well, yes, I am. Part of the blame lies with the Government but most of it lies with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This Government could have used more force with the GATT Round and the United States of America. Instead of sending this not-sohigh level delegation to the United States, it could have sent a top level delegation to work on the United States. Instead of sending a not-so-high delegation, it could have dealt with the European Economic Community as well and made sure that we maintain our share of the market in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was also the fiasco of Mr Kerin's change to the wheat marketing plan for the period from 1984 to 1989 when he took away the guaranteed minimum price (GMP). Unfortunately, the industry itself and industry leaders willingly gave away the GMP and now they want it back. They have not got a snowball's chance in hell of getting it back from this Minister. There was a decline in wheat income as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        The value of sheep and lamb slaughtering decreased for the second successive year by 25.8 per cent to $548.1m. The value of wool decreased for the first time since 1982-83 to $5.742 billion, a decrease of 2.8 per cent from 1988-89, but of course there has been a sudden downturn in the last few months. With the difficulties that we are now experiencing with our export of these commodities, one can only guess at how devastating these figures will be at the next round in a month's time.

        I move quickly to the people that this crisis is affecting most in the rural parts of Australia-that is, women. Friday, 8 March has been declared International Women's Day. For rural women, the past 12 months have been bleak due to the Government's mismanagement of the economy and next year they will be far worse off. The crisis is biting very hard in rural Australia, and the resulting depression in remote areas has compounded mostly on women. In 1986, the rural women's contribution amounted to $8 billion. In 1989, there were 390,000 people in the Australian rural work force of whom 100,000, or 26 per cent, were women.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the 2 1/2 million women living in rural Australia the current economic situation is catastrophic. Inflation, unemployment and high interest rates have hit hard. Pain and anguish stalk our farms and country towns. Three or four years ago high interest rates forced women into the work force in the small towns near their farms. They did that to increase their cash flow to help pay loans with interest rates that were out of this world. The recession has come along in the last 12 months and these women have now lost their jobs or have had to leave their jobs to help their husbands run the farm. The farmers could not afford to keep their sons on the farms any longer and their sons had to go to other projects such as mining or, if they were qualified, they went back into their professions so as to keep things moving.
       </para>
       <para>
        One-third of small businesses in Australia are owned by women. There has been further pressure on these women. Many of the small businesses are in the country. In his speech Senator Spindler pointed out that the bigger employers of personnel are small businesses rather than the large corporations. But it is the small businesses rather than the big ones that have been going broke in droves over the last 18 months. I know that the big businesses have had some downfalls, but certainly the small businesses have copped a lot. As I have said, one-third of those small businesses are owned by women. The downturn in small businesses was caused by farmers and other businesses ceasing to buy if not 12 months ago, then six months ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rural women have not had an equal opportunity in education because of this Government's mismanagement of the economy and because of its policies that favour places other than remote areas. That applies not only to the women but also to the young people. In 1987-88, 72 per cent of rural families monitored in an Isolated Children's Parents Association survey had a taxable income of less than $30,000 and 65 per cent of these families faced education and access costs between $5,000 and $15,000 in 1989. In 1973 an isolated child's allowance was half the boarding school fees. Nobody can tell me that that is a snob's education. Whether they like it or not, people living in remote areas can do nothing but use boarding schools. Now the Government's assistance for isolated children will be worth only 20 per cent of the boarding component. I hope that Government members who have any say in this area will have this assistance increased after the inquiry into this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Difficulties are also being experienced in retaining Austudy for tertiary age children. Last week a distraught mother rang me in my office. Her son was refused Austudy. On inquiry it was found out that Austudy had been rejected twice for a technical reason. On the third application it was granted so her son will now be able to continue his education.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government's management has done nothing for remote areas. Production in the rural areas is how we will get out of trouble in this recession. We have to get agricultural production up again so there is money in those areas. In the meantime, the mining industry is keeping us going. If on 12 March the Government makes the right decision and announces that it will introduce measures such as accelerated depreciation, many more projects will get going and improve the economy. Incentives must be provided to put these projects into place. As I mentioned earlier this morning, a compact steel mill in the south-west would provide employment. We have to get this country moving again. Unfortunately, the way that this Government is managing the economy is not doing anything to get it going again.
       </para>
       <para>
        Micro-economic reform is needed. We need costs cut on the waterfront so as to compete with our trading partners. That also has to be done in transport, and there has to be labour market reform. I do not have time to repeat it but this morning I gave a good example of a young fellow in Perth who had a job and earned $322 a week. The job was wiped out because of ridiculous labour market regulations. When we are in government we will certainly do something about that.
       </para>
       <para>
        My time is running out but I support everything that my colleague Senator Short said in this debate. No doubt, I will support what Senator Bishop says. This Government has badly mismanaged the economy. It has pushed us into a corner that I cannot see us getting out of for another four or five years unless it does a great turnaround now.

         —This debate is an important one but unfortunately it has tended to take the same direction as a number of debates on economics, both within this Parliament and outside the Parliament. On the whole it has been characterised once again by an obsession with finding a single cause and a single solution for Australia's economic condition. That in itself has proved to be, in a sense, a changing fashion ever since I came to this Parliament in 1984.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I recall the first major obsession that both the press and the Opposition, in particular, concentrated on when I first came here. It was the value of the Australian dollar. Fashions then changed. It became a question of Government spending. The next obsession was the deficit and surplus. All the questions that came from the other side were about that. In many cases, they were reported avidly by the economic gurus of the day. Now, of course, it is the balance of trade. All three have had their time as the most fashionable matter of public discussion and, in many ways, the most fashionable problem to be overcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one looks at the Government's record one sees that it has taken a fairly conservative approach to economic management. We have taken on board a large measure of the prescriptions brought forward and enunciated by the classical economists over the last decade. In fact, some of them might even be considered to be a new part of the Labor pantheon, because they have not been part of the traditional Labor approach to the way we managed economies in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will go through some of those prescriptions laid down by the economic gurus in the past and, in many cases, repeated by the Opposition. I could start with the deregulation of the financial system. This Government took the bull by the horns. It took the advice given by the prevailing orthodoxy at the time. We deregulated the banks. We allowed new players into the game. We floated the Australian dollar so that it would find its own place in the market; in other words, its real value was assessed. Obviously, at the end of the day, it was worked out by the market itself rather than by the more artificial and arbitrary methods used in previous years. The net result of that has been problems with the banks, a massive orgy of overlending and overcommitment, in some cases to very dubious enterprises in this country and, in some ways, the skew-whiffing of investment in this country towards speculative investment instead of long term investment in our blue chip industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The floating of the Australian dollar in the long run has made it at this stage about the fourth most traded currency in the world. No-one in this Parliament could say, for example, that the Australian dollar is genuinely at the correct level. I do not think that the market has set the Australian dollar at the level at which it should be as a measurement of the Australian economy. Its overly high value has certainly been a problem for exporters in this country.

         —It is not just because of our high interest rate policy; a number of other factors come into it. It might have something to do with Australia's vulnerability as a small country in a major world operation in which financial markets work more closely together every day.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second move that we made, apart from deregulating the financial system, was to cut government spending in gross terms and as a percentage of our gross national product. All the economic gurus called for that. It was the type of thing that everyone regarded as the most commonsense thing to do, and we did it. In 1984-87, government expenditure of gross national product was 37 per cent. By 1985-90 that had dropped to 31 per cent. In other words, a 6 per cent drop in the percentage of gross national product was taken up by government expenditure. During that period the only countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which surpassed us in terms of an effective record in that area were the United Kingdom and Ireland.
       </para>
       <para>
        As everyone knows, this Government has an unsurpassed record in its capacity to retire debt as debt becomes due and debts are rolled over. In effect, this Government has not borrowed for over four years because of its very tight budgeting policy. On the second point, we have basically carried out what the economic gurus over the past decade have been telling us to do. Again, the Opposition has supported us in that particular move. We have been able to do what the Opposition was never able to do in its period in government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third thing that we have done that fits in with the economic prescriptions of the classical economists is to drop tariff barriers and remove inhibition to freer trade. In fact, one could describe Australia as one of the leaders in the world in terms of its response to the overall General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) philosophy. We have dropped quotas in the car industry, we have removed controls over the importation of fertiliser, and so on down the line. Of course, as everyone knows, we have also dropped tariff protection and other forms of protection for the car industry, the textile industry, the footwear industry, the clothing industry and other industries. There has not been a government in the past 20 years that has followed the free trade route as assiduously as we have. We may not have taken it as far as some people would have liked in theory to have gone but we have done it within the realms of what is politically realistic and what is acceptable to social change in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has been the response there? We have led the way in GATT in trying to create an international level playing field. Have other countries followed our role? The answer is that in many ways some of the major players in the game, such as Japan and the United States, have given in to their particular vested interest groups and have used all forms of control to ensure that we are not able to compete on equal terms with their home-grown industries. That has been our reward for moving in that particular direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, we have attempted to control the flood of imports through tighter monetary controls and other techniques. We have kept interest rates high, and, at a time when now the high interest rate brakes need to come off, we have found that the banks themselves have created a secondary monetary policy in which they have continued to prop up interest rates at a much higher level than that which is acceptable to the market, is necessary for the recovery of this country and is acceptable to the Government. In fact, the banks have a second credit squeeze on. Why? In many cases, it is simply to compensate for the bad lending policies that they have been engaged in over the past five years or so. At the end of the day, the consumer suffers for that. Again, the Government has carried out the classical prescriptions advocated by the classical economists who dominate the thinking of the economic community here and, in particular, the major thinkers on the front bench of the Liberal-National Party Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have followed the prescription of the classical economists in reducing personal income tax and company tax. The reduction of company tax has in no way diminished the move towards an increase in the number of incorporated bodies in Australia. Amongst the OECD countries, Australia has one of the highest levels of incorporation of companies. Why? No-one is quite sure but one would believe that to some extent it is related to limited liability that is given by the company structure. The lowering of personal income tax rates has not in any way halted that move towards the greater incorporation of entities in this country. Again, the reduction of personal income tax has in many ways not succeeded in the way that many people had hoped. Yet that was one of the major calls advocated by the Opposition. The Opposition has said, `Reduce personal income tax and you will increase incentives to work and this country will get going again'. Once again, the classical prescription has not worked in the way many people, in particular the Opposition, hoped it would.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one area where the Government differs very strongly from the Opposition. There have been continuing calls for deregulation of the labour market. Let us face it; when we get down to tintacks and as a Government go to the Opposition and put these prescriptions to it, saying, `Yes, we have carried out most of those. Now what do you want us to do?', the Opposition says, `You may have carried those out but it is essential that you move towards deregulation of the labour market. If only you could do that, coupled with micro-economic reform, and increases in productivity, Australia would get going again'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, in that search for single cause and single solution approaches to economics, the Opposition is wrong. If we look at the success of the accord we see a very good reason why this Government will refuse to deregulate the labour market in the way that the Opposition is calling for. Studies done by Mr Bruce Chapman and Fred Gruen in 1990 calculated the value of the accord in a number of ways. In economic terms, their calculations indicated, according to the models that would give a uniformity throughout the world to conditions relating, for example, to wages and economic growth and so on, that between 1983 and 1987 Australia would be in the position of having a 70 per cent fall in the level of industrial disputes compared with 40 per cent for the rest of the world. Similarly, their studies showed that the wage-caused part of inflation was dropping at about 3 per cent per annum between 1983 and 1989. Again, there was a reduction in real wages; that is, the cost to employers of employing people on the whole dropped between 9 per cent and 10 per cent over the period 1983 to 1989. Of course, this was compensated for in terms of the workers' benefits by improvements in social security and other areas such as health and a spread and a deepening of superannuation benefits which at last were given to a much larger section of the community compared with that which was enjoyed, say, 20 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        The worker got a better deal; the Government, in many ways, got a better deal; and the community got a better deal out of that improvement in superannuation benefits. This is remembering that in 1988-89 Australia experienced boom years in its growth. Yet that was not accompanied by wages explosions. It is interesting that we can have a boom and yet no wages explosion. That is primarily because the accord-that unique social document, an economic management tool drawn up and redrawn through consultation between the trade union movement and the Government-worked in a way that has been of great surprise to other countries in the OECD. Whenever I have been overseas and talked to people in this area who have an interest in industrial relations, economic development and the role of social contracts, they have gone out of their way to state that Australia has engaged in a unique and successful experiment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put on record here that this Government in no way is going to resile from the notion and the practice of a social contract along the lines of the accord. The accord is a flexible instrument for social, economic and labour policy. It is something that we are sticking with. All the calls by the Opposition along the lines of classical economics-all those calls for a change to the accord, for an ending of the accord, and for a deregulation of the labour market-will come to nothing, because the accord is still one of the major successes of this Government and of the management of this economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        What have members of the Opposition offered? To Australia's problems they are offering the simple solution of a consumption tax, increased micro-economic reform, and cutting government spending further. And that is it. How on earth can the people of Australia accept an alternative party which has only that trio of solutions to offer for the improvement of Australia's economic productivity and Australia's economy?

         —Sitting here listening to the debate put forward by the Government, one cannot help but feel sadness. Senator Short and others have drawn attention to the fact that we have not had Senator Button with us today. Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in this chamber, has not seen fit to be present when we are dealing with areas affecting the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), his own policy area of industry, and of course Senator Evans's area of trade. It is pleasing to see Minister Cook present for at least the part of this debate concerning the need for the deregulation of the labour market. He is relevant to that extent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, the absence of Senator Button, I think, has to be remarked upon, particularly as we are now hearing the universal excuse of the need to prepare the ubiquitous industry statement. The industry statement has been used recently by the Prime Minister to say that he could not accept Dr Hewson's suggestion to accompany him to the United States to lead a mission to attempt to prevent the United States dumping wheat on our traditional wheat markets in the Middle East: he had to stay here because he had to finalise the industry statement. We cannot have Senator Button in the chamber today because he has to be away finalising the industry statement. Yet we read in the newspaper yesterday that indeed the industry statement has already been finalised and that Cabinet put its marker on it yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we find ourselves in the situation of having a debate where the main theme has been: do not blame us; we have really done a good job and Australia is in great shape. Senator Cook's theme of near enough being good enough is one we have heard before. He says, `Do not criticise us; we are really doing a great job'. He says that the Opposition should really be blamed because its policies have not been spelt out enough and indeed implemented. Of course, the problem with that argument is that Dr Hewson has on many occasions said that, if the Government took over and adopted policies which we have put forward, it would get bipartisan support and Australia might have a chance to get out of the recession, which, the Treasurer has told us, he specifically engineered. He told us that we were having the recession we had to have, but subsequently he has gone on to admit that he got it wrong and the Prime Minister has gone on to admit that he got it wrong. I wonder how long we are going to have to wait before we see a resignation or two that says that they wish to atone for having got it wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        The argument that Senator Short put forward in opening this debate was simply to condemn the Government for its failure to pursue policies to address Aus- tralia's fundamental economic problems, including the chronic balance of payments and debt problems which have been highlighted today with the release of those figures showing that in seasonally adjusted terms we have gone down the tube a further $1.6 billion. Senator Cook would have us believe that it is really okay, that we are not going down the tube quite as quickly this year as we did last year and that really we should take some sort of solace from that fact.

        Senator Short outlined neatly and clearly that the Treasurer told us at the time of the introduction of the Budget that we were going to have this wonderful surplus of $8 billion, now disappearing fast down to $1.7 billion and about to disappear altogether. Three months later, having presented that Budget and having told us that everything was wonderful, he told us that he was pulling the levers that would trigger the recession we had to have. Senator Short asked: how can we believe a man who within a space of three months tells us that everything in the country is terrific and that we have to be plummeted into the dire straits of a recession? Tell that to the unemployed. Tell that to the people who are suffering personal bankruptcies. Tell that to ordinary Australians, for whom recession translates into pain and suffering. Tell it to kids who are being pulled out of school. Tell it to the kids whose excursions are not able to be afforded. Tell it to the women who have been earning that second income but have lost their jobs, not even being counted in the unemployment figures. Tell it to those who cannot make their mortgage payments because of the high interest policy that the Government has pursued, which has meant that people are starting to lose their homes. Feel proud of that, Senator Cook? It is not a good record to defend, is it? I truly do feel a touch of sorrow for the Minister.

         —Oh, Senator Cook! The deregulation of the labour market, which is relevant to the Minister's portfolio and which is essential if we are to see our way out of the mire, becomes pivotal in this debate today for the simple reason that it brings into sharp focus what occurred subsequent to the deregulation of the financial market. What did we have? We had a freeing up of the financial market and we had a tight grip held on the labour market which affected all those industries in manufactures where we needed to see positive investment and where we saw investment not flowing for the simple reason that the areas that were left were property and paper, where regulation and a tight grip of the labour market were not felt.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have promised that we will see a deregulation of the labour market; a reduction of tariffs to a negligible rate by the year 2000, concurrently with micro-economic reform in the areas of telecommunications, privatisation, transportation and the wharves; and, further, the reform of the tax system, including the abolition of the wholesale tax system and the introduction of a goods and services tax. These solutions are all relevant to making Australia competitive and, unless Australia is truly competitive, there is no way we can trade our way out of the dilemma and the difficulties which eight years of this Labor Government have delivered to the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently the Business Council of Australia published a worthwhile volume: Developing Australia's National Competitiveness. I think it is worth quoting:
       </para>
       <para>
        Being competitive in any market means firms satisfying customers in relation to price, quality and reliability and unless the nation can compete it soon loses the wherewithal to save and invest enough to stay in the race except by cutting living standards or increasing borrowing indefinitely. Neither is a viable long-term option. The challenge is to improve the performance of the whole Australian economy by tackling the underlying determinants of competitiveness.
       </para>
       <para>
        As long as we have Senator Cook and others-in particular, Senator Aulich-claiming that the accord is a great solution to Australia's problems, we will go on seeing Australia in an economic bind. The accord is no solution. The accord is part of the problem. Until we see deregulation of the labour market, we will not see our way clear.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us take a really good look at the part Senator Button has played in bringing Australia to its knees. I said at the beginning of my speech that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister played a major role, but so has the good Senator Button-who cannot be with us today. He has presided over eight years of failed industry policy. The balance of payments figures today simply bear that fact out. Also today we have seen the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) leading a low level bipartisan mission to the United States, a mission that will not go on to the European Community but will simply spend one day talking to the United States Administration and one day lobbying the Congress.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we see that mission go, we realise that we have a Prime Minister who has not been prepared to take up Dr Hewson's offer to go to the United States to fight for Australia's right to maintain those markets. The Prime Minister has not done so for two reasons. One is that the precious industry statement might have been read by the Treasurer; a bit of the gloss might have rubbed off on him. Second, I suggest that the Prime Minister really did not want his influence in the United States truly tested. He was not prepared to take the risk of being rebuffed. Because of his own vanity he was not prepared to go to the United States with Dr Hewson to attempt to fight for Australia's access to those markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, we also have that wonderful institution, Austrade. Austrade was relaunched by Senator Button who fought to keep it out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade because he wanted to be in command of it. He fought for it. In 1986 he relaunched it. He said that it would be the answer to all our trading problems. Well, four years later we have the damning McKinsey report which has simply said that Austrade has failed. If we want a bit of good evidence that it is still failing we need only look at Austrade's record in the last several days in dealing with getting Australian contractors into the market for the reconstruction of Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        To begin with, Austrade released a press statement on 28 February which said that it had been contacted by some 150 companies interested particularly in engineering, construction and equipment supply with regard to the reconstruction of Kuwait. It said that the first stage of the letting of contracts was expected to last some 120 days and that the second stage would last some five years. It was also stated that the potential for Australian companies in the second stage would include communications, processed food, defence support, security systems, health services and agriculture. It also said that it had registered some 30 Australian companies with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which is handling the first stage of the reconstruction.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, to test that statement, a would-be exporter phoned Austrade to find out how good its intentions and ability to deliver was. He was very simply told that it was unlikely that Australian companies would get any contracts in the first round; we had missed the boat, but hold on and hope for good luck in the second round. He was further informed that four Australian officials had been withdrawn from Riyadh at the outbreak of hostilities. I do not know what level those officials were; that was not part of the information given. However, there has been an announcement that we will now be putting back the No. 2 man. Hopefully that will improve our prospects of doing business. It will not.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the time when we need that solid representation; when we needed, in those four years under Senator Button's administration, Austrade to grow and strengthen and be ready for an opportunity such as this, his policies have failed us yet again. Government action has failed this country badly. All we have had is tight monetary policy which has led to unnaturally high exchange rates, despite a bit of intervention now and again, and crippling interest rates, which have stifled demand and strangled investment. The outcome has been bankruptcy, personal pain and suffering and job losses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today is a significant day. Today marks the start of the ninth year of Labor administration in this country. It is a good reason for wearing black. The Treasurer has failed, and has admitted he has failed. Industry policy has failed. We are yet to hear the apology from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. The Government has failed. Australia is in a recession it did not deserve. Australia is in a recession which has yet to feel the true impact of the rural recession and the overseas economic slowdown. In other words, it is going to be a double-whammy.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the beginning of the Government's ninth year I hardly think we can wish the Australian people happiness and prosperity. We can only say, `Australians hang on'. If the Government will have the good sense to accept our policies we will give it bipartisan support and give this nation and the Australian people a chance to fight back and show that, despite the poverty of the Government's policies, we can win in the end.

         —We are discussing a matter of public importance introduced by the Opposition, which states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The failure of the Government to pursue polices to redress Australia's fundamental economic problems, including its chronic balance of payments and debt problems, as demonstrated by the failure of the January balance of payments figures released today to show any significant improvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important to go through some of the facts in order to refute some of the things that Senator Short and other Opposition senators have said. In January the balance of payments battled an unfavourable movement in the terms of trade to record a 10 per cent improvement in the current account deficit over the month of December in seasonally adjusted terms. The seasonally adjusted January balance of payments figure is $1,582m, recording an improvement of $175m. Exports rose by 1.3 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms. Imports fell by $83m or 2 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the seven months to the end of January 1991, compared with the seven months to the end of January 1990, the deficit on current account was down $3,299m or 23 per cent. For the same period, exports rose $2,241m or 8 per cent; imports fell by $1,496m or 5 per cent. Endogenous imports fell $1,964m or 7 per cent. Manufactured exports continued their growth and were up 16 per cent for the same period. In answer to Senator Short, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) believes that the balance of payments figure again indicates that the current account deficit is on track for the Budget forecast of $18 billion. They are the facts.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have seen today is the Opposition facing its ninth year in Opposition and with no solutions to the problems that Australia faces. I am very pleased to see that 16 per cent increase in the seven months for manufactured exports. Of course, we are not satisfied with a situation in which 72 per cent of our imports are manufactured goods. Next week the Government will take further steps to build on the plans that it has implemented from the time it came to office in 1983 in the steel, metal and shipbuilding industries and a whole range of other industries. These are quite apart from the broad parameters it has laid down to try to transform industries, whether they are manufacturing or service industries, to make them more efficient and more capable of coping with the changing world that we face.
       </para>
       <para>
        Major restructuring of industry that this Government has implemented will, in a cooperative way, make sure that with the multi-skilling of our work force and the cooperation of everybody in Australia, we tackle the problems and get a result. Senator Short, who in his previous life worked as an adviser to the Fraser Government, would know the difficulties that the coalition Government had in finding the wherewithal to get cooperation in persuading people to change the way in which they had worked for many years.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government, in recent years, has seen a transformation of the work force. Through award restructuring, we have been able to enable people to do things that they would never have done before. This movement to get productivity increases by people working smarter and better is a characteristic of the way Australia will work itself out of the recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has not happened by accident. This Government's policy is to invest in our human capital. When we came to office we realised that too many young people were not continuing their education after year 12. We have taken the retention rate from 33 per cent to 66 per cent. Investment in education and training is a characteristic of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are pursuing these problems. I believe that we have policies in place that will enable us to build on eight years of changing the way people work. But it is a slow process. Today the Opposition has not advanced any strategy at all. It has adopted a spoiling approach to this issue and has not addressed many of the problems. It simply cannot stand the fact that the accord system has allowed for not only the reduction of inflation-in rebuttal of what Senator Short has said-but also for laying the basis of further activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reference is made in the matter of public importance to the balance of payments and debt problems. One would think from the way Opposition senators have spoken that this is completely the responsibility of the Government. But Brent Davis, chief economist with the Australian Chamber of Commerce, has pointed out that the current account deficit for January was the result of a soaring interest bill for foreign debt. At the end of December-and these are the most recent figures available-the net external debt was $130.8 billion. Of this, $82 billion, or 62 per cent, was private debt, with $48.8 billion being public debt. I think that needs to be said in view of the fact that a number of speakers have conveyed that this is completely a government problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition referred to micro-economic reform and deregulation of labour movement and if I have time I will come back to those subjects. But it has not told us what its real proposal is for the Australian people. Ordinary people should not be confused by the many figures that have been quoted. They should remember that the basic thrust of the Opposition is to introduce a consumption tax. That is the disaster that the Opposition is promoting-a consumption tax of 15 per cent or 18 per cent. This would mean that medical bills, hair cuts, margarine, luxury yachts and cars, rent, public transport, fares, fruit and vegetables could all be taxed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Effectively, one would have to pay to eat under a coalition government because so far the Opposition has not indicated that foodstuffs or anything else would be excluded. The Opposition is trying to confuse the issue. At the moment there is a tax levy of 30 per cent on jewellery, furs, cosmetics, gold watches, and things of that type, and 50 per cent on motor vehicles costing more than $48,000. But there is no tax on medical services, shoes, or all the other things that will be subject to the coalition's consumption tax if it were ever to gain the treasury bench. Of course, the secret is that everyone would pay a tax on the ordinary necessities of life but the friends of Dr Hewson and the Opposition would be able to purchase a car worth $97,000 for $77,000. In other words, people at the big end of town would be able to gain $20,000 on this sort of luxury item that seems to condition the thinking of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is only part of it. Dr Hewson, who is a bit inexperienced, is occasionally inclined, in a very Freudian way, to divulge what the game plan is about. He did so when he was asked about the reduction of company tax. In so many words, he let out the fact that, of course, company tax may be phased down. He said, `Whether we'll actually do it in our first term we will announce in due course'. That is very embarrassing for the Opposition because it indicates that ordinary people who pay the consumption tax will be subsidising reductions in company tax. The Opposition has a secret plan to try to make sure that ordinary people will help the coalition relieve the tax burden on people who are well off.

         —I quoted the fact that Dr Hewson has been embarrassed by his admission that this is the way the Opposition is thinking. Of course, he has haggled about the words. But I used the words `a Freudian slip'. Clearly he has haggled about the words. But the reality is that that is the game plan. It hurts the Opposition to be exposed in this way. We know that there is a nexus-a link-between the proposal that company tax be reduced and the intention that ordinary people will have to pay a tax of 15 per cent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Short had the audacity to make inflation the major point of his speech. Yet, a 15 per cent consumption tax could add 7 percentage points to the level of inflation. This would be a very serious situation as far as the Australian economy is concerned. So, the issue of a consumption tax has direct relevance to this debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it is even worse than that because the Liberal and National parties have very close links with the United Kingdom. Indeed, this idea of a consumption tax is in many ways based on the Thatcher model. Thatcher and that other `Major' problem in the United Kingdom were concerned with the introduction and the extension of a consumption tax in England. The important thing here is that the Conservative Government in the United Kingdom has a balance of payments deficit of significant proportions. Even with all the North Sea oil and a consumption tax, the Government of the United Kingdom continues to have a massive deficit. The situation is that in one country that is very close to us-the United Kingdom-the consumption tax has been a tremendous impost on ordinary people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to some of the things Senator Short said, which indicate the view of the Opposition. He said that there was the problem of the rigidity of the labour market. Senator Short wants the deregulation of the labour market, and he was supported in this by Senator Bishop. Senator Short then said that the accord had caused a high inflationary floor under the economy. If one adds to that the views of his colleague Mr Howard, who wants to abolish leave loading and wants people to work lengthy hours, one can see that between them members of the Opposition want to turn the clock back because there is no way one can have the cooperation of people if one poses something so unfair as the proposed deregulation of the labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        In brief, one can say that the Opposition is proposing that employers in every enterprise will have access to the lawyers and the economists and all those in the employer associations. The Opposition proposes to cut off ordinary people in an enterprise from their union. It is as simple as that; it is designed to give an uneconomic and unfair advantage to employers. In a recession the idea of doing that is to give capital an advantage over employees in such a situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        For that reason, it will not be accepted by ordinary people because they will see that it is unfair and will not give them the security and confidence this Government has through the accord to make sure that people share fairly burdens and advantages and, at the same time, have the training and the education to be able to work smarter and so improve the productivity of this country.

       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is, first, to extend the sultana underwriting scheme by three years and, second, to remove statutory backing for domestic consumer transfers on the sale of dried vine fruit through the removal of the domestic component of statutory equalization.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill forms part of the Government's response to the Industries Assistance Commission's report into the dried vine fruits industry. The other part is contained in the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sultana underwriting scheme was implemented in the early 1980s in response to low world prices of sultanas. This in turn was the result of an over-supply of sultanas on world markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        The scheme was triggered in its first year of operation and $1.3 million was paid out to producers. This amounted to about $16 per tonne. There have been no pay outs since that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1986 the basis of the scheme was changed to reduce the level at which the Government would underwrite returns. The level was set at 80 per cent of the average ``Free on Board'' export return for the past three years. As well, a sunset clause was included so that the scheme would terminate on 31 December 1990. This move reflected the Government's view that, where possible, industry should take increasing responsibility for risk management and for responding to the vagaries of the marketplace.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the context of the current changes to the level of government involvement in other areas of the dried vine fruits industry and the Government's concern to minimise the impact of these changes, the Government is prepared to extend the underwriting scheme for a period of three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        In doing so, the Government is also taking into account the very regionalised nature of the dried vine fruits industry and concentrated effect on the regions that any impact could have.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the second purpose of the Bill, that concerning equalization arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        In each year when domestic returns of dried vine fruit exceed export returns, and this has been the case in 26 of the past 30 years, the domestic consumer effectively subsidises dried vine fruit exports through the operation of the equalization arrangements. In the 1985 year, for example, the Industries Assistance Commission reported this transfer amounted to some $13 million.

        This is not the only effect of equalization. As well, it has the effect of masking market signals to producers. A higher than actual return paid to a producer can result in poor production decisions and the misallocation of valuable resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has acted in the past to reduce this masking effect by putting a cap on the equalization payment that could be made over and above the average export return. This was implemented through legislative amendment in 1986 and equalization payments are now limited to 15 per cent above average export returns.
       </para>

        Nonetheless, the Government remains of the view that domestic transfers should cease and this can be achieved by removal of the domestic component of the equalization arrangements.

        Equalization of export returns are set to continue and will take the form of a reconciliation of exporter returns after the end of each season. There will be no requirement for levy arrangements under equalization of export returns.

        —by leave-I wish to explain why the Opposition called two quorums on Senator Cook during his contribution to the debate on the matter of public importance today. Senator Cook was leading the debate for the Government on the matter of public importance. Calling quorums is not a tactic that the Opposition uses lightly, but it is one of the very few tactics available to an opposition to protest when the government of the day fails to treat the opposition and the parliament with the appropriate seriousness and respect which I believe they are both due.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Opposition called the two quorums today because the matter of public importance we had brought forward was a matter of considerable importance which goes to the whole heart of the problems confronting this nation at the moment. It followed the release earlier this morning of the balance of payments figures, which show a continuing disastrous situation for the external account and for the economy. Therefore, in our view, it was incumbent on the senior relevant Minister in the Senate to respond to the matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not the first time in the life of this Parliament that Senator Button, the Minister responsible, has failed in this respect. In fact, on every occasion that I can recall Senator Button has failed to participate in debates of this nature called by the Opposition on matters going to the very heart of the problems of this country. The Opposition believes that is treating the Parliament with contempt. We will continue to take that action until such time as the Government exercises the responsibility and propriety towards the Parliament and the Opposition that a matter of such considerable importance warrants.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wanted to explain why the Opposition took the action it did today. It is not something that the Opposition does lightly, but the approach of the Government and of senior Government Ministers towards the Senate on matters of debate as important as this issue is deplorable and that is not a situation that the Opposition will continue to tolerate.

The debate on the matter of public importance was led for the Government by a senior Cabinet Minister. Senator Short knows full well, as he has been here long enough, that there are matters involving important business for the Government. Indeed Cabinet is engaged in a very important debate today which requires the attendance of Ministers such as Senator Button from time to time. Of course the Government demonstrated the respect that it has for this chamber and for the parliamentary process by having a senior Cabinet Minister lead the debate for the Government on the matter of public importance. I think the interjection of `Humbug' summed up pretty well the proper response to Senator Short's assertion.

      </para>
      <para>
       In respect of the annual report for 1989-90, I wish to refer to that portion of the report at page 13 under the heading `Design Integrity' where the Chairman of the Parliament House Construction Authority comments that the Authority, through the architect:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . has provided the nation with the building called for in the User Requirement Statement approved by Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is worth reminding people of that fact. Criticisms are made of this building from time to time but, in my view, the architects have built the building that they were asked to build. The user requirement statement was settled long before I became a member of the Parliament; I think it was 1979 or there- abouts that that was the case. The report goes on to refer to the design competition and some of the criteria against which the winning design was judged.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report refers to the fact that use of the building will inevitably mean that some changes will be required; technology changes alone will determine that there will be modifications to the way in which the building operates. The Authority recognises, as it says in the report, that there will be a continuing need to modify and update facilities to see that the building functions into the future to meet the needs of those who use it. With this in mind, there was an agreement with the Executive Government to a proposal that came from the Authority to establish an advisory panel to monitor and advise on proposed changes to the building. We all recognise that there will be significant changes to the building as the years pass. I also feel quite strongly that the basic design integrity of the building should be maintained-perhaps not at all costs, but certainly to the greatest extent possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       There was a proposal that a significant group be established, of eight members, chaired by an eminent former member of the Parliament to advise on changes to the building. Without wishing to incur the wrath of the Senate, I refer to a matter that is on the Notice Paper-the notice of motion given by Senator Bolkus to establish the Parliament House Advisory Panel, which is referred to in this report. The Authority says that it considers the establishment of the advisory panel to be a vital step in ensuring that the integrity of the design is protected for future generations.
      </para>
      <para>
       My reason for raising this matter today is that there is a proposal before the Senate which would establish a panel consisting of eight members and this goes on in a number of paragraphs to indicate what they would do and how they would operate. My disappointment with the proposal before us and the reason that I personally would vigorously oppose it in its present form is that, of the eight members appointed, seven are to be appointed by the Government and one by the Opposition. I do not regard that as a bipartisan approach to something that is as important as maintaining the integrity of this building. I am opposed to the panel being established at all if that is the way in which it is to be done. It is a great pity indeed that the matter should be put in that fashion. I also feel that appointments from the Senate are not in adequate proportion. That perhaps is the lesser of the two criticisms that I would have about the panel itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       The President can appoint somebody to represent him and one other, the Speaker can appoint someone to represent him and one other, the relevant Minister can appoint a representative and one other, and the Leader of the Opposition can make an appointment to represent him. I concede that under item (E) the chairman, who is to be an eminent member or former member of either House, will be appointed by the President and Speaker after consultation with the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The consultation process is not entirely balanced, but even if one concedes that one, it is still six to be appointed by government and one by the Opposition. Now or into the future that is not the way it should be. This matter is before us. One of these days we shall be required to vote on it, and I thought it would save time if I now stated the position clearly.

       That the Senate take note of the document.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Chairman's summary at the beginning of the annual report of the Dried Fruits Research Council 1989-90, we are told that in 1990-91 the annual research and development program will total $1.1m. This money is raised by levies, which last year were $4.50 per tonne for dried fruit, $10.25 a tonne for dried tree fruit, and $11.00 a tonne for prunes. It is important to note from the report that new projects supported by the Council were in such areas as irrigation and water quality, trellis systems, dehydration technology and reduced reliance on chemicals and practical engineering developments for the dried tree fruit industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       These are all matters which make the Australian dried fruit industry superior to its international competitors. They are typical of the very matters which the Australian community as a whole expects, and rightly so, our primary industries to be concerned with. These are the very matters which add to our costs of production, but similar costs are not necessarily borne by our international competitors. When consumers in Australia ask, `Why is the produce of country X less expensive than our produce?', the answer is that our producers have accepted the responsibility of meeting the cost of research and improvement in production methods. Our society places other responsibilities on our primary producers. We expect our primary producers to pay Australian award wages and to pay all the add-on costs of employment, whether they be in the form of holiday pay, sick pay, payroll tax or the penalty rates that apply to shift workers. We also expect our primary producers to pay excises and tariffs on imported equipment, fuel and energy taxes, land taxes and income taxes. They support not only the primary producers themselves, but all members of our society for the benefit of our society.
      </para>
      <para>
       We all see the maintenance of those aspects of the Australian standard of living as fundamental and beyond compromise. Because the industry has accepted those responsibilities, we believe that the whole of society should similarly accept the responsibility of applying a penalty to imports that is equivalent to the total production costs which Australian producers bear. They bear this as part of the social costs. This should not be impos- sible to calculate and should not only provide benefits to Australian producers and consumers if it is applied, but also encourage foreign competitors to attempt to improve their growing practices, as we are told in the report that the dried fruit industry does. If by the application of such a penalty to imports we can encourage this, we will be improving research and employment practices throughout the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is important to consider all these things together because they are interconnected; they are not separate. It is not helpful, nor is it wise, to see the research funding aspect as separate-as being only the business of the dried fruit producers. Even when we look at a few of the areas that the Council considers as priorities, we see the opportunity for considerable community benefit. The report refers to some of the areas that are seen as priority areas for the Council in terms of research. We see that priority is given to improved farm weed control in pro- cessing technology to eliminate weed seed contaminations. Another priority is the development of production and processing systems to reduce reliance on the use of chemicals, particularly the fumigant methyl bromide. We see that another priority is the development of new fruit maturity standards. All these priorities have socially beneficial effects.

        —by leave-I thank the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who is at the table, for his tolerance. I also thank the Opposition for its tolerance. I rise to speak to the annual report of the Australian Sports Commission. As people know, I have a continuing interest in things to do with sport; in particular, the women in sport program. I would refer people with an interest in sport to this, I think, very useful annual report, going as it does to a number of areas of change in the sporting arena in this country.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I think that it provides us with ever-increasing, useful, constructive information and data in the appendices at the back. This data will be further developed over time, but we can look at those appendices for the allocation of funding to a very long list of sports. Where we have sports listed in terms of, for example, men's and women's lacrosse, we can see the allocation of those grants to both men and women in sport. I am particularly interested to notice hockey because some time ago I actually mentioned in the Senate that the number of men registered as hockey players was half the number of women registered as hockey players but the men's hockey allocation of sporting dollars was exactly double the women's hockey allocation. That is something that has been corrected with recognition and different allocation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am not one of those people who insist that the sporting dollar should be absolutely fixed in terms of numbers of registered players. There needs to be some flexibility in the allocation of sporting dollars to take account of, for example, olympic events or for a national or international event. This year if the men's lawn bowls was competing in an international championship, I think that all people involved in bowls would think that it was reasonable for them to get some extra assistance this year; likewise for the women in their lawn bowls championship. In the same year that I mentioned the hockey figures, the women's lawn bowls were in receipt of extra money precisely for that kind of factor. So there needs to be some flexibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       I cannot claim to have cracked the code on all of these headings, but from as much as I can read in these appendices the number of registered players seems no longer to be listed. I could be wrong. I would stand corrected on that. I cannot insist that that is not somewhere else in this document because I have not comprehensively read it. I also appreciate that there is some difficulty with the listing of registered players, because there is an agreement that the figures are somewhat unreliable. They depend on people from various organisations and from across the country putting in their lists of registered players. Who counts as a registered player may not be listed under the same criteria from every organisation or every sport. But I hope that the increasing database that is so constructive and so useful is something that we will see from the Sports Commission over time.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will briefly mention what is now the women in sport program, which I think essentially is the development of the Women's Sport Promotion Unit that was established following our inquiry into women's sport in the media. In particular, I want to highlight the quite extraordinary achievements under that program of the Sports Commission. The women's sports program has specific objectives to increase the quality and quantity of opportunities for women, to encourage participation and to facilitate the implementation of the Sports Commission's national policy and plan for women. By and large, it is an educational role that they have-an involving role but not a directly executive role-and I think that the program deserves congratulations, along with the Sports Commission, for what is being achieved for women in sport.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Reid and I were both participants at a seminar last week in Parliament House about women in sport, chaired jointly by the Sports Commission and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiring into the implementation of the sex discrimination legislation. I think that people were rather stunned at the number of submissions they had from people involved with women's sport saying that they are not getting a fair go. It was a very useful seminar. It highlighted the achievements to this point. It also pointed out the limitations still confronting women in sport. I will be looking forward to seeing the recommendations from that Committee and that inquiry, not only in the women in sport area but in all its terms of reference; of course, particularly in the women in sport area.

         —We are discussing the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990. To date, it has been an interesting debate. Of course, there has been reference to the fact that there has been a reversal of decision by the Government as to the particular matter that I wish to address; that is, the pre-charge detention procedures.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Prior to the change of Attorney-General, it seemed that the previous Attorney-General would regard `reasonable time' as the appropriate wording for this, and the new Attorney-General has limited it to a period of four hours. That has been referred to in the debate. I do not think that any of us quite understand why there was this change. But I found it reassuring that when Senator Cooney addressed the matter he said that he does not have a fixed mind on it. As he is Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I was pleased to hear that.
       </para>
       <para>
        As honourable senators know, after the second reading this Bill is to be referred to that Committee to look into that matter, in particular, and the other matters which Senator Spindler raised when he spoke. So the fact that Senator Cooney does have an open mind on this issue is important. There are aspects of it to be discussed most seriously.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill makes provision for the introduction of a fixed pre-charge custodial period in relation to Commonwealth offences. There are a number of other matters in the Bill which I shall not be dealing with and which are not opposed, but this is the one which I think most of us are opposing and feel quite strongly about. It makes a number of procedural safeguards in other areas relating to the rights of arrested persons. It was introduced on 15 November 1990. As I said, I support the basic principles underlying the Bill, as it seeks to provide checks and balances in the area of pre-charge detention. Tonight I will specifically deal with that section.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill makes provision for fixed pre-charge custodial periods for persons arrested in relation to Commonwealth offences, subject to the qualification that the period shall be what is considered reasonable for the individual case; such as periods not to exceed two hours for persons under the age of 18 years or for Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders and four hours in any other case. The Australian Democrats have suggested that the exclusion that I referred to for persons under the age of 18 years or Aboriginal persons should be extended to include those of diminished responsibility, those not fluent in English or those who are illiterate, so that the two-hour period would apply to all those as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I found it somewhat intriguing that Senator Spindler and the Australian Democrats are not prepared to allow police to determine what is reasonable as regards the time of questioning, but they are prepared to leave in the hands of police the determination as to whether or not the person in custody is of diminished responsibility, not fluent in English or illiterate. It is not always easy to determine who is illiterate. People who are illiterate develop extraordinary skills at hiding that fact. A person may not appear to be fluent in English or may appear to be fluent in English and in fact not have a great comprehension, or in fact have a great comprehension but not speak fluently.
       </para>
       <para>
        Who can determine a person of diminished responsibility among our fellow men or women? From time to time we might look at someone and wonder. We might feel certain, but we cannot be certain of that. Yet the Democrats would wish upon us amendments which seek to incorporate those exclusions and allow the police to make that decision. At the same time they say that a police officer is not competent to determine what is a reasonable time within which to question somebody. I really found it hard to follow the arguments that they were advancing. I do not believe that they can have it both ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill goes on to say that the relevant period-that is, the four hours which has been referred to-may be extended to an additional eight hours upon application to a magistrate. Senator Tambling, when he addressed the Bill, listed the difficulties that arose in determining whether four hours was a reasonable time or not and all the circumstances which go to limiting the value of that period. In my opinion, the four hour time limit will cause great problems in the policing and enforcement of justice, especially in the more serious and complex cases. I think that the fixed time limit benefits the more serious criminals and white collar criminals where a long interview is not only the norm but is absolutely unavoidable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The interim report of the review of Commonwealth law which dealt with detention before charge was of the clear opinion that the law should provide police officers, and others whose duty it is to investigate criminal offences, with a reasonable opportunity to interrogate an arrested person. I believe that few would disagree with that principle. The same review committee admitted-I refer to page 33 of the report-that the difficult question is whether the legislation should provide that an arrested person may be detained for a specific period or for a reasonable time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The discussion today addresses whether it should be a specific period or a reasonable time. Any discussion of this issue must attempt to strike a reasonable balance between the necessities of law enforcement and the protection of the individual, to provide a balance between combating the sophistication and the money of much of today's criminal activity while at the same time tying the hands of the investigators and, having done so, then criticising the police for failing to obtain the outcomes that one thinks ought to be obtained. I would say that in many instances eight hours is a very short period. I regard four hours as absolutely ludicrous.
       </para>
       <para>
        The review of Commonwealth law, which I have quoted, goes through the advantages of fixed periods for pre-charge detention, and they are listed. I want to refer to them because I think it is necessary that they are looked at as there is merit in some of them. They are as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. Such provisions provide the arrested person with a clear and sure protection against unduly prolonged detention.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. They render certain the power of the police to detain an arrested person for questioning.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. There is clarity and certainty as to the rights and obligations of all participants in the investigative process.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. They are likely to reduce the necessity to hold a voir dire for the purpose of determining whether a confession was illegally obtained.
       </para>
       <para>
        I interpose to say that I think one other aspect of the Bill which provides for recording overcomes that problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to refer to the Victorian Government's experience which I think is relevant. In 1983 concern that evidence was being rejected on the ground that it was obtained during a period of unlawful detention led the Victorian Government to appoint a committee to make recommendations for appropriate changes. As a result of the recommendations of that committee, the Victorian Parliament in 1984 amended the Victorian Crimes Act to provide for a prescribed period of detention, usually six hours, immediately after the person was taken into custody.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think Senator Spindler gave figures in his speech of the number of hours people were held in custody. It is a fact, as he said, that the committee found that 99.5 per cent of all interrogations had been completed within six hours. I had difficulty following his logic. He said that that being the case there should be a fixed period. It seems to me it would support the reverse. In the period he was referring to, I think he said that only 10 people had been interrogated for 18 hours or more. That again leads me to the conclusion that there ought not to be a fixed period.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the disadvantages of the fixed term period are quite apparent, especially when we look at the area in which the Commonwealth is operating. The six-hour period might well be inadequate in the case of complex investigations or multiple offences. Certainty is achieved, but at the expense of flexibility and practical efficiency. This is particularly relevant in the most serious cases, such as the illegal importation of drugs and complex conspiracies. The necessity to apply to extend the period tended to disrupt the continuity of the investigation. Practically, in some cases a justice or magistrate may not be available, especially in country areas, within the time fixed for charging or making application for an extension of the period of detention. There was a risk that the upper limit could come to be regarded as the norm-this has been mentioned in the debate-and that an arrested person might accordingly be detained for the maximum period, although that period was not necessary for the purposes of the investigation. Given the figure quoted in the Victorian review that 99.5 per cent of all interrogations were completed within the six hours-and six hours was the relevant time then in Victoria-I think there is a high probability of finding that in most of those cases the length of time a person was detained would, in fact, be far longer than it ought to be. That should be avoided.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Victorian committee concluded that the prescription of a fixed period was too inflexible and recommended that instead the police should be required to take an arrested person before a justice within a reasonable time. The courts will decide that in accordance with the common law. They decide many other things which are far more complex than this. I really fail to see why the Commonwealth is embarking on this path when I think the balance of evidence is that it has been tried and failed. Somehow we have to reinvent the wheel, and if it should happen to go through the Senate, I have no doubt that we will be spending time debating it again in a few years when we too seek to abandon it and get back to what is reasonable. It enables the courts to determine the issue and the case may be thrown out. That is the way it should be. In 1984 the Victorian Parliament abandoned it only 12 months or so after the initial six hours was put in. The Premier, Mr Cain, described the change as a `victory for commonsense'. Why do we not adopt commonsense right now in this debate?
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not an easy issue. The High Court's decision in the Williams case in 1986 has been referred to. There must be proper safeguards; nobody is suggesting that it should be otherwise. The person in custody must be protected. Any person must be free from arbitrary arrest, open-ended detention and unlawful and unfair treatment. It is my opinion that the effectiveness and efficiency of federal law enforcement and the discharge of justice should not be put at risk for the sake of what I see is ultimately an arbitrary time limit on pre-charge detention.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, this Bill introduces the recording of evidence. I think the warning that is given to somebody should be recorded; it should be apparent as to what occurred at that point in time in an interrogation and any confessions should be on tape. This modern technology is available and should be used.
       </para>
       <para>
        The imposition of a time constraint as a four-hour limit is totally impractical. It is likely to impede the course of justice and is totally against the public interest. Even if a concept of a fixed time is regarded as reasonable-and I suggest that it is not-and it is in the public interest, four hours is ludicrous. Six hours was found to be insufficient in Victoria in some of the cases that have been referred to. Most of them are less than that. One could ask the question: why are we dealing with it at all if 99.5 per cent of cases take less than that period of time? The United States of America and Scotland have adopted six hours, and the United Kingdom and Canada have longer periods.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal policing arena involves a high percentage of complex and advanced investigations; more so, I think, than many of the areas of State policing. The Federal Government's efforts-which should be encouraged-to eliminate organised crime and drug trafficking frequently involve investigations that are complex and critical. I find it remarkable that in this day and age, when we set up things like the National Crime Authority and we keep saying we want to wipe out organised crime and get rid of drug trafficking, we are pursuing a course here that is deliberately designed to inhibit the police in the operation of the work they are doing. We have the Victorian experience in front of us that flexibility in the length of interview is absolutely essential in solving complex and multiple crimes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The courts already exercise jurisdiction in many areas of the law. Judges are exercising their discretion on a daily basis. Judges and magistrates are experienced in making judgments of what is reasonable, and there are provisions for appeals against decisions. I believe that is adequate protection. There is no good reason why precedent and discretion with reference to the circumstances surrounding the investigation should not regulate reasonableness in this case. The courts are very vigilant, I believe, in ensuring that the slightest impropriety in the conduct of a police interview with an accused leads to the rejection of that interview as evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real issue comes back to whether the evidence and confessional material obtained during that period in custody is obtained voluntarily and fairly and without illegal conduct on the part of the police, and time really has nothing to do with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill incorporates several procedural safeguards that appear to me to be very adequate in protecting the civil liberties of those being investigated and questioned. Some, learned from the Victorian experience, relate to rights of communication, the right to silence, the voluntariness rules of admissibility of confessional material, cautioning, tape recording and dead time, and I support these wholeheartedly. For example, sound and video recording of police interviews is a sensible and long awaited protection for the police, the interviewee and the victim. It provides a mechanism for ensuring the total propriety of the interrogation process.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is my contention that the safeguards built into this Bill are more than adequate to protect the individual and to enable a reasonable balance to be struck between the requirements of law enforcement agencies and the need to protect civil liberties, without the need for a fixed time, pre-charge detention period, and certainly a fixed pre-charge detention period as short as four hours.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), like Senator Cooney, has an open mind on this and that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs can go into this question of the pre-charge detention period in some depth and come back to the Senate with a solution. I would be reluctant to have to support six or eight hours as a fixed period. Four, as I said, is absurd. I think the sensible and reasonable thing is to leave it as a reasonable time.

         —I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to this important second reading debate on the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990. The chamber and the Parliament are faced with a dilemma which the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has obviously faced. We need to make a choice as to how to balance two competing matters of great concern to the Attorney-General, as first law officer of the Crown, and to this chamber and the Parliament generally. We need to find a balance between, on the one hand, the civil liberties which we have inherited through the centuries in common law such as protects the individual against undue intimidatory tactics employed by those investigating offences in our community on behalf of the public and, on the other hand, the responsibility to ensure that laws are enforced, and that obviously requires vesting certain persons in our society with a real, effective capacity to undertake such investigations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is very hard to get that balance right. I must say that over the centuries the common law itself has maintained the same principles, adages or slogans, but has not always kept up with the fact that the structures of law enforcement have changed. There was a time in the early history of common law when the magistrate had a more inquisitorial function and actually asked questions concerning a person who was brought before the magistrate. In other words, there was an opportunity for the magistrate to actually carry out some questioning of the suspected offender.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is no longer the case. The rule that the High Court of Australia reaffirmed in the Williams case was that no questioning could be safely undertaken by police officers of a person whom they had arrested until the person was brought before a magistrate within a reasonable time-at the first practicable opportunity, in fact.
       </para>
       <para>
        Previously, it had been taken for granted that an arrested suspect, or a person who was aiding the police with their inquiries, could be questioned about an offence in the course of deciding upon what charges should be laid before taking him or her before a magistrate. The High Court in the Williams case threw that particular practice into relief against what was said to be common law principles which ought to apply. This is what has given rise to the dilemma. Parliaments around the Commonwealth have been faced with trying to get the balance right between the liberties of the subject and the need to have a practical means of investigating the possible commission of a crime, and the laying of relevant charges in relation to that criminal activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The jurisdictions have asked committees of great eminence to review the difficulty. For example, the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, under the former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, formed the clear opinion that the law should provide investigating officers with a reasonable opportunity to interrogate an arrested person and conduct other necessary investigations before taking the arrested person before a magistrate. It was recognised that the questioning of suspected persons is not, in itself, an evil thing or something which is inherently wrong, so long as there is no compulsion to answer questions; that there be no unfair or oppressive means of questioning; and that there are good reasons-that it is a necessary part of the law enforcement-why questioning be undertaken before a charge is laid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provided there are certain remedies or precautionary safeguards to ensure that the risks associated with that period of pre-charge detention do not come to reality, then I believe that the Parliament can provide a regime where civil liberties and law enforcement methods can be properly balanced, and that is what this legislation attempts to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to emphasise that nothing in this proposed legislation tries to give any extra powers to police to detain involuntarily somebody who is not under arrest. I do not want any confusion in this regard: there is no attempt in this legislation to say that the police can hold somebody against that person's will where the police officer has not formed a reasonable apprehension that an offence has been committed by that person such as would justify an arrest. This Bill does not seek to enable the police somehow to detain somebody against his will and question that person even though he has not been arrested. That is certainly not the case. There is no extension of the powers of arrest. The right to refuse to participate in any such questioning is not affected at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the Government and the Attorney have considered as appropriate is that there be a strictly defined reasonable investigation period within a specified maximum period of permissible pre-charge detention and that even within the maximum period of four hours, which is the initial and, perhaps, one hopes the normal, usual and permissible precharge detention time, the time has to be spent in the proper and relevant questioning of the person concerned. It may be that only one or two hours questioning is reasonable. It is a maximum within which the police, in asking their questions, have to act reasonably.
       </para>
       <para>
        But four hours is an initial maximum and can be inflated by the recognition of what is called dead time. This was not the case in the initial Victorian legislation. The framework which the Victorians initially put into place had a fixed time regime which did not have the flexibility that has been built into this proposal. For example, dead time refers to those periods of time which it is considered appropriate to exclude from the calculation of the investigation period, as they are all periods when investigation should not, in fairness, take place. They include direct travel time to the police station; time arranging communication with family, friend or lawyer; and time spent waiting for the attendance of a lawyer or prisoner's friend. One can see that in fact, for various reasons, the maximum four hours of investigation time might not be reached for some six hours after the person is detained by the police.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, it is quite clear that by application to a magistrate in appropriate circumstances, which are spelt out, the period of pre-charge investigation questioning can be extended to eight hours. Further questioning up to a maximum of eight hours is permitted. So I believe that there is a degree of flexibility built into this proposal, which is useful from the point of view of the police and also, in having that in-built requirement of reasonableness, protects the interests of the person who has at that stage not been charged.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Attorney-General has struck a reasonable balance in providing for a specified maximum time, which, of course, differs from the Opposition's preference for an open-ended reasonable time. Greater certainty is provided for the accused-if that is the exact expression; perhaps the person voluntarily assisting the police would be a better term-the legal representatives of that person and, of course, the police. The police themselves do not have to guess what a court might determine was or was not a reasonable time for pre-charge detention.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dead time provisions overcome most problems of the lack of flexibility complained of regarding the Victorian fixed time limit provision, where there was no allowance for dead time. I believe that the admissibility of confessions and so on will be made more certain. With objective compliance with these conditions, a clear regime will be in place. I believe that there are plenty of means-for example, in regard to extensions of time in remote areas, telephone or other electronic means are to be permitted-to make these provisions work well.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some other matters have been brought up during the second reading debate, particularly concerning the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issue. It is well known that the Bill includes the provision that for young persons, Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, the permissible maximum period of pre-charge detention will be two hours with an eight-hour extension, of course, able to be granted by a magistrate. I guess, at first glance it could be thought to be paternalistic or discriminatory. To a certain extent it certainly is discriminatory. But we are all aware that the setting up of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has particularly highlighted the risks associated with the initial period in custody; not the prison custody of a person convicted of an offence or even on some sort of formal remand, but the detention period, the initial period, in the police cells or where a person is being held before a charge is made or even before arrest.
       </para>
       <para>
        The public sittings and investigations of the Australian Law Reform Commission, particularly in Alice Springs and Darwin, revealed that in frequent cases bail was not even contemplated until the morning following an arrest of Aboriginal persons in the Northern Territory; and that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have a disproportionate contact with the criminal justice system, need to be protected because of their vulnerability to the abuse of power to overbear them and to hold them in pre-charge detention for long periods. The provision for young persons is self-explanatory and would not cause great concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps one of the more interesting parts of the Bill- certainly a very positive part and one which I am very happy that the Government found funds to underpin during the budgetary processes-is the provision which requires video taping or audio taping of the questioning undertaken during this pre-charge detention period. This is absolutely fundamental and will turn out to be a great advance, both for civil liberties and for law enforcement here in Australia, in relation to the investigation of Commonwealth offences.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of the structure of the Bill which is before the Senate, if a person who is in custody for a Commonwealth offence makes a confession or admission to an investigating official, the confession or admission is inadmissible as evidence against the person in proceedings for any Commonwealth offence unless the confession or admission was made in circumstances where it was reasonably practicable to tape record the confession or admission, and the questioning of the person and anything said by the person during the questioning was tape recorded.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other provisions but basically that is the central policy objective of this part of the Bill-that a confession or admission will be inadmissible unless it was tape recorded during the time of pre-charge questioning. That is a very important protection for the person engaging in the questioning session. It will also lead to a situation where confessions and admissions will be more easily brought into evidence in the proceedings of a criminal trial. It will save a lot of time where baseless allegations are made against police officers that `they verballed me'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence will be there from the beginning of the process of questioning where proper warnings will have to be recorded on the tape through to the end of the interview. The particular recording equipment will be of such a type that any interference with or break in the continuity of the recording session will immediately be apparent. This will be an extremely important protection which goes hand in hand with the permission which this Parliament would be giving to allow for questioning during this period of pre-charge detention.
       </para>
       <para>
        The High Court held that a confession obtained during this period, however voluntary, could be held to be inadmissible. I believe that, if the Parliament is to override that ruling of the High Court, amongst all the other protections in the statute, the tape-recording of confessions and admissions amounts to the most important and, I hope, effective protection of all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill does try to strike the right balance. I believe that we could all argue about whether the first Victorian proposal should be the one that is adopted, whether it should be the proposal that now commends itself to the Victorian Parliament or whether the period of initial maximum pre-charge detention should be four hours or six hours as the Gibbs Committee has recommended that it might be. These are all matters which are legitimate for discussion and debate. The Government has decided on the model of a maximum period with all the flexibility built into it through the provision of dead time and with the period of questioning having to be reasonable within the maximum limit. I believe that within that model there may still be room for argument about four hours, five hours, six hours, and so on.

        To answer Senator Reid, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will receive this Bill for consideration, and I believe that that will be a very fruitful review by that Committee. I do not believe that there will by any means be a blunt approach by either side. I hope that it will be a very useful Committee discussion. I look forward to the committee stage of the Bill. At the moment I thank all honourable senators from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats who have indicated their support for the second reading of the Bill, and I commend the motion to the chamber.

        —In speaking to the Insurance Amendment Bill 1990, I shall make a few comments about insurance generally because insurance has now become a very essential part of life. Insurance is the sharing of risks in whole or in part. There is not much that can now be done in business of any sort where insurance is not necessary and required. Of course, insurance is broken into two fairly even parts: one is safeguarding the present and the other is safeguarding the future.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       But insurance involves money and wherever money is involved, crime automatically follows or goes hand in hand. I do not mean that it is only the public who are to blame because in many cases the companies themselves fail to present their case and their cause in a reasonable and just manner. Some sell very poor cover and sell it very badly but the vast majority of companies and offices are first class and most responsible.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has always been my experience that there are far too many misunderstandings in insurance. Too many people do not know; do not remember; are not told of some of the intricacies of the policies at the time they are taking out insurance; have problems with the terminology used; do not know what they get with fire insurance; do not know the difference between householders insurance and comprehensive insurance; hear people quoting what they have been paid by way of a loss, and so on.
      </para>
      <para>
       In business we have matters such as excess clauses and certain policies are subject to average. There is also the question of storm and tempest cover, which has been very widely commented on this year and the difficulty that arises is whether it includes or excludes flood and matters such as this. It really does require not only the companies but also the people insured to be more careful about the class of insurance taken out and exactly what is covered. People should read their insurance policies. They should know what they are covered for and they should know what the exclusions are.
      </para>
      <para>
       Car insurance is now almost universal and has become a very big business on its own. That is largely because car stealing has become such a huge business, such a major crime, in most cities. We are now told that, amongst the car stealing fraternity, people only have to say the make, the model and the colour of the car wanted and those involved in car stealing will get it. We are also in an age of court decisions regarding professional negligence, accident and injury, and third party. These judgments now being handed down are making insurance very expensive and very difficult to get. This is changing the whole question of liability very much indeed. It is now becoming necessary for people to spend more and more of the money that they would otherwise use in other household or business ways on keeping themselves in line with the law.
      </para>
      <para>
       Insurance provides backing for loans and mortgages, whether in business, in housing or whatever. An insurance policy, such as life insurance cover, provides security when people want to get a mortgage on a building or other type of loan. A fire insurance policy is also necessary. It is possible to borrow 90 per cent, or even 100 per cent, provided people have the mortgage insured. But the losses that are now accruing in insurance generally are tremendous.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was looking at the annual report of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in this regard. On page 116 of this year's annual report I noted that the premiums paid for fire and general insurance to 1989 amounted to $12,293m for the year. An enormous amount of money is now being paid for insurance. Many of these claims involve the crime of arson, which is generally regarded as being the easiest crime to commit and to get away with. It makes our insurance very expensive. I remember a few years ago being told that insurance premiums for fire insurance could be halved were it not for arson.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is an enormous amount to keep in mind. Currently the estimates are something between $200m and $800m a year. The crime of arson has inadequate resources devoted to it. It requires a lot more attention and a lot more policing, but it is just not possible to provide those facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, it then comes back to what is now referred to as the `bottom line' in business. Page 120 of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission report shows the deficits for all classes of insurance for the last five years: $569m for 1985; $800m for 1986; $717m for 1987; $583m for 1988; and $687m for 1989. To eliminate even those is again going to require a great increase in premiums.
      </para>
      <para>
       At present the losses are being covered by insurance company investments, not by premiums. Of course, the biggest items in those losses are not the traditional fire covers, but motor vehicle insurance and employers' liability. In the year of this report, 1989, there was a loss on motor vehicle insurance of $270m and a loss on employers' liability of $111m. So it goes on. We have to be able to cover those things. They have to be paid for. The attitude that it does not matter if one cheats a little because it is only an insurance company, I am afraid, has become far too common in our community.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also, of course, far too easy for a business that has become unprofitable or premises that have become obsolete to have one of those unfortunate fires. Recently studies have been done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and others of the commencement of fires, with a view to trying to cope with more of these criminal acts. The research has improved, but we still need a lot more.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we get around to insuring the future, we are talking about life insurance and superannuation. Again these are very big figures; it is a vast business. Page 91 of the report shows that the new business written, that is, the amount insured for the particular year, was $108 billion. That is going to mature some time in the future and require to be paid out, but it is growing at a very fast rate. That showed an increase of 23.5 per cent on the year before, which was again 24.1 per cent up on the year before that. People have become very conscious of insurance and superannuation and are putting a lot of money into them now, and quite reasonably so.
      </para>
      <para>
       At present the assets are in the order of $90 billion, but the money that is there is a matter of some concern to many people. All sorts of people, all sorts of organisations, governments and so on look at this money and work out how they can get their hands on it or how they can influence its expenditure. It is a bit worrying that there are so many people thinking about it because sooner or later somebody is going to try to get their hands on it to see how they can wheedle it away for some other purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is the money that is going to largely determine Australia's future. How these huge amounts of money are going to be invested and the responsibility that that places on management to see that they are reasonably placed is important. Placed wrongly, of course, we will start to get a lot of investment and development distortion. Placed correctly, it can look after the future of Australia for the next century or so.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have seen many companies and businesses that have been in a make or break situation, depending on what the insurance companies have done with their assets. I am not saying whether it was made or broken, but we have only to take the case of Ansett Transport Industries. It got sold because the AMP Society decided to cash its shares. I do not think that these big owners of shares, particularly the life insurance companies, take enough responsibility for the shareholdings they own. I believe that they move in and out of the market with little responsibility; they do not get seats on boards, even when they get up to holding approximately 20 per cent of the shares. When they should be involved, they do not do it. I believe that companies which are going to have such an effect on the market should be more responsible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Insurance companies and superannuation funds quite often appear to me to have the impression that the whole purpose of insurance is the perpetuation of the company and of the staff and directors that run with it. It is not. The interests of the policy holder have got to be the prime consideration. I guess that if we all stopped for a moment it would not take as long to think of those sorts of companies that we know only too well, where perpetuation of the staff seems to be what it is all about. That is a most important issue, and I think it needs to be watched very carefully.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is one other example: I notice that the ICA Bulletin for February 1990 gave a run-down of the decade of the 1980s. To give the Senate an idea of the sort of work that insurance does, it covered year by year the major disasters that caused insurance so much difficulty. In every year of the 1980s cyclones, floods and bush fires took their toll, with a total insurance bill exceeding $2.2 billion for the decade. In the past decade, average daily pay-outs in respect of natural disasters increased from an estimated $11m every working day in 1980 to $27m per day in 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       Two months into the decade Cyclone Dean whipped through the Pilbara, causing $38.7m damage. Fire destroyed 25 homes and 75 farms in the Adelaide hills-$25.2m. At the end of the year Brighton, Queensland, left insurers to pick up a bill for $28.5m. Floods and storms in Dalby, Queensland, three months later cost $38.7m. Ash Wednesday in February 1983 cost insurance a total of $253m. Heavy rain in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, in November 1984 caused damage worth $103.3m. During 1985 more bush fires in Victoria and South Australia and violent storms in Brisbane and Melbourne took their toll-$257m. In 1985 hail storms in Brisbane were the worst that Queensland had experienced for years-$216m. Cyclone Winifred crossed the north Queensland coast near Innisfail in February 1986-$50m. Extraordinary rain and hail caused $125.8m worth of damage in Sydney's western suburbs in October 1986. Victoria's freak storms in November saw many roofs blown off-$9.6m. Heavy rains whipped across Queensland and New South Wales and caused more than $11m worth of damage in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, during April 1988. Weeks of rain left a total damages bill of more than $47.8m.
      </para>
      <para>
       The following month the tail end of Cyclone Herbie caused $22m damage. Later that year, the north-western coast of Western Australia experienced severe storms causing $8.6m damage. In November, wild winds battered Melbourne, causing $11.8m damage. In April 1989 a cyclone struck the Queensland coast at Alva Beach near Ayr, causing $27m worth of damage. Australia was relatively disaster-free for seven months until November 1989 when hailstorms and heavy rains caused more than $30m damage in Ballarat, Moe, the Melbourne suburbs, Sydney and Brisbane. The decade ended on a disastrous note: on 28 December 1989 Newcastle experienced a devastating earthquake with damage worth over $600m.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is what insurance is all about. This is why people require insurance. Even though we are dealing with only a small piece of legislation tonight, it is important. The Bill seeks to amend the Insurance Act 1973. I believe it is quite a good, concise Act. I think the Act is in good order and condition, but I understand that a full replacement is contemplated. However, the legislation before us tonight relates only to section 37 of the Act. Section 37 provides for a monetary limit up to which a small insurer may collect premiums without the necessity for a full reporting which the Act otherwise requires. The limit on this amount of premium income is currently set at $500,000, having been raised from $200,000 in 1984. It is now proposed to raise this amount to $750,000 and in due course to permit the limit to be adjusted by regulation. I have a preference that these sorts of issues should be dealt with in legislation and be subject to parliamentary consideration whenever changes are proposed. However, the Opposition will not oppose the proposal on this occasion. We support the Bill.

        —The Senate is debating the Insurance Amendment Bill 1990. The Insurance Act 1973 regulates the non-life insurance industry. The Act was amended in 1983 to strengthen the supervision of the industry by increasing the minimum paid-up capital and solvency requirements, updating penalties and improving the reporting and accounts provisions.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Section 37 of the Act provides an exemption from various reporting requirements to insurers whose activities are confined to conducting insurance business with limited classes of persons, generally only members or employees of a company or a particular trade, industry or profession, and whose annual premiums do not exceed $500,000. The threshold figure applying before the 1983 amendments was $200,000. The Australian Democrats did not oppose the increase in the threshold on that occasion. The Bill seeks to amend section 37 in two ways: firstly, to increase the premium limit to $750,000 to restore the real value of the exemption, thereby enabling one of the insurers to continue to be covered by the provision, and, secondly, to allow the limit to be adjusted upwards by regulation.
      </para>
      <para>
       As Senator Archer said, and I agree with him, it is preferable to make such changes by legislation rather than by regulation. However, it is a fact, of course, that such regulations come before the Senate and we are able to disallow regulations if we disagree with them. The Australian Democrats on this occasion also will support both those amendments.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are a number of other matters in the insurance industry that I would like to take this opportunity to comment on. In the first instance there are the recent problems which Regal and Occidental has experienced and which are now before the courts. As a result of these problems the Government has proposed a levy on life offices to bail out any shortfall which may arise after the legal proceedings have been concluded. This proposal raises many issues and the Australian Democrats continue to have this particular issue under consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government also proposes to strengthen the minimum capital requirements of the Life Insurance Act. We welcome this move to strengthen the prudential supervision of life offices. It is well known that the Government has been reviewing the Life Insurance Act for years. It is interesting that it has taken this crisis to prod the Government into action on these issues. I trust that we will have legislation before us soon. Clearly, strong regulation of the financial sector is desperately needed. The problems that have come to light in regard to Regal and Occidental are only part of a long string of such problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       We currently have the debacle of the South Australian State Bank's problems over its finance subsidiary which points to the need for Federal regulation of the non-bank financial sector. In addition, we have, of course, the examples of the Pyramid Building Society in Victoria, the State Bank of Victoria and the Estate Mortgage unlisted trust. The list goes on. It is in response to this clearly ineffective prudential supervision of our financial system that I have introduced my private member's Bill into the Senate to achieve a national scheme of strong and effective prudential supervision for non-bank financial institutions. Recent events, of course, have shown that these failings exist also in the banking sector. The Reserve Bank's methods of supervising that sector, with particular reference to the South Australian State Bank, have been admitted by Mr Fraser recently.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another problem that must be dealt with, apart from prudential supervision, is the question of the capital backing of the fund management activities of banks, as they increasingly enter the fields traditionally dominated by the life offices. Many other insurance issues remain unresolved. The Democrats have been advocating a better deal for consumers in that area for some years. We believe that independent ombudsmen need to be appointed, along the lines of the banking ombudsman, in the areas of general insurance, life insurance and superannuation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn now to the issue of outrageous fees for insurance and superannuation products, which has still not been addressed adequately by the Government. A report in Tuesday's Australian Financial Review shows that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is still not adequately confronting the issue. I also agree with the remarks made in the debate on this Bill in the other place by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) about the insidious practice of twisting undertaken by some unscrupulous agents. Twisting involves agents going to a previous client or to a new client whom they know is involved with a rival insurance company. The client is then convinced to enter into a new insurance contract which generates new fees for the agent and which in most cases ensures that no benefits, or rather reduced benefits, accrue to the client for the first two years during which the payments are made on the new contract. Self-regulation by the industry has not stopped this practice. Clearly, some stronger measures are needed in that area.
      </para>
      <para>
       The last issue I would like to touch on in this debate concerns the availability of capital for Australia's small business sector. We must ensure that the magnificent efforts of our researchers and inventors yield commercial benefits not only to them but also to the community. Today's Australian newspaper documents yet another result of Australian research being developed offshore. A new diagnostic and screening kit developed by the Protein and Enzyme Technology Research Centre at Monash University has been licensed to a Japanese firm after failure to develop the project in Australia, apparently due to a takeover in 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       Clearly, our existing financial system arrangements have failed in this regard. Happily, Senator Button has acknowledged this on many occasions. Hopefully, next week's industry statement will address this issue by a proposal to establish an equity fund which could attract some of the growing resources accumulating in superannuation funds. I await with interest the Government's policy proposals in these matters.

        —The debate on the second reading of the Insurance Amendment Bill has been appropriate for what is essentially a straightforward and noncontentious Bill, but a Bill that deals with an Act that covers very important issues generally and issues of very significant current concern to a lot of Australians. It is not appropriate at this stage in deliberations of the Senate when we are trying to pass a lot of legislation to pursue all the issues raised by honourable senators; they were important. I would love the opportunity to debate some of the very important questions about investment and about people taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions, whether by cheating on insurance or as the consequences of their actions as agents or the consequences of their actions as people with enormous funds under their control for investment. All of those are important social issues of current and continuing concern.

       But with regard to the Bill itself, I welcome the support of both honourable senators who spoke and the parties they represented. They raised one issue of particular concern; the changing of the threshold by regulation. This was a matter which immediately leapt to my attention because it is one regularly raised by the Senate. But in addition to the points which both honourable senators raised, about the fact that it is reviewable, the other point to note is that it is only possible for the Commissioner to exercise this discretion to the advantage of the citizen; it can be exercised only to increase the threshold. So, for those two reasons, I think the response of the Government, the Opposition and the Democrats is appropriate, and I welcome the support for the Bill.

       </para>
       <para>
        The Convention was adopted at the Fifteenth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law in 1984 as part of its work in promoting the unification of private international law. As a member of the Conference, Australia participated actively in its work on the Convention. The Convention will enter into force after 3 countries have ratified it (Article 30).
       </para>
       <para>
        Although a number of both common law countries (the United States, United Kingdom and Canada) and civil law countries (Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) have signed the Convention, only the UK and Italy have yet ratified it.
       </para>
       <para>
        As its name suggests, the Bill deals with the law applicable to trusts and the recognition of trusts. Trusts are essentially an equitable institution which has developed in legal systems based on the English common law-the concept of a trust is generally not used in civil law systems based on the roman law model. A trust may be described as an equitable obligation which binds a person (called a trustee) to deal with some specific property (the trust property) for the benefit of persons (called the beneficiaries) or for the advancement of some specific purpose. In the common law world trusts have been developed to serve a variety of functions, ranging from charitable purposes and estate planning to vehicles of commerce.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Convention is intended to overcome potential conflict of laws problems which may arise where aspects of a trust-such as its assets, beneficiaries or trustees-have connections with more than one jurisdiction. If the trust concept is not recognised in one of those jurisdictions, as is the case in civil law jurisdictions, the very existence and validity of the trust may be in doubt. Even among common law jurisdictions which recognise trusts, there may sometimes be different rules for ascertaining the law to govern the trust and its incidents. The Convention provides a common regime of rules governing both the recognition of trusts and the determination of which law is applicable to the trust.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Convention is largely for the benefit of common law countries such as Australia, in that it requires civil law countries to recognise a purely common law institution while conferring benefits on common law countries or their citizens who are likely to be beneficiaries of a trust. There will be no incentive for civil law countries to be party to the Convention if common law countries are seen to lack interest in it. For this reason, early implementation of the Convention in Australia is desirable, to enable accession in the near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION
       </para>
       <para>
        The Schedule to the Bill reproduces the Convention, which is divided into Chapters and Articles. Chapter I outlines the scope of the Convention and defines whether something is a trust covered by the Convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        Chapter II identifies the national law applicable to any particular trust. Prima facie the governing law is the law chosen expressly or impliedly by the settlor, that is, the person creating the trust. Where no choice is made, the governing law is the law of the country with which the trust is most closely connected. These rules will serve to clarify existing choice of law rules, which are far from clear.
       </para>
       <para>
        Chapter III deals with the extent to which a trust is to be recognised in accordance with the applicable law by states that become parties to the Convention. Such recognition involves, as a minimum, that the trust property exists as a separate holding and that the trustee may bring and defend proceedings in his or her capacity as trustee. As a separate holding, the trust property will have a legal existence separate from other property in general and from the trustee's own property in particular. Thus, the trustee's personal creditors will not have any recourse to the trust property, though that property may be held in the name of the trustee.
       </para>
       <para>
        Chapter IV contains a number of general articles, several of which limit the effect of the Convention in particular circumstances, where there are good reasons either for a trust not being recognised at all or for the governing law determined in accordance with the Convention being ignored in favour of some other law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Chapter V contains final articles dealing with signature, ratification, accession, reservations and entry into force of the Convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        ADVANTAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION FOR AUSTRALIA
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will enable Australia to ratify the Convention and, once the Convention enters into force, to bring its provisions into force for Australia. The major advantage of the Convention arises when property subject to a trust is located within the jurisdiction of a civil law contracting state to the Convention. The practical effect of Australia acceding to the Convention would be that the true ownership of Australian trust property in the territory of a civil law party would be recognised and respected.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, the law governing a trust with aspects extending over more than one jurisdiction is determined in Australia by common law rules of conflict of laws. The Convention is largely consistent with the Australian common law rules of conflict of laws. Adoption of the Convention would not require amendment of existing Australian statute law and would not cause substantial changes to existing Australian law.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, the Convention would not impose new obligations on Australian courts to give effect to fraudulent or otherwise ``undesirable'' trusts. The Convention provides merely for the determination of which law applies to a trust. Moreover, the Convention allows precedence to be given to a contracting state's public policy (Article 18), mandatory laws relating to insolvency, succession, transfer of property, exchange controls, protection of cultural property, etc (Articles 15 and 16) and exercises of a contracting state's fiscal powers (Article 19).
       </para>
       <para>
        SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATION
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth legislation will apply the Convention only to ``international'' trusts, where the law of a foreign country is potentially applicable, and not extend it to solely domestic or ``interstate'' trusts to which the law of another Australian State or Territory is potentially applicable. The Convention specifically allows a federal state to refrain from applying the Convention to conflict of laws between its territorial units (Article 24). The Commonwealth legislation would not prevent States and Territories from themselves legislating, as some have indicated an interest in doing, to apply the rules of the Convention to ``interstate'' trusts. The Commonwealth legislation is quite simple, merely adopting in Australia the terms of the Convention subject to the reservation regarding non-applicability as between Australian States and Territories.
       </para>
       <para>
        COMMONWEALTH-STATE IMPLICATIONS
       </para>
       <para>
        Within Australia trusts are generally a matter of State/Territory law and the Convention could be implemented in Australia either by uniform State/Territory legislation or by Commonwealth legislation. As the Convention has no effect on statute law, has the minimal possible effect on common law conflict of laws rules and is essentially concerned with international trusts, the Government has decided that it would be most simply and conveniently implemented by Commonwealth legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Convention was considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 1987 and the States and Territories have accepted this course of action. It is understood that the States and Territories, or some of them, might later enact legislation to apply the rules of the Convention to ``interstate'' trusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        CONCLUSION
       </para>
       <para>
        The choice of law rules in the Convention are very similar to the existing common law choice of law rules. The qualifications on recognition contained in the Convention may appear to detract from the value of the Convention to common law countries, but they were essential in order for the civil law countries to agree to the draft Convention and their existence will be of prime importance in persuading such countries to ratify the Convention. The Convention's value is that it establishes a framework and scheme for recognition of trusts and perhaps also an expectation of their recognition. Its adoption will result in a substantial improvement over the present situation.

        —We are debating the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. On behalf of Senator Bishop I would like to foreshadow an amendment to the motion. The object of this Bill is to amend the principal Act, the Industry Research and Development Act 1986, with the following objectives: firstly, to extend the grants for the industry research and development scheme as administered by the Industry Research and Development Board in line with last August's Budget, and to make minor adjustment changes to those operations; secondly, to bring the national procurement and development program under the Act; and, thirdly, to amend the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 in order to allow the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to accept gifts of up to $1m without having to obtain ministerial approval.

        —The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill is an important Bill. I will be moving an amendment at the conclusion of my speech, which simply says that we will be condemning the Government yet again for its incapacity to allow the Australian economy to survive and, indeed, generally notes that the extension of the schemes as provided for in the Bill, specifically those under the grant for industry research and development (GIRD) scheme, is further evidence of the Government's failure to make our economy work.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The words are couched in technological language but the sentiment remains firm. On my behalf, Senator Parer outlined the intent of the Bill, which very simply is to extend the grants for industry, research and development scheme. The Bill will have a financial impact of ensuring that those grants will total approximately $32m over the next four years. The national procurement development program is to be brought within the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 rather than continuing to operate under delegation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The extension of the various schemes in the Industry Research and Development Board are expressive of deeper difficulties in commercialising technology and establishing high technology industries in Australia. The fact that they are put in the position in the first place of having to force or contrive industry and research linkages attests to a fundamental weakness in the commercialisation process at work in the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has led us to believe that Australia's economic and industrial future will be characterised by the development of a new generation of high technology in manufacturing; but, quite frankly, this has not come to pass. Increasingly over the course of the past two decades, more successful economies have exploited innovative product development, advanced and flexible manufacturing processes and high returns to small and medium volume niche markets, but Australia has failed to adapt or evolve its manufacturing sector in this way. Australia has failed to integrate high technology production strategies within the industrial sector and has therefore crippled opportunities to create the sort of industrial base which feeds off and contributes to the research base.
      </para>
      <para>
       The nature of the GIRD scheme has the potential to establish the conditions for industry development, especially in the high technology industries, but it is not easy. There is a need to draw broader policy initiatives which address macro and micro policy settings. If this does not happen and if the overall across-the-economy conditions are not supportive of secure investment climates and improved productivity, the chances of building up a real base for a particular industry or industry grouping will prove difficult indeed.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are examples which are useful to illustrate the problems facing the enhancement of technology. Australia has great potential in various areas of the information related industry. As it is an area in which Australia has a trade deficit of $4 billion-$10 billion by 1996-it is also of critical economic significance. The Government has had in place an industry strategy designed to consolidate its areas of strength and provide the conditions for establishing smaller start-up companies within the domestic market, but that very strategy is foundering on the Government's failings on broader economic strategy.
      </para>
      <para>
       High interest rates and the recession have taken their toll on the fragile local industry, particularly on the software and component sectors, which depend on continuing demand from users. The disruption in demand caused by the recession is crippling these fledgling industries. Growth in the Australian information industry sector has been slashed by half as a result of the recession, representing a loss of $11.45 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       How does the Government reconcile this deliberately engineered recession with the impact this will have on emerging local information related industries? Already in the past year the industry recorded its first drop in profit in 12 years. Its growth has fallen below the consumer price index at 5.7 per cent; investment has fallen 13 per cent and is still falling; and imports massively outweigh exports-$444m versus $2.4 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is significant to note the important role played by the government sector in adding to the import bill of information technology generally. It is extraordinary that Australia is the eighth largest market in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of the sale of information technology. As a country of only 17 million people, we have a huge import bill. Indeed, in the last reconciled figures that I have seen, information technology represented our largest single import.
      </para>
      <para>
       At least 50 per cent of information technology purchases is made by government. As we still maintain a cash accounting system, information technology has a value in the year in which it was purchased, but the very next year it virtually does not have to be accounted for nor accorded a value. We have the situation where it is open to a department to say simply, `I think we might have a little toy because the other fellows have got one'. We have no real information about whether the equipment purchased is doing something useful or whether the department could have done without it. It is a serious problem when we realise that this is an import cost to this country; at the same time the ingenuity that we have in Australia is being disadvantaged.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I said, business spending on computer systems and networks in the private sector is a very low 1.3 per cent and falling, whereas overseas companies spend more than that. But it is significant to note that the public sector is the largest buyer of information technology in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, it is interesting to look at what happens to Australian companies when they are, quite frankly, disadvantaged by problems of the Government pursuing its macro-economic policies. Delen Corporation, located in South Australia, which produced printed circuit boards, tried to offset some of the $100m a year we spend on imported PCBs and was set to negotiate a $14.5m export contract with Digital Equipment Corporation (Australia) Pty Ltd. The plan could have produced about 12,000 square metres of printed circuit boards per month if it were working at capacity. This would have been worth something in the vicinity of $30m to $40m in annual sales. But the collapse of local orders, caused by the recession-the recession we had to have; the one that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) personally engineered and pulled the levers for-forced that plant to close its doors last year. The firm is being propped up by grants from the South Australian State Government in order to find an equity partner but, with little demand for product, the search may prove difficult.
      </para>
      <para>
       The collapse of economic activity caused by the deliberately engineered recession has also struck at the skills base in the industry at a time when we need those skills to be maintained in this country. Although the long term skills needs of industry remain formidable, the irony is that the computer programmers and others skilled in the computer sciences are being retrenched. As an example, witness the closure of the Commonwealth-funded Victorian computer industry training course which was terminated because it was, and I quote from the December bulletin of the Australian Computer Society (Inc), `an unfortunate casualty of the recession'. For the many who have been forced into bankruptcy, into financial penury and into seeing sometimes decades of work collapse around their ears, `an unfortunate casualty of the recession' is an awful phrase to use to explain the plight of Australians. How does the Government reconcile the need to maintain and develop the skills base for the information sector with its economic policies that are driving the computer programmers onto the unemployment queues? Those queues are growing at a rate which has knocked the final leg from under this Government's record. When we were looking various performance indicators of the Government's record, so many times we would hear, `Ah, yes, but we made employment grow; we do not have the same unemployment rates that we had under the previous administration of the coalition'. Of course, that plea has now been knocked sideways too as unemployment figures continue to grow at an unconscionable rate.
      </para>
      <para>
       The recession has hit at many tiers. There were many who were quite shocked at the closure of the Black and Decker plant when it pulled up stakes from its high-tech Croydon plant in Melbourne in late January, preferring to import its power tool product rather than manufacture locally. It was doing everything right. It had enlightened, experienced management which had put in place a coherent technology and business strategy. It incorporated advanced management training. It was a state of the art plant which used robotic production lines. It was doing its bit. It had a reputation for keeping down its overheads and for extracting every efficiency possible. It produced a product which retained its commercial prominence because of a constant push to improve quality and design standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was about achievement of excellence, and yet it failed to sustain its local high- tech manufacturing capability because it simply could not compete on costs with internationally manufactured products. It could not be competitive, and therefore it had to close. It could not win the big international contracts because it was uncompetitive on price.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why was it uncompetitive? I refer to the Business Council of Australia report, which I mentioned earlier, and which said that if we do not compete internationally our standard of living will collapse. According to the former managing director of Black and Decker, Mr Kevin Cashman, falls in protection were taking place without the offsetting or compensating micro-economic reforms. I refer to the micro- economic reforms which were promised to be the feature of the previous Hawke Administration prior to the election, but we still do not see the real economic reforms taking place.
      </para>
      <para>
       The same issue has crippled the viability of high technology chemical industries. Mr Cashman, however, pointed out that there had been no improvement in the handling of the labour market. He said that the costs of the domestically operated transport network, especially the waterfront, had robbed the company of its price competitiveness.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again and again from the Opposition benches we have said that there must be deregulation of the labour market, that there must be the ability to have enterprise agreements. We have said that there must be significant reform on the waterfront, and not the sort of thing that is simply a golden handshake for selective, shall I say, and more elderly wharf labourers who in many cases could be said to be replaced by sons-almost a dynasty or an image that is being perpetuated.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It has cost Australia Black and Decker because that company could no longer compete. In fact, a Government survey blames current economic policies for the lack of manufacturing export growth. The report of the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) entitled Impediments to Manufactured Exports released last month shows that Australian businesses are clamouring to enter overseas markets but are undercut by poor levels of labour productivity and other cost factors. The report, based on a survey of 1,200 manufacturing firms, essentially discredits Government efforts to focus its industry policy solely on providing aid to manufacturers by way of subsidies and other export assistance schemes. In other words, the Government has only embraced bandaid measures. Unless we attack the underlying problems, we will not be competitive and will be unable to maintain our standard of living.
      </para>
      <para>
       The respondents to the BIE survey singled out labour costs, the high cost of capital, the inefficiency again of the waterfront, and inefficiencies in the transport sector as the key reasons for the failure to break into new markets. The message of the study was clear. Australian firms do not need handouts, and indeed they do not want them. They simply want to be freed from the basic inefficiencies of the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The BIE survey indicated difficulties in competing on prices as a major obstacle in winning a bigger share of export markets. That is a point with which Kevin Cashman of Black and Decker would no doubt feel in sympathy. The BIE also said that other countries such as West Germany and Sweden have been able to pay higher wages than Australia and yet be successful exporters. I think it is quite significant to acknowledge that the competitive edge that Germany is enjoying or has enjoyed through the 1980s in its toolmaking capacity has been significant, as other economies have needed those toolmaking manufactures in order to build up their own economies. Germany has been efficient in meeting that demand.
      </para>
      <para>
       In those countries where there has been so much advance, the difference is in the area of labour productivity. The study reveals that the rush to embrace a new generation of protection and assistance schemes only represents economic tinkering. It does not matter by what name protectionism is called. It does not matter whether it is called strategic trade theory, a new development to enhance profitability, or anything else; if it is protection, in the end the interests of an industry are not served.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our experience of the 1950s and 1960s, when we built tariff walls of protection around us, teaches us the lesson that we must learn in the 1990s if we are to maintain our standard of living. Until such time as the Government is able to set its industry policies within the context of an efficient economy, the fantasy of rebuilding the nation's high technology manufacturing base will never be realised. It has to be soundly based.
      </para>
      <para>
       Schemes such as these that are before the Senate are in their effect limited in terms of impact in doing anything significant to reconstruct the commercialisation process in the economy.

       In moving that amendment, I make clear that we will not be voting against the Bill.

One acknowledges that we still have two more tedious and grinding years of bad management, poor administration and suffering by the Australian people before we can see light at the end of the tunnel, with a change in government which will inevitably come.

        —I rise to speak for the Australian Democrats on the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill seeks to amend several other pieces of legislation and, as has already been pointed out, to extend the grants for industry, research and development scheme, known as GIRD, for a further four years with approximately $32m per annum, and also to extend the national procurement development program to June 1992. They may well be extended beyond those times, as the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) pointed out in his second reading speech, but the latter will be reviewed at that time.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It also seeks to make various other amendments. I am pleased to see that the use of the standard international units will be given effect by this legislation. That is something which is long overdue and which makes the meshing of scientific understanding of matters and trade matters much simpler if one standard international set of units is used. It also allows the use of derived units. The Minister mentions litres per minute or some such example, which will be a useful legal clarification.
      </para>
      <para>
       Turning to the main section of the Bill, the Democrats would have no criticism of this Bill as far as it goes, but we use this occasion to point out that while some of the things which the previous speaker, Senator Bishop, pointed out in relation to micro-economic reform and the need to improve the efficiency of industry may well have some substance-I think that the Minister is already turning his attention to some of those things-our primary criticism is that this Government has really lacked vision as to where it wants to position Australia in the decades ahead.
      </para>
      <para>
       I return to a theme which I developed in speaking to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which is looking at the greenhouse issue, and reiterate that what we as a country must recognise is that human beings are not free to do what they like with the environment and we do work within very serious constraints. Those constraints are impacting on us in a way which, unless we take notice of those restraints and unless we make our industry conform within those restraints-indeed, unless we make our whole society conform within those constraints-there will be no society at all. The upside of recognising those constraints and making industry fit with that is that we will have industry which fulfils the needs not only of Australia but of world markets in the years ahead.
      </para>
      <para>
       I point again to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which pointed out that there is an urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 60 to 80 per cent. That would not bring greenhouse gases down to a level where they were before industrialisation began; that is merely to cause them to stabilise at a much higher level with very considerable greenhouse consequences, which at this stage in the development of our global industrial lifestyle we simply cannot avoid. As I pointed out before, if we are also to observe the need for international equity in relation to access to resources, Australia must do much better than that. Indeed, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 92 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       While it is certainly true that the signs of greenhouse warming and the consequences in terms of climate change, sea level rise and so on are not yet unequivocally evident, the best scientific evidence available, which came from the IPCC committee, is that those signals will become absolutely unequivocal by early in the next century. If we think that we are going to build industry simply by invoking the buzzwords `high tech', `micro-economic reform', `working harder' or `clever country' and we are going to solve Australia's problems and the world's problems, then I am afraid that we are well on the way to going down the gurgler along with everybody else.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia is in a position to take note of this best scientific advice-and that is what this Bill is substantially about-and to start putting its research funds deliberately into those industries which are oriented towards energy efficiency in the first instance and towards renewable energy as we find the need to replace the sources of energy supply which we currently use. What do we find when we look at what this Government has done in that light? We find, for instance, that the research funds which have gone through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) grant scheme into renewable energy have declined by a factor of eight in real terms since 1978. I will read from a brief paper by Professor Kaneff of the Australian National University in the journal Solar Progress. He states:
      </para>
      <para>
       The real values of NERDDC grants for Renewable Energy R&amp; have now dropped to about one-eighth of the 1978 grants. Taking into account the drop in the Australian dollar over this period, and the fact that R&amp; equipment often needs to be purchased from overseas, the real value of grants has dropped more than an order of magnitude.
      </para>
      <para>
       In other words, it is more than a factor of ten. The article goes on to deal with the individual areas in some detail and then turns to his own particular area of excellence and one in which this year the United States will be building in California a solar thermal power station of over 600 megawatts. Speaking of Australia, he says:
      </para>
      <para>
       This lack of recognition is most evident in relation to solar thermal power employing medium and high temperature for which less than 2 per cent of the total grant monies has been allocated. Yet this area offers one of the very few ways in which renewable energy can be used on a mass scale and so make a major contribution to total energy resources. Curiously, this fact is realised overseas far more than it is in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wanted to point to one particular defect which I find in this Bill and in many other Bills which the Government is bringing forth. It is the lack of a clear vision of where we need to position this country and its industry in the next 10 to 15 years so as to meet the objectives. I stress again that the very best scientific evidence that we have available to us indicates that it will be absolutely essential that we address these objectives.
      </para>
      <para>
       In turning to an extension of that idea, I find the same degree of short-sightedness in the United States. The year 1987 was described by one leading solar researcher as a black year. The activities of the Solar Energy Research Institute of Western Australia were greatly reduced; they have since been closed down. The Solar Energy Research Centre of the University of Queensland was totally disbanded. So not only is the Federal Government not spending money in this area, but also it is sending a clear signal to the United States that it is not appropriate that it spend money either. Yet this is the very area in which in a few short years into the future it will be absolutely necessary that we have the technology to provide the energy which is the very basis of all our industrial processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       To turn to another area where I believe we are on the threshold of making a great mistake, the world has now recognised that we must move away from the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration and in a number of other areas for which those gases are used. The high technology approach is to attempt to slot into refrigerators an alternative which has been developed by ICI Australia Ltd and DuPont going by the name of 134a. It is a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) and it does not have the serious ozone depleting characteristics of CFC-12, the commonly used refrigerant. However, it has approximately 10 per cent of the greenhouse effect of CFC-12. It does not require a great deal of imagination to understand that if refrigeration, even using the new 134a refrigerant, comes into widespread use in a country such as China with 60 times our population and the same sorts of technology are used-namely, one in which as the unit requires maintenance the gas is simply bled off to atmosphere-irrespective of what we do about carbon dioxide, the addition of HFC-134a to the atmosphere will far exceed that reduction in CO2 in its effect on greenhouse. Our children and our children's children will be in a worse situation than they are today.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have in our midst a low technology-I stress that-refrigeration using ammonia. It happens to be five times more energy efficient to use ammonia than it is to use CFC. It is used in all our gas fridges and all our kerosene refrigerators. Looking 10 to 15 years into the future, I believe that we should be making an intelligent decision to go back to the old technology which has been around for well over 100 years now and to develop that as a major technology for use both within Australia and for export purposes. I believe that as the world wakes up to what it is doing going down the alternative `high technology' road using the new chemical, it will discover it is going down a blind alley and cannot use that technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are a lot of other technologies, some of them old technologies, which are more appropriate to where we need to go. The point I am trying to stress is that we are lacking the wisdom to see where we need to position this country and, indeed, act as a leader to the rest of the world in developing those technologies which are appropriate to meet the environmental constraints which some of us see looming so large before us.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government pays lip-service to those matters; indeed, it has appointed a number of people within its various departments to advise it on greenhouse. My experience of those people is that they have been put there deliberately to obfuscate the issue and to attempt to put off as long as possible the need to address this urgent problem. My criticism of this Bill and many other Bills like it is simply that lack of wisdom, that lack of ability to see that there is a cohesive, coordinating imperative developing in the environment which must direct the way in which we develop our technology over the next 10 to 15 years to meet those challenges so that we do not leave behind us a legacy of a world which is degraded, in which the options for our children and grandchildren are so much depleted; indeed, in which the options may be so depleted that they find it difficult to survive at all.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us get away from the buzz words of high technology and micro-economic reform and let us talk about the real constraints within which Australian industry must be developed. While I believe we should be doing this for reasons of sanity, for reasons of responsibility to later generations, if we go down that road it will also produce the sorts of industries which will position us in a very good way to meet the challenges of other countries and, therefore, to address the very serious problems which we face in terms of our balance of trade and our own industry vis-a-vis industries in other countries.

        —My contribution to the debate will be somewhat brief. However, I would like to pick up the theme established by Senator Bishop. While not opposing the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, I believe that it is worth taking stock at this point of where we are at in Australia economically, in the climate in which the business community has to exist.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is worth putting on the record that we are constantly presented with legislation which is necessary, not for the advancement of Australia's industry in international markets but actually to hide damage already being done to that sector by the policies of the Hawke Government. Today we have seen yet another example of how those policy settings are wrong for the business community and job opportunities for Australians.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the main objectives of the legislation we are discussing tonight is to extend the grants for industry research and development (GIRD) scheme to 30 June 1994. The GIRD scheme has operated since 1986. As we know, it provides assistance to companies and research agencies to develop technologies with commercial application in Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the financial year 1989-90 its two components in total approved some 90 applications at a cost of $37.6m. No-one on this side of the chamber doubts the necessity in the current economic climate for supporting the extension of this scheme. However, the examination of why such schemes are actually necessary is quite a different matter. They are unfortunately necessary because this Government, while making bellicose statements about achieving the clever country and paying lip-service to how crucial industry innovation is for Australia's future, has, at the same time, set in place policies which can only cripple it and it becomes a vicious circle. The policies are wrong.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Hawke-Keating economic inefficiencies are not being addressed by appropriate government action because no-one but John Button will admit there are inadequacies. So bandaid government schemes, such as GIRD, are created to camouflage the damage. But camouflage or not, the facts remain glaringly obvious. And they are not facts of which the Government can be proud.
      </para>
      <para>
       While GIRD certainly encourages some firms, which could not otherwise afford to invest in research and development, business sector spending in that area as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) still leaves Australia at an extremely low level. Our business sector spends just 0.52 per cent of GDP on research and development. When compared with, for example, Germany's business sector at 2.08 per cent, it is not a healthy sign. I doubt anyone can take comfort in the fact that if one searches through the statistics long enough one can find a country whose business sector spends less than ours, such as Spain at 0.42 per cent of GDP. Meanwhile Australian government sector spending on research and development as a percentage of GDP remains higher than other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries at 0.39 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       We obviously have a long way to go in getting a better balance between government and business spending on research and development. It is quite clear that the balance cannot be achieved under the present economic policies of this Government. These policies have militated against the raising of venture capital to underwrite industry related technology innovation. As well, the crippling interest rates and labour costs, the taxation burden, the waterfront inefficiencies and the loss of consumer confidence do nothing to either allow or encourage business to invest in research and development.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Bishop referred to one South Australian company in the high-tech research and development innovation area and the difficulties it is facing. Whilst not naming it, I would like to mention another South Australian based company. A very successful family company, it has been in operation for 80 years and has plants overseas based in the United Kingdom, Germany and China as well in South Australia. It employs several thousand employees within Australia alone.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the first time in its 80-year history that company most probably will not be making a profit this year. That company has reduced staffing levels across the board from management down to the shop floor. It is now looking at the last area of curtailing expenditure-its research and development area-and cutting that out. It is a company that relies heavily on research and development to upgrade its market opportunities, to upgrade its product lines and to keep pace with and in front of the rest of the world in terms of the product that it manufactures and exports for Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       That company is no different from many other companies, small or big, throughout Australia which, because of a range of economic policies and pressures that have been applied to them, have simply cut out those functions that are not absolutely essential to survival today. It is sad that research and development is one of the areas that gets crossed off and dismantled. It has long term repercussions not only for the companies concerned but also for job opportunities and for Australia in the long term.
      </para>
      <para>
       The recession that this Government tells us we had to have will further markedly reduce business investment in this area. Ideally, industry related technology innovation programs should be the responsibility of the private sector. It is, therefore, uncomfortable to know that the economic circumstances of 1991 mean that as a Liberal I have to support legislation which is, in effect, an industry prop.

The fact is that a whole range of economic circumstances are now compounding the problem, making it absolutely essential for these types of policy directions to be in place, to give some assistance and to stop the drain away from a vital and important area in research and development. A country governed properly has industry which does not need props to keep it moving in a direction which is in its own long term interest, unhindered by poor economic management from Canberra.

       We need to get the mix of research and development between the government sector and the private sector a little better balanced so that we start equating with countries like Germany, which has a greater percentage of its GDP committed by the private sector to research and development. That is what I am talking about.

       During the last session I spoke out strongly against changes to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill which watered down government help to the nation's small business exporters. That is in contradiction to the interjection that the Minister made in this debate. On the one hand, in that particular area the Government is watering down assistance to small business enterprises, to open up and maintain export markets overseas. That puts the lie to the comment that the Minister made earlier during my remarks.

        —No, it does not. The reason it does not is that those small businesses, because of the circumstances applying now, simply cannot tap into and maintain those export markets. We have a balance of payments problem in this country-or had the Minister not noticed? We need to get the economic settings right so that we can start systematically removing some of the props costing taxpayers in this country, by giving positive and active encouragement to business to commit its own funds to research and development, as it ought to be, as it does in many other countries throughout the world.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the instance that I have just referred to, the Government removed some of the aid and, as a result, many small firms have walked away from the export market because in the current climate they simply cannot meet the withdrawal of that aid and support. That is why we are supporting these measures before the chamber tonight. We are supporting these measures because they are clearly an indication of this Government's failing in economic policy settings, and the difficulties that are being experienced by business throughout this country as a result.
      </para>
      <para>
       While we agree that the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 should not be opposed, our reasons for that decision are not in line with the Government's views. I hope that the need for the GIRD scheme will be as short as the life of this Government. The only way that we will set about creating a climate in the long term for those business opportunities, for research and development, and the appropriate committal of private sector funds to research and development, is to ensure that overall economic policy settings in this country are right.

        —I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. The Opposition, of course, never lets the facts stand in the way of a good story and it has not done so on this occasion.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I would like to point out briefly that the picture has been painted this evening of Australia being in a regressive state as a result of this Government's policies in respect of research and development from the private sector. I would like to put the facts on the record. The level of Australian business investment in research and development has in fact risen from 0.24 per cent of gross domestic product in 1981-82 to 0.52 per cent of GDP in 1988-89. That is in real terms almost the highest growth rate of private investment in research and development in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is encouraging in terms of business research and development. That is a major determinant of the innovative capacity of private business. But it is paralleled by an even more impressive figure, and that is the extent of Australian companies seeking patents overseas. In 1978 there was an annual rate of 2,400 applications, which had risen in 1988 to 14,400. That is almost a six-fold increase in the number of Australian companies that are not only innovative but also actively seeking to patent their wares elsewhere overseas.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I want to speak very strongly against acceptance of the Opposition's amendment. It is in fact a political statement, and Senator Bishop and Senator Olsen had the opportunity to do that in debate anyway. The opening paragraph, paragraph (a), should be defeated because it is a fact that governments of all political persuasions have supported research and development directly with grants such as those provided under this scheme for a quarter of a century. So they should, and so we should continue to do. It is not an indication of the Government's failure to provide a perfect world where private enterprise will do this without any assistance at all. In this country, with our large continent and our small population by international standards, it is essential for government to play a role in this area. I hope that on those grounds the amendment will be defeated.
      </para>
      <para>
       In terms of the sparkling performance of the Opposition in providing real solutions rather than political rhetoric, none could be better demonstrated than in the matter that has been raised by Senator Bishop, and that is reform of the waterfront. We now have-and I have been waiting for it for a year-the first detailed statement by a shadow Minister from the Opposition as to what the Opposition's policy is. At an industry function a week ago, a speaker said to the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, `You have been criticising the Government for 12 months'--

         —Senator Collins, I am right in what I am saying. On 12 February 1991 at page 339 of Hansard I was talking about the Australian Wheat Board's annual report of 1989-90. Unfortunately, a few of my statements were put wrong by Hansard. Not that I blame it; it was a case of using terms. I will go through and read into the Hansard the correct version. I have been in contact with Hansard today and it may be too late to change it. As I said, I was talking about the Australian Wheat Board annual report for 1989-90. In the first paragraph I mentioned that we had had a change in the Wheat Marketing Act. I said that the basis of that Act was the deregulation of the domestic market and the removal of the GMP; in other words, the guaranteed minimum price. If I can use my phonetics, it should be Golf Mike Papa. Unfortunately, the Hansard read--

I can also assure it that I still believe what I said about it giving up that guaranteed minimum price without a fight, which we have paid for now.

         —Tonight I take the opportunity to mention a matter which is of very great importance to Australia. It relates to waterfront reform. I am pleased that Minister Collins is in the chamber while I say this. Commissioner Sweeney in the Industrial Relations Commission today issued a statement on six matters still outstanding relating to Conaust (Aust) Pty Ltd and Container Terminals of Australia Ltd (CTAL) in their attempts to reform the waterfront. The six matters still outstanding were really some of the most crucial ones of dispute between the parties. They were matters which needed to be resolved if there is to be any real chance of waterfront reform in Australia. They related to overtime, double headers, recruitment, the practice known as two-up and two-down, amenities men and preference in employment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Following the statement Conaust and CTAL announced publicly at the time that whilst they had reservations they did accept the statement of the Commission. Whilst it is not everything they wanted, they were, in an attempt to get the reform process going, prepared to state publicly, because of the public interest involved in this, that they would accept those things subject to some conditions. The conditions were that all other matters understood to have been previously agreed were to remain as agreed and, in particular, the number of permanent employees of CTAL should be the number indicated to the Commission during the most recent talks and around which this particular package was designed. The other condition was that a strict timetable for processing the outcome to actual implementation of reforms be announced and stuck by.
       </para>
       <para>
        It now awaits the union organisation to determine its attitude towards this particular issue. Conaust and CTAL deserve the very great thanks of this nation. They have our congratulations and should have the nation's congratulations for the part that they have played in this. They have not been bullied into accepting a second rate agreement. They have not caved in where others have. In doing so, they have done Australia a great service,. The agreement that has resolved following today's issues is good and as good as one might hope to get in this instance. It has much better qualities than many other agreements that have been spoken about and accepted by competitors of Conaust and CTAL, to the extent that these people who held out for the right agreement will now be much more competitive. It also makes a mockery of the statements of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) that the right agreements had been achieved in other issues. I am more familiar with the Cairns port, but in the agreement with National Terminals Australia Ltd--

It is no wonder that he had to get the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other senior Ministers to come along and help him with it. I am pleased to say that as a result of the people standing out and as a result of the Opposition's pressure-and Mr John Sharp has done a marvellous job on this-the pressure has been kept up and the industry moving. If it had not been for people such as John Sharp and the Opposition generally, Senator Parer and other people, agreements would have been made months ago which did not carry out the necessary reform.

        One might be a little suspicious of this happening. It was because the Prime Minister wanted to announce something in his economic statement. He had nothing of any interest and of any real reform to announce.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that we should be thankful for small mercies and it is probably good that the economic statement is to be made. At least we will get some reform. I might also add that this matter is not resolved at the moment. The people on one side have indicated that, with some reservations, they would accept. They announced that publicly and quickly so that the process could go ahead. We await the union's response.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suspect that the Government and the Minister are pleased that the matter is almost resolved. But I am sure that tonight they will be the subject of many calls from their mates in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia who are trying to stop this sort of thing. Some of the reforms that may well have been implemented through the courage of Conaust and CTAL would overcome some of the rotten practices that have grown up in the waterfront over many years.

As Senator Walters said a few days ago, `There are only a certain number of sleeps before Senator Collins is back on the back bench where he was until the Prime Minister, for some reason, promoted him to the front bench some time ago'. It is good that we have had this statement. It is up to the unions to decide what they will do and hopefully, for the benefit of Australia, the unions will come along with the right decisions.

       <para>
        It is probably appropriate that I just briefly mention the six matters that were dealt with and that have been determined, spoken on, resolved or supported today by Commissioner Sweeney. Probably the most important matter is the question of recruitment. It may seem strange to other employers in Australia, and it may seem strange to me as a small businessman, that where I could employ the people I wanted to employ, that has never been possible in a union industry. The union used to employ the labour for the employer. The employer had no say in who was employed. The union chose the employees. I am very pleased to say that that practice has now ceased in this particular instance. Hopefully, this will be a precedent for all others in the stevedoring and waterfront industries. That was one of the major problems. It is a significant breakthrough that that particular issue appears to be overcome in this instance and hopefully this will allow others to follow this course.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the issue of preference of union labour, the Commissioner has stated that that should be left as an award issue to be dealt with later. Another matter dealt with was the question of overtime. In the past, employees could not work for the very small period that may have been needed to finish unloading or loading a ship. They had to be paid for the whole shift. As a result of this agreement today-or what I hope will be an agreement-that practice has now been reformed and the overtime can now be extended by 2 1/2 hours without the whole shift having to be paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of double headers, which I have mentioned, was also dealt with. A double header is where an employee working day shifts, works as overtime the immediately following shift. There was a proposal to take a lesser rate of pay where that happened more than a number of times in a week and to take time off in lieu. That has not been fully resolved but the employers are prepared to accept it. Another issue is referred to as two-up two-down. The Minister will no doubt give us the benefit--

Then the third period of 2.2 hours is free from driving. The union will only allow men to drive on the first and third periods whereas the employers wanted them to be able to drive on the first and second periods.

It had nothing to do with Waterside Workers Federation members and should have been done by other unionists, but it was done by the WWF. The Commissioner today has agreed that it should remain a WWF issue, but has commented, of course, that the work practices, which were the real concern of the employers, are another thing and that maybe they should be looked at: the number of people doing these jobs, the way they were doing them, and the management practices. It has been suggested that the WWF be allowed to remain there and, whilst not particularly happy with that, the employers in this instance have said that they will go along with it.

        There is a brief explanation of the issues that were involved-six very major and important issues. Hopefully, if the union will do the right thing, it will acknowledge them tomorrow and that particular matter will be off the table for some time and will provide a precedent for future reform on the waterfront and in other parts of Australia. I know that there have been other places where these things were sought but were not agreed upon. I mention again Cairns, with which I am more familiar and in respect of which the Minister had the hide to stand up and say that it was beautifully done. Like one of his colleagues, I guess, he probably used such terms as `beautiful agreements' or `beautiful numbers', with just as little knowledge or understanding of what it is about.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fortunately, this breakthrough has been made. Hopefully, the stevedores in Cairns, Townsville and Mackay will be able to look at the question again. Most importantly, wherever we go the stevedores will tell us that being able to select their own employees was paramount. It is a breakthrough. I only hope that the unions will respond accordingly and maybe-just maybe-the waterfront will be a little reformed. I again congratulate Mr Sharp, the Opposition, and those companies who held out, who would not succumb to the soft agreements, and who would not be bullied and pressured by those who have brought these corrupt practices. They deserve the nation's thanks and I certainly express that on behalf of the people that I am aware of in the industry, the people of Australia, who will benefit so much from it.

         —I welcome that interjection, because they made the most comprehensive statement about it a week ago from one of their shadow Ministers on the front bench. Mr McLachlan, the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, attended an industry function last week. He was confronted with a member of the industry-no friend of the Government-who jumped up and said, `You are the speaker here today on behalf of the Opposition. You have been criticising the Government for 12 months on its waterfront reform program. We are yet to hear one single piece of information from the Opposition about how you would do it instead'. That is true. Apart from the absolutely meaningless political rhetoric such as `taking the gloves off' and `getting tough with the unions' which we heard tonight, we have heard in 12 months not one single piece of policy information delivered by those opposite about how they would reform the Australian waterfront. I have been waiting for a debate in the Senate on the issue for 12 months-in vain. It has never been run by the Opposition. I am still waiting for the first waterfront debate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Those opposite run repetitive matters of public importance. We had today the fourth matter of public importance in a row on the same issue-but not a debate on the waterfront. Why? Because they have nothing to say. The shadow Minister, Mr McLachlan, in response to an industry request for some information, said, `We are not going to tell you what our policy is on reforming the waterfront because we do not want Bill Kelty to know'. That was carried, I am not surprised, prominently on page two of the Australian newspaper. I must say that I am amazed that any member of the Opposition would have the hide to stand up in Parliament and even talk about waterfront reform when the shadow Minister responsible for industry and commerce says that at an industry function to an industry inquiry. It went down with the industry like a lead balloon. I heard about it long before I read about it in the Australian newspaper.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr McLachlan went on to say, `Well, we have got nothing to tell you about waterfront reform. We haven't got a policy on waterfront reform. We won't tell you because we don't want Bill Kelty to find out'. Now, there is a sophisticated approach to getting reform in industry. He went further and said, `Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, but there are a couple of senior people in this room who know what we will do before the next election'. Honourable senators opposite call that a policy!
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Macdonald said, `Conaust has not been bullied into accepting a second class agreement'. Indeed, it has not. The bullies were all on the other side. It was the bullies who wanted the second-class approach adopted by abandoning the agreement process, the one they wanted to fail because they do not believe in consensus. They do not believe in getting agreement from unions. They want to be hairy chested without specifying how. That is how they are going to do it. They do not believe in a consensus approach at all. They were quite happy to say six months ago, `Let's abandon ship. Let's go for a national brawl on the waterfront'. That is what they wanted. That is what they said. They said, `Let us take on the unions. Let us have an industrial brawl we don't need or we can't afford just for the sake of getting tough with the unions. We don't want a negotiated approach'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was because we did not give in to the bullies on the other side in pursuing the agreement approach which has in fact resulted in the decision today. Might I say that it would have been very easy, as a member of parliament of some 15 years standing now, to have become an instant, overnight hero- of course, it would have hurt the country-by saying, `Let's get tough with the unions. Let's take the gloves off and get stuck into the unions'.
       </para>
       <para>
        What did Senator Macdonald do in respect of the balanced approach taken by the Opposition? I can assure Senator Macdonald that he has delivered a very quotable speech here tonight. He singled out the employing company, Conaust Pty Ltd, for praise and then attacked the union. He said that it was Conaust that had done it, as distinct from National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, which had a second-class agreement. Senator Macdonald would not know the difference between those two operations. He would be as ignorant about that as he is about what two-up two-down is. That is in fact the major issue that has been resolved this afternoon in the Commission.

        Senator Macdonald talked at length about National Terminals. I will tell Senator Macdonald why the National Terminals agreement was negotiated before the Conaust agreement. It is very simple. I ask Senator Macdonald whether he is listening. He will not know, but it is about time he did. The National Terminals company has two major terminal operations in Sydney and Melbourne. That is it. On the other hand, Conaust operates not only terminal facilities in Sydney and Melbourne but also a string of conventional stevedoring operations right around the country, including my home port of Darwin. It is in fact, although Senator Macdonald would not know it, the largest employer of waterfront labour in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite simply the reason the National Terminals agreement, which is an excellent agreement that is going to result in excess of 60 per cent productivity increases in that company, was negotiated before the Conaust agreement was that the operations of the two companies are totally and utterly different. National Terminals does not operate conventional stevedoring operations such as Conaust does around the country. That is why the issues were so difficult to resolve.
       </para>
       <para>
        Twelve of the outstanding issues between the union and the company were resolved in the first few weeks of the negotiation. A further 20 were resolved in the past six months by agreement between the union and the company. Senator Macdonald singles out the employer and says that it is due to it and John Sharp, who has contributed not one jot-I ask him to look at the public record-to this process in the past 12 months and he then condemns the union. Of course, this is the night before the union is due to appear before the Commission again to indicate its position on the matter.

The Opposition did not want this process to succeed. If we have ever seen a politician on the defensive, it has been Senator Macdonald tonight. As I have said before, National Terminals is going to achieve those significant productivity improvements and also is currently engaged in a $60m upgrading program of its facilities in the port of Sydney which will make it, in fact, one of the most modern facilities in the world because of the success of the reform program and agreement it has got. It would never have spent a dollar otherwise.

         —The Senate record will stand. Everybody will read the Hansard. The fact is that the issue simply involved half an hour. The reason it was before the Commission is that the union has just agreed to renegotiate the rosters at the Container Terminals of Australia Ltd (CTAL) terminal in Sydney, an extremely important matter not just for the employers-I point this out to Senator Macdonald, although he does not care-but also for the employees as well whose entire lives, their family life, sporting life and everything else, revolves around the rosters they work. It all revolved around an agreement by their unions to change the rosters at CTAL to reduce them to a 7 1/2-hour roster. The argument was then that the existing extension, which has always existed in the industry-it did not just come up today-should remain at the original 2 hours or should be extended to 2 1/2 hours so that the original time period of standard shift plus overtime remained at the 10 hours it was previously. That was the issue, not the piece of nonsense Senator Macdonald delivered in the Senate tonight. In fact, in terms of Commissioner Sweeney's recommendation this afternoon it was decided that that should be the case.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The parties now have to consider how this agreement will be implemented. What Conaust has done in the Commission is not simply accept the recommendations of the Commission unequivocally and unilaterally, as Senator Macdonald has said. In fact, Captain Setchell of Conaust has indicated to the Commission a set of conditions. These are not the Commission's conditions, but conditions that Conaust has now placed on that acceptance and which the unions now have to consider. That would be lost on Senator Macdonald. Senator Macdonald wants to know why, when Conaust stood up in the Commission this afternoon and indicated acceptance, the unions could not immediately indicate acceptance too. The reason for this can be found in the transcript of the Commission hearing. When Conaust stated that the recommendations were acceptable to it, it said that they were acceptable `on the condition that' and retailed them. Senator Macdonald has told us only about some of them this evening. Conaust then detailed a list of conditions. These were not Commission conditions, but company conditions which Conaust wished to have implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        The union was hearing these conditions for the first time. Naturally, it now has to consider whether the conditions, as well as the recommendations of the Commissioner, are acceptable to it. It will appear in the Commission at 9 a.m. tomorrow. What the Opposition is running scared about now-and it is painfully obvious-is that this process may actually succeed. It is a frightening prospect for an Opposition politician. I know how it feels. I have been there myself for 10 years. I recognise an Opposition politician on the run because I have been one myself on past occasions. In conclusion, the Government also endorses the recommendation of Commissioner Sweeney.

When I return to my office I will have faxed to me from the Commission what the conditions are. I have not had an opportunity to read them yet because I have been in here-or have Opposition senators not noticed? The Government endorses Commissioner Sweeney's recommendations. We think they are sensible; we think they are equitable. As Captain Richard Setchell of Conaust said today, they are recommendations that will lead to very real reform and productivity increases on the Australian waterfront.

       <para>
        I have seen the Commission's recommendations, which have arrived-Captain Setchell's have not yet; they are being faxed to me by Captain Setchell now. What I do have is the Commission's transcript, and in respect of that transcript I unequivocally endorse the recommendations of Commissioner Sweeney. I would urge all of the parties-the unions and the employers-to act immediately on those recommendations and move to the conclusion of the negotiation of an enterprise agreement. That agreement, for Senator Macdonald's information, will not result simply in the CTAL agreement in Sydney being consummated-that is the reason this has been a long, drawn out process-but in a whole string of other enterprise agreements, I am sorry to tell the honourable senator, which are being negotiated in Conaust's operations right around the coast of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to conclude on one matter which again has escaped Senator Macdonald. Once again, he has bucketed the unions tonight. He has singled out Conaust and said how wonderful it is and it is all its achievement-something which not even Captain Richard Setchell, who runs the company, would ever say-and what a terrific achievement it is. I will tell honourable senators something about the union reality. It may well be that the working conditions that have been implemented on the Australian waterfront, and not touched by any government for the last 50 years until now, have been unproductive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have a copy of an interview where Captain Setchell on national television six months ago conceded publicly that the management and companies were just as much at fault as the unions in allowing these conditions to be developed. If Senator Macdonald would like a copy, I will send it to him. But in every respect, leaving aside whether the issues concerned in the work practices are good or bad, the process required of the unions has been on every occasion to negotiate giving up a condition which they have had for nearly half a century. Whether we are talking about amenities men, two-up two-down, double headers, overtime or any of the other 32 clauses that have already been negotiated by agreement prior to the Commission being involved, it has involved the union making concessions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no difficulty in saying that in respect of the consummation of the national terminals agreement last year there is no argument from me that these conditions had to be given up, but they did have to be given up by the union. The company was in the position of getting productivity gains. It was easy for the company in a real life industrial situation to make ground because it was gaining, but in every case it required the unions to give up--

I am absolutely confident that it will be because of that same commitment, publicly expressed many times by the union leadership, to get reform on the waterfront for the sake of this country and indeed for the industry and its members that the Conaust agreement will also-much to the chagrin and disgust of Senator Macdonald and his colleagues-be consummated by this process of agreement. When it is, the Government's targets set for both productivity and for redundancies will not only be met but substantially exceeded.

       (4) Following a decision by the Government to establish the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports (SIDCDE) the Committee met eight times in 1988, four times in 1989 and once to date in 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       Meetings have been primarily concerned with policy issues rather than consideration of export applications as the number of applications and the requirement to meet a 21 day deadline for approvals meant that relying on meetings to consider cases would not give exporters the prompt decisions they require. It was therefore agreed by departments that those cases the SIDCDE required to consider would be dealt with out of session on an individual basis. This usually involves facsimile transmission of application details and SIDCDE member responses.

       Further to this, formal and informal referral occurs, where it is felt that an application is likely to be of interest to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

       A quarterly summary of applications and approvals is provided to all SIDCDE members.

      <para>
       (13) Approvals-in-principle are considered carefully to save exporters marketing effort and expenses. Nevertheless, irrespective of the issue of an ``approval-in-principle'', a follow-up export application is treated as a separate application and is processed in accordance with policy guidelines. In particular the application would be referred to the SIDCDE if it met the criteria for referral. This is important because of the possibilities of changed circumstances after issue of an ``approval-in principle''. Apart from such changes in circumstances relating to an application, exporters could expect SIDCDE decisions on permits to be consistent with decisions on ``applications in principle''.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) No
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) No

      <para>
       (14) (a) No, except in broad terms of the guidelines agreed by Ministers as indicated in answer to (11).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Yes. The potential exporter would generate a request for ``approval-in-principle'' in the early stages of marketing. The criteria applied are the same as for considering an application for an export permit as indicated in answer to (11). Depending on the type of equipment and destination the application would be subject to normal SIDCDE consultation. The ``approval-in-principle'' would be given by the Minister for Defence or the delegate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (15) No ``approval-in-principle'' was sought or given prior to the HdeH application for a permit to export trainer aircraft engine parts to Iraq. As the goods were covered by Part 1B in Schedule 13 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations and because of military advice that the parts were ``not of major military significance'', it was not required under Government policy to refer the application to the SIDCDE. However, in view of potential sensitivities the views of DFAT were sought prior to issue of the permit. DFAT had no objections to the export which was approved by the delegate on 28 May 1990 and revoked on 7 August 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
      </para>
      <para>
       (16) (a) On the basis of advice obtained from the Attorney-General's Department, I believe that the answers to the first part of the question are:

       (i) No

       However, my Department is seeking further advice in the light of a recent decision of the High Court in the case of Bropho vs the State of Western Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) If by ``procedures'' you mean the policy criteria specified in the ``Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods'' as applying to the consideration of an application then the answers to the question are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Yes

       (17) While this question does not apply in view of the response in 16(b) above, I advise that a direction has been given that the export of ex-ADF equipment for disposal action by the Commonwealth or exported as part of a Defence Co-operation Program, will be subject to the same guidelines and policies promulgated in the document ``Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods''.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Pak-Poy and Kneebone Pty Ltd with Henderson Consultants reviewed the Defence commercial vehicle fleets in 1988 with assistance from a Defence Review Team and presented the following reports:
      </para>
      <para>
       Consultancy Study-Army Commercial Vehicle Fleet Phase lB
      </para>
      <para>
       Consultancy Study-Review of Defence Commercial Vehicle Fleet Phase 2 (Navy, Air Force, remainder of Defence)
      </para>
      <para>
       Copies of these reports are available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The following recommendations agreed by the Services are being implemented:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Services should maintain the ownership of their CL vehicle fleets but in so doing should adopt new acquisition and disposal criteria which are no less advantageous than those pursued by DAS and commercial operators.
      </para>
      <para>
       Even though there would be a long term cost advantage from the Department owning its own fleet, at this stage it should continue to hire its CL vehicles from DAS where it does so at present (ownership would require Government approval for an exemption from current rules).
      </para>
      <para>
       A substantially self-funding arrangement should be adopted in which funds generated from the disposal of Service CL vehicles are preserved and applied directly to the procurement of replacement Service CL vehicles.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the present sales tax free environment, a basic replacement criteria of 2 years/40000 km should be adopted to maximise the sales tax advantages of selffunding.
      </para>
      <para>
       An automated fleet management information system (Fleet MIS) should be introduced by each Vehicle Controller within Defence to provide information to allow managers to make timely decisions and to enable their fleets, as a whole, to be operated in a cost-effective manner.
      </para>
      <para>
       The arrangements and organisational structures for the management of the various fleets should be simplified and the resources devoted to vehicle fleet management should be reduced.
      </para>
      <para>
       A standardised system of vehicle nomenclature and groupings should be adopted throughout Defence.
      </para>
      <para>
       VIP and ceremonial Service vehicles should continue to be purchased in Service colours. Other vehicles should be purchased in colours which maximise the returns from sale.
      </para>
      <para>
       Defence air-conditioning policies should be reviewed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Vehicles should be purchased with accessories, options and specifications which would optimise returns from sale.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whole of life costs should be considered during acquisition.
      </para>
      <para>
       Defence should establish and maintain appropriate channels of communication with DAS and pursue the scope for obtaining discounts in other than just the long haul area.
      </para>
      <para>
       The scope for increased use of civilian contractors for repair and maintenance should be examined.
      </para>
      <para>
       A series of initiatives should be taken to develop and introduce disposal arrangements which would optimise returns from the sale of Defence owned vehicles.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In the early stages, some resistance was experienced but, as staff have become better informed and more aware of the benefits of improved fleet management practices, this resistance is no longer evident and indeed has been replaced by support.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Services are aware, at the macro level, of the personnel costs involved in operating commercial vehicle fleets. There is not the same awareness at the micro levels where the actual vehicles are managed. There are currently no regular reports of these particular personnel costs made to senior management. However the Commercial Vehicle Management Program initiatives now being introduced will improve visibility of these costs at all levels of management.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) As with personnel costs, vehicle operating and maintenance costs are available at a macro level. Current management information systems do not readily provide detailed information on operating costs for commercial vehicles. The introduction of a new Fleet Management Information System in early 1991 will provide the means for the Services to capture, analyse and report this information down to the level of individual vehicles if required.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The management of the Services commercial vehicle fleets is not contracted out. The consultants recommended that the management of commercial vehicles remain within Defence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The estimated cost to bring the Services' commercial vehicle fleets up to an efficient standard was an additional $36m over two years. Substantial savings would then accrue. These funds are not available and a longer term funding option is being undertaken with additional funds being provided to the Services for implementation of the initiatives.

      <para>
       (1) The proportion of the Australian Regular Army (ARA) in each category is:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) 28.43% or 8 165 ARA

       (c) 55.44% or 15 923 ARA.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Due to the categorisation of units within the Army Order of Battle it is not possible to identify a breakdown of figures into purely ARA and Army Reserve (ARes) when considering the Army's WEM. WEM is an indicative figure only, and as such provides a target to which Army would aim in time of expansion to meet a defence emergency. The method by which the Army might achieve such an expansion may see ARes personnel being posted into ARA units to `round-out' these units to WEM. Therefore the figure given for WEM in Table D is the total manpower requirement for each component in time of defence emergency and cannot be broken down further. Given this explanation the following table provides a breakdown of figures into ARA and ARes for Authorised Manpower and Actual Manning (as at 30 June 1990) only.

       (2) Total for these two columns is 30 538 however Table D total was 30 973, a difference of 435.

      <para>
       (1) It is relevant to refer to procedures agreed with the Italian Government concerning the exemption from Italian tax provided by the double taxation convention for pensions paid from Italy to residents of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       These procedures require a pension recipient to lodge a form with the pension payer in order to stop Italian tax being withheld and to obtain a refund of any such tax withheld. Those forms, which are available from Italian consulates in Australia, require an endorsement from the Australian Taxation Office that the pensioner is a resident of Australia and is therefore entitled to the Italian tax exemption accorded by the convention. These procedures were the subject of a press release issued on 15 April 1988 by the Commissioner of Taxation after consultation with the Italian Embassy.
      </para>
      <para>
       They were also referred to in a comprehensive Ruling issued on 10 August 1989 by the Commissioner to clarify a number of issues regarding the tax treatment of Italian pensions. Both the press release and the Ruling were widely reported in the Italian press in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government understands that these procedures are operating satisfactorily to avoid recipients of Italian pensions residing in Australia being taxed twice.

      <para>
       In answering these questions the term ``research'' has been restricted to research activities related to social policy subjects. There are many other activities undertaken within the Department which could be classified as research e.g.: tender assessments, organisational planning and examination of options to improve ADP operations, office layout and design, forms design, etc. These are closely integrated with ongoing administrative responsibilities and, in terms of the information sought in the question, it is mostly not meaningful or feasible to separate out the research component. However, information on a number of aspects of activity which could be considered to fall within a wider concept of ``research'' has been provided to the Parliament at earlier times, e.g.:
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Social policy research is the responsibility primarily of the Social Policy Division of the Department. Staffing resources associated with this responsibility are not separately identifiable as much research activity is integrated with other policy development, policy review and statistical responsibilities of the Division.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 12 December 1990, the number of officers employed in that Division were:

      </para>
      <para>
       Research activities undertaken in the Division are not accounted for separately from its other activities and range well beyond the items noted along with research associated with policy development, policy review and statistical activities. As a whole the Social Policy Division used an average operative staffing level of 73.3 and spent $2,746,678 on salaries and $937,258 on administrative costs in 1989-90.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Department commissioned three research projects from academic institutions in 1989-90. All three were undertaken by the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. They were:
      </para>
      <para>
       * a review of the available evidence on the costs of sole parenthood with particular reference to implications for the structure of social security payments for this group;
      </para>
      <para>
       * an analysis of the structure of work incentives for the unemployed, including factors relevant to exit from unemployment benefit; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * a feasibility study for a longitudinal survey of family living standards in order to produce a firm proposal for such a study in 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) (a) The three projects were commissioned under an agreement between the Commonwealth and the University of New South Wales. The agreement provides for the funding of the Social Policy Research Centre by the Commonwealth and specifies an amount which is to be used for projects commissioned by the Commonwealth. In 1989-90 this amount was $100,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Given the agreement, none of the projects was subject to competitive tendering processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The projects were conducted during the course of 1990. Reports presenting their results have not yet been received.

       (1) and (2) The Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme was introduced in 1977 in response to requests from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities for employment in development projects as an alternative to unemployment benefits (UB).

Eight communities have development plans or have reviews/economic studies underway.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the new administrative arrangements for CDEP, communities will have to provide a CDEP works program when making applications for CDEP grant funds. The works program will comprise a list of projects that the community sees as important to its social, cultural, recreational and economic development.
      </para>

       ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
      </para>
      <para>
       All CDEP grants are assessed by the Commission on the annual ``Grant Assessment Form'' which is completed by Regional Officers as part of the annual draft estimates documentation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to the annual grant assessment all CDEP projects are to be fully reviewed on a three year cycle commencing in 1991/92. It is envisaged that these reviews will be undertaken by officers from the Commission and the Departments of Employment, Education and Training and Social Security.
      </para>
      <para>
       NSW has reviewed three projects that commenced in 1988/89, namely: Toomelah; Glen Innes and Murrin Bridge. The findings of these reviews are being implemented.

       PRIORITY SETTING
      </para>
      <para>
       Under new administrative arrangements priorities for the allocation of CDEP Oncost and Support funds will be determined by Regional Managers in consultation with Regional Councils and CDEP communities and organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       INACCURATE PAYMENTS
      </para>
      <para>
       It is acknowledged that some communities do not always submit fortnightly variation schedules. However, while this can cause short term inaccuracies, community entitlements are adjusted when subsequent schedules are received.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission will be introducing administrative changes to the CDEP scheme to take effect from 1 April 1991. These changes have been designed to simplify the calculation of communities' entitlements and should reduce the possibility of inaccuracies. This streamlining will assist the monitoring process.
      </para>
      <para>
       MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING TRAINING
      </para>
      <para>
       The lack of qualified Aboriginal people has been a problem for DAA/ATSIC and communities alike. Training initiatives have been taken by DAA/ATSIC and the Department of Employment, Education and Training to address this issue.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a part of new administrative arrangements for CDEP, a Training Needs Schedule and a training program to meet these needs for each CDEP is required. Through programs administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (Training for Aboriginals Program) funding is available for communities to engage a consultant, where appropriate, to prepare training needs analyses and/or training schedules for project participants.
      </para>
      <para>
       ENTITLEMENTS, ALLOWANCES AND AWARD PAYMENTS
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the ANAO audits of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were conducted there has been a significant improvement in the take up rate of the Family Allowance Supplement by CDEP participants. The Department of Social Security is promoting this allowance through its Aboriginal Liaison Officers and Community Agents.
      </para>
      <para>
       While ATSIC encourages the payment of wages at award rates, the setting of tasks, and hours of each participant, is left to the discretion of community councils and organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Award coverage for CDEP communities is a complex issue as the nature of the work generally is only part-time. The Commission is currently in the process of contracting a consultant to undertake research into industrial relations issues associated with CDEPs including the question of award coverage.

      <para>
       Data on the number of persons registered as unemployed and seeking employment (Unemployed Awaiting Placement) at local CES office or other small area level are not released as these figures are neither an accurate measure of unemployment, nor a reliable indicator of changes in unemployment, for the following reasons:
      </para>
      <para>
       * coverage of job seekers can vary over time as a result of changes in labour market conditions, variations in administrative procedures and the effects of Government policy, especially the impact of changes in labour market programs;
      </para>
      <para>
       * some jobseekers remain registered with the CES although they have either independently found employment or left the labour force but have not notified the CES;
      </para>
      <para>
       * not all people seeking employment register with the CES for assistance; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * at the local level the inaccuracies and distortions in the data which often occur are especially significant, and there are concerns that these figures may have been given undue emphasis in the past in determining plans and resource allocations in local communities.

       (3) There are no outstanding matters in relation to acquittance of CDEP grants prior to 1989-90. Only one of the 34 participating communities, Aurukun, has satisfied full acquittal requirements in respect of the 1989/90 financial year. All of the participating Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT) communities are awaiting Audit Reports from the Queensland Auditor General. The audited financial statements of three of the remaining four non DOGIT CDEPs-Jumbun, Cooktown, Mapoon-have been received but are yet to be analysed. Laura's audited financial statements are expected in the near future.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No official reviews have revealed any discrepancies or inadequacies with regard to CDEP ``cash'' payments by participating communities or by ATSIC offices.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) While qualified Audit Reports have been received for the 1988/89 financial year, in respect of the communities shown below, the qualifications were not specifically in respect to CDEP operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Annual CDEP Reviews were conducted at most of the Queensland CDEPs during 1989/90, and generally these revealed adequate standards of financial procedures and management in respect to their CDEP operations. As part of the Review process any deficiencies were drawn to the Council's attention.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the absence of the State Auditor General's Reports for 1989/90 it is not possible to conclusively assess whether the deficiencies identified in previous Audits and through CDEP Annual Reviews have been satisfactorily addressed.

      <para>
       Community Development Plans for each Queensland CDEP have not yet been prepared. The exception is Woorabinda Council which has a ten year plan developed by McGowan's International. This plan is used as a basis for the ongoing development of the whole community including CDEP.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under new administrative arrangements for CDEP, communities will have to provide a CDEP works program when making applications for CDEP grant funds. The works program will comprise a list of projects that the community sees as important to its social, cultural, recreational and economic development.
      </para>
      <para>
       Communities are being encouraged to develop specific CDEP plans and/or community development plans. The CDEP works program would be an integral part of either of these plans.

       In addition to the annual grant assessment all CDEP projects are to be fully reviewed on a three year cycle commencing in 1991/92.

       It is acknowledged that some communities do not always submit fortnightly variation schedules. However, while this can cause short term inaccuracies, community entitlements are adjusted when subsequent schedules are received.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission will be introducing administrative changes to the CDEP scheme to take effect from 1 April 1991. These changes have been designed to simplify the calculation of communities' entitlements and should reduce the possibility of inaccuracies. This streamlining will assist the monitoring process.

      </para>
      <para>
       As a part of new administrative arrangements for CDEP, a Training Needs Schedule and a training program to meet these needs for each CDEP is required. Through programs administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (Training for Aboriginals Program) funding is available for communities to engage a consultant, where appropriate, to prepare training needs analyses and/or training schedules for project participants.

       Since the ANAO audits of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were conducted there has been a significant improvement in the take up rate of the Family Allowance Supplement by CDEP participants. The Department of Social Security is promoting this allowance through its Aboriginal Liaison Officers and Community Agents.
      </para>
      <para>
       While ATSIC encourages the payment of wages at award rates, the setting of hours to be worked is left to the discretion of community councils and organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Award coverage for CDEP communities is a complex issue as the nature of the work generally is only part-time. The Commission is currently in the process of contracting a consultant to undertake research into industrial relations issues associated with CDEPs including the question of award coverage.

       (4) and (5) A full review by the former Department of Aboriginal Affairs combined with the 1988/89 audit revealed serious management deficiencies. The audit statement to 30 June 1989 revealed the following issues:

      <para>
       - The Government has introduced a new national index of disadvantage for the allocation of 1991 Disadvantaged Schools Program funds, including the additional $9m made available in the 1990-91 Federal Budget. The index seeks to identify the most seriously socio-economic disadvantaged communities in Australia, and is based on 1986 Census data and an analysis of schools' catchment areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       - The new index adopts the following six variables with the weightings indicated:

       - The basic index would have resulted in reductions in funding to the government school sectors in Victoria and the Northern Territory, and to the non-government school sectors in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. However, the Government decided that no State-sector would receive less in 1991 under the new index than it had in 1990. As a result, allocations for the potential losers are being maintained at 1990 funding levels in real terms at a total cost of $1.6m. Their enrolment ceilings are also being maintained at 1990 levels.

      <para>
       (1) The Land Rover 110 vehicle was introduced into service with roll-over protection designed to protect occupants specifically against possible roll-over when the vehicle was negotiating difficult slopes at slow speed.
