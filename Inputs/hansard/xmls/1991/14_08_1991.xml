       Tobacco Advertising
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.

       The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country.

       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I am introducing this Bill to make the full disclosure of political donations a legal requirement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since their inception, the Australian Democrats have had a clear policy in support of full disclosure and we have pursued that commitment with vigour. We believe that a requirement of full disclosure is not only correct in principle, but that the electorate is both entitled to know the source of donations to political parties and wants to have that information available to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The whole question of election funding has become a matter of concern in a range of countries recently because of three basic reasons. First, a number of studies, especially in the U.S.A., have shown that special interest contributions to political campaigns do influence legislative behaviour and results. Secondly, the rapidly escalating costs of political advertising, particularly on the electronic media, have placed enormous and growing pressure on participants in elections to raise very large sums of money. And thirdly, a number of scandals in several countries has shown that legislation giving favours to particular groups or businesses or even individuals can be traced back to donations made during election campaigns. We are seeing evidence of this here in Australia in a range of Royal Commissions and both the Report of the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in Queensland and the ICAC in NSW have expressed concern about the dangers of political corruption associated with the existing system of election fund raising and advertising. The Joint Standing Committee Report ``Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune'' (1989) also focused on these concerns and the risks of distortion to our open democratic system. A specific recommendation of that Committee Report was that all political parties should be required to disclose all donations, gifts and income and that the Australian Electoral Commission should be given power to conduct spot audits of political parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        As honourable Senators are aware, the Australian Government introduced legislation earlier this year dealing with both disclosure and political advertising. The history of events since then is well-known, but it does bear repeating briefly. The Government's proposed total ban on electronic media advertising was rejected by the Democrats and the Opposition even before the Bill came into the Parliament. However, the Democrats have consistently put the view that the disclosure provisions of the Government's Bill should be toughened and supported. Further, the Democrats have argued consistently that political advertisements should be regulated. We have been particularly vigorous in pushing for ``truth in advertising'' amendments-a matter we have pursued in the Parliament for many years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regrettably, for many months, the Government adopted a position of ``no ban, no Bill''. We persisted in our attempts to get support for amendments to toughen disclosure and require truth in advertising. Because we remained firm in our intention to keep the disclosure and ``truth'' issues alive the Government finally backed down from its position of a total ban. The Democrats were pleased to see an acknowledgment at last that the issues of disclosure and advertising could be split. We announced immediately that we would move to refer the advertising section of the Bill, (in its new form of an election-only ban), our proposed regulatory amendments including truth, and the recommendations of the Electoral Matters Committee Report to a Senate Committee for enquiry and report. Most importantly, we made it clear that there was no reason why the Parliament could not deal with the disclosure section of the Bill and pass it immediately.
       </para>
       <para>
        That remains our view. All parties have stated a position of support for full disclosure. We could have had a law requiring disclosure of donations passed through the Parliament this week if the Government and the Opposition had stuck to their stated commitments on this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats move to split the Bill has been thwarted by the combined actions of the Coalition and Labor parties in referring the entire Bill to a Committee. The whole concept of parties funding sources becoming a matter of public knowledge is still in jeopardy as a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition parties maintained support for separating the issues of advertising and disclosure until the day before their about-face, and it seems they were never genuine in their moves to split the Bill. When a point was reached that the Bill could be split, the old parties combined so that the disclosure provisions could be quietly shelved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats will not stand by and let the issue lapse. Our unsuccessful attempt to save and pass the disclosure provisions this week is a matter of regret, but we will still persist,-as we have for many years,-in pushing for full information being available to the electorate about donations to political parties. This Bill embraces the disclosure provisions of the Government's Bill and includes our amendments to toughen those provisions. The objectives of the Bill's contents are to achieve full, contemporaneous disclosure of donations to political parties, and annual reporting of all their income and expenditure. We welcome constructive comments and any improvements to the Bill to ensure those objectives are met. Most importantly, the existence of this Bill will be a constant reminder to the other parties of their public commitments to disclosure provisions. The Democrats will continue to press for such provisions to become law at the earliest possible opportunity. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Ombudsman Act 1976 in order to broaden the power of the Commonwealth Ombudsman with respect to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Specifically, the Bill seeks to amend sub-paragraphs 1 (a) and (b) of section 5 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 which provide for the Ombudsman to investigate complaints relating to matters of administration by a department or prescribed authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will add sub-paragraph (c) to section 5, which will allow the Ombudsman to respond to, and investigate, complaints regarding programming decisions of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Amendment seeks to redress the present situation whereby complaints against the ABC are investigated by the ABC.
       </para>
       <para>
        In May this year, in a belated response to increasing criticism of ABC programming decisions, particularly with regard to its reporting of the Gulf war, the ABC's Managing Director announced the establishment of an ``Independent Complaints Review Panel''.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Managing Director, the panel was established to ``review written complaints of serious bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment arising from ABC broadcasts''.
       </para>
       <para>
        While recognising the considerable media experience of the members of the panel, it is important to also note that the final determination for action on complaints rests with the ABC's Managing Director.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite his assertions, the ``Independent Complaints Review Panel'' is not truly independent.
       </para>
       <para>
        By way of comparison, I draw your attention to the way in which complaints regarding other media organisations are handled. For example, public complaints against the print media can be addressed to the Press Council, while complaints against commercial television or radio can be made to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now to the privileged position of the ABC. There are no independent review or adjudication procedures to deal with complaints about the ABC's programming decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The responsibility for investigating such complaints should not be that of a panel hand-picked by ABC management. Rather, it should be the responsibility of the Ombudsman.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ombudsman provides a review mechanism which need not directly interfere with the ABC's independence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ombudsman would be a truly independent adjudicator who is both highly regarded and respected by the public.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, the Ombudsman is an established authority which does not require additional establishment costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Successive Ombudsmen are of the opinion that their act already gives them the power to investigate ABC programming decisions and they are willing to exercise that power.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ABC argues that the Ombudsman does not have the power to investigate its programming decisions-that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction relates to administrative decisions only.
       </para>
       <para>
        This argument denies the public an effective, independent review of their complaints against the ABC.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is time that the ABC, was made answerable for its questionable programming decisions-decisions which have resulted in an unacceptable decrease in the quality of its programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, the proposal contained in this Bill will-
       </para>
       <para>
        * maintain the ABC's independence,
       </para>
       <para>
        * subject it to a respected and publicly acceptable course or independent adjudication, and
       </para>
       <para>
        * do so in a cost effective manner.
       </para>
       <para>
        I encourage you to concur with the amendments proposed in this Bill and vote accordingly.

        The Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I think the main issue that came from the Senate Committee was one of representation on appeal boards-that was certainly the flavour of submissions-and the Committee agreed to that. That will not appear in terms of amendment to the legislation, but will be incorporated in the rules which will be put down immediately after royal assent. Of course, they are also subject to disallowance, but I understand that those organisations making submissions were quite happy with the way we are approaching that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additionally, we are proposing amendments to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill 1991 and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. These are of a very minor nature. In the case of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill, the amendments deal with membership of and transfer to the military superannuation scheme and either fill minor gaps or make more precise provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, the amendments fill a gap in the provision regarding membership by reservists serving in operational areas; second, they make more specific provision regarding elections that may be made by members in certain circumstances; and, third, they make corrections to the provision for the suspension and cancellation of pensions of DFRDB pensioners who re-enter and elect to join the MSBS.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill-I mention this now because the two things are related-the amendments clarify two matters dealt with in the Bill and otherwise correct references. First, the amendments make more specific provision regarding election of members of the DFRDB scheme who retire, re-enter and again retire. Second, they clarify the class of invalidity retirees to whom proposed amendments of section 57 of the DFRDB Act are to apply. I commend the amendments to the Committee, and I present the supplementary explanatory memoranda to these amendments.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I wish to make a few comments on these amendments as they relate to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill and the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. As I said when I spoke in the second reading debate, this is an extremely complex pair of Bills, dealing with the superannuation scheme. It is not easy for members of parliament or, indeed, special interest groups to get a grip on the details that are affected by the drafting.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To give the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) his due, he was very helpful in providing to the Opposition the opportunity to take advice from superannuation experts on this Bill, and I do not think that I have acknowledged that publicly. I do appreciate the courtesy that was shown by him. Nevertheless, he did not take the well-meaning advice I offered him by way of correspondence earlier this year that this was a very appropriate Bill which should have been introduced and then left to lie on the table for some months so that all those who were interested in the matter could scrutinise it very carefully.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition did its best to scrutinise the legislation, as did the special interest groups. But exactly as I feared and predicted to the Minister, drafting problems have been found here and there, which are now being addressed by these Government introduced amendments. It is perhaps ironic that the Government is having to come and say, `We did not get it all right the first time'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do believe that this is not at all likely to be the last occasion on which amendments to this legislation will be introduced to remedy defects. As I said, it is almost impossible to get a Bill of such complexity all right the first time. That could have been avoided if we all had longer to study the legislation. Nevertheless, I do not wish to be mean-spirited; I simply wish to put that on the record and to say that I am informed that the Government has consulted widely with interest groups on these amendments, and for that I commend it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Enabling interest groups to see the fine print of what the Government is proposing is a very positive step which is not followed often enough. It is one thing to hear or to read what the Government intends; it is another thing altogether to see what it has actually achieved by way of legislation. Those two things do not always coincide, as we all know. So the interest groups have had an opportunity to be briefed by the officers and have expressed themselves as satisfied with the amendments; the Opposition has had an opportunity to do the same, and it is of the same view.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not wish to delay the Committee any further. I simply am prepared, on behalf of the Opposition, to accept the amendments produced by the Government.

        The Democrats accept the fact that essentially the amendments that are being brought forward at this stage address a number of anomalies. I am a little uncertain procedurally, Mr Chairman, as to how I can address the two Democrat amendments which were processed by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration when I was not there. I apologise for my non-appearance at that Committee meeting, but the Democrats do have a problem with trying to service a range of portfolios simultaneously. We have always said that, whilst we support the concept of the reference of Bills to committees, we may sometimes, or perhaps even often, not necessarily be able to meet the requirements there and we reserve the right to address in this process amendments we might have. I have previously circulated two amendments. We are not actually speaking to the report of the Committee at this stage, are we?

        This amendment relates to the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. As I said during the second reading debate, this amendment was intended to prevent a group falling through the net. A certain number of widows would not qualify for bereavement benefit because an Act of 1922 determines their entitlements. I am advised that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) considers that this would be more appropriately addressed elsewhere. Therefore, I withdraw this amendment. I give notice that we will raise the matter when the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill comes before the chamber. It is the view of our party room that that is a more appropriate place to address it. So I withdraw the amendment relating to the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill circulated in the name of the Australian Democrats.

        The Committee is aware that under clause 37 there is provision for those who undertake to serve on to receive retention benefit payments in a lump sum. The argument advanced to us by some potential recipients is that by receiving the lump sum they will incur a higher taxation level. I understand the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has a response to that. We have put forward this amendment at the request of potential recipients. Perhaps if they are misinformed, and if we are misinformed, the Minister could correct that. However, I would like to proceed with the amendment on behalf of the people who have approached us.

         â€”The Government opposes the Australian Democrats amendments, basically on two grounds. Firstly, the actual level of the retention bonus was set with the understanding of what the taxation level would be; that is, we did not determine a retention bonus and then look at the taxation consequences later. In setting the bonus the taxation consequences were looked at, and that bonus was regarded as being at a sufficient level for retention purposes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Secondly, the great difficulty with the alternative that Senator McLean is putting up is that if we take the tax out year by year there is no retention bonus any more. Someone can serve one or two years and then just go because there is no incentive to stay. With the retention bonus there is that incentive. Once the taxation arrangements are changed to make it year by year, it is a year by year decision as to whether people stay. We want people to stay through to the 20-year period. For those two reasons the Government opposes the Democrats amendment.

As a retention bonus was part of the Opposition's policy for defence personnel at the last election, it was an issue which I had looked at a couple of years ago.

        . . . the amendments which are being proposed by the Australian Democrats raise matters that require detailed assessment in financial terms-for example, their effect on budgetary and taxation matters.

       <para>
        It was for that reason that we believed the appropriate committee would be the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The fact that the Democrats did not have anybody to represent them at that Committee meant that those questions were not tested; therefore, the financial justifications and implications, if any, were not made available to the Committee and there was no opportunity to have them tested. I think it is a great pity.

        Opposition senators on the front bench carry the same burdens as the Democrat spokesmen. I believe that we have fewer staff than they do, and we also find the committee system a considerable pressure. Therefore, I cannot give a great deal of sympathy to the Democrats, who, having pressed for these amendments to go to committee, did not attend the Committee hearing when the opportunity offered. I think those whom they purport to represent were ill-served by their absence-if their hearts were really in presenting the amendments. The Opposition supports the Government in opposing the amendment.

         â€”I would like to address the comments of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) first and then respond to the comments of Senator Newman. I accept what the Minister is saying about the taxation impact having been taken into account when the level of retention payment was considered. I think it is probably difficult for the recipients and potential recipients to accept that a benefit is paid and then to be clobbered to the extent of 36 per cent. Therefore, I suggest that the message that is coming to the Government and to me is that the retention benefit is inadequate-if, in fact, it is acknowledged that there is a 36 per cent tax impact on it.

       <para>
        I believe it would be possible to legislate in such a way that people who intended to walk away with one, two, three or four years benefit at some point along the line could incur penalty. Therefore, people would not view it as something that is to be stolen but as something that is genuinely proposed as a retention benefit. I do not accept what the Minister is saying-that is, on the one hand, that the level of benefit is sufficient to acknowledge a 36 per cent tax impact and, on the other hand, that it is not possible legislatively to overcome the possibility of some people walking away and stealing a benefit which is intended to keep them in service.

        Frankly, Senator Newman's comments are misinformation. It is hardly worth engaging in debate, but I think the fact that she has misinformed those who are listening to this debate warrants a response. When she says that the people on the front bench in the Opposition have the same loads as ourselves, she is simply not acknowledging the realities. I happen to be a party Whip and four times a shadow Minister and I have no additional resources to address that.

        I hope that it will be accepted that it is not always possible for people to attend committees. This debate has the same standing as the debate on these amendments which would have occurred in another place. The fact that it is logistically possible only for me to do it here is something that only I can decide. Senator Newman's comments are irrelevant and misleading and, frankly, border on dishonest representation of the relative positions.

         â€”I thought that in the time available to me I would respond to some of the issues that have been raised in this debate by Opposition senators-issues such as free speech, the experience in the United States, certainly the question of the views of the Human Rights Commissioner, and the general issue of disclosure. As I was saying late last night, it is very easy to engender an emotional response from people when the terms `free speech' and `freedom of speech' are invoked. It is a pity this has happened because it is obvious to anyone with an interest in civil liberties that, despite the hypocritical cant and humbug which has been mouthed since the ban on political advertising was first mooted, this fundamental question of freedom of speech warrants very careful consideration in relation to the proposed ban.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not deny that there is a certain infringement on free expression in imposing this ban. However, to my mind, this is not a sufficient argument in itself. The real question is whether any denial of rights is a greater danger than those dangers it would supplant. I believe that the answer to that question is unequivocally no.
       </para>
       <para>
        The seriousness of the situation that we face in the Australian political process means that we have to limit campaign expenditure and we have to fully disclose that campaign expenditure. I have been sickened by the stream of self-serving invocation of principles of free speech by various self-anointed experts in the media who, I believe, with very little reflection but a great deal of financial self-interest, have mouthed words of moral outrage and cynically used concepts of public interest to advance their own causes. Milton Cockburn, in the Sydney Morning Herald a couple of years ago, put it this way:
       </para>
       <para>
        Before hearts begin to bleed for the television moguls, it is worth recalling that their main concern is being deprived of the windfall revenues that they have received every three (or fewer) years from election campaigns.
       </para>
       <para>
        The classic example of this unbridled outrage comes from a so-called editorial by Mr Jeremy Cordeaux of radio station 2GB in Sydney. Mr Cordeaux said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me have my say before free speech is completely lost in this country, and that's what this gag on election advertising is-it is the most frightening erosion of free speech we have ever seen in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        He asserts that. He does not have any arguments to back up his claim. Presumably we are expected to take it as self-evident that no rational or intellectually tenable argument even has to be put.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no suggestion-nor has there ever been any suggestion-that anyone would lose the right to express their political opinion. In fact, I think it is extraordinary that a talkback radio host could make such a claim because it is not unknown for the odd talkback host to cut off their listeners from time to time. I do not think that is unique to Sydney radio; I believe that happens all around this country. I really think the only problem Mr Cordeaux is likely to find is if his capacity to say what he wants is lost, and the only way that could possibly happen is if Mr Cordeaux's ratings become so bad that the management of 2GB decides that he ought not to be on air any longer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has also talked about the experience in the United States. I think it is a very valuable experience to examine, because there the whole system is out of control and there is a corrupting of the processes of government. I do not think anyone would want to see Australia go down that path. In the United States, the cost of electioneering-that is, overwhelmingly for political advertising-is the reason why the highly suspect political action committees were started for fund raising purposes. Campaign costs in the United States are positively frightening by Australian standards. This should give pause to my colleagues here in the Senate because US senators must raise, on average, $10,000 every week for the whole of their six-year term.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think this insatiable need for money, when combined with the lack of party discipline in voting in both Houses, makes US politicians particularly susceptible to influence buying. Australia has a long way to go before we reach that state. The escalating costs of campaign advertising mean that we need to nip this problem in the bud before it goes any further. Of course, Electoral Commission figures show that television and radio advertising expenditure is by far the most important cost in campaigns; because of that, it clearly ought to be the main target.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Government's objective in this legislation is to make our system more democratic by removing, as far as it is possible to do so, the influence of money. A fellow named Philip Stern wrote a book recently called The Best Congress Money can Buy. In it he wrote this:
       </para>
       <para>
        Far too often money determines who shall run for office. All too often money determines what messages will be conveyed. Much too often money is a preoccupation or an obsession in the minds of the law makers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet that prime determinant, money, is a poor tool of democracy, for money is indifferent to truth and to justice, since it is essentially unjustly distributed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In equating electronic political advertising with free speech we are really talking about the notion that spending money equals free speech. As Philip Stern pointed out, that is a fallacy because there is an unequal and unjust distribution of money. To understand this, the best illustration of it is spending on advertising in the 1990 Federal election campaign, when over $15m was spent on broadcast advertising--

         â€”I will get to that. That accounted for almost half the total expenditure of the party campaigns. The breakdown of the spending-and it is not just the spending of the major parties but also of the so-called third parties; that is, the little people, the groups that the Opposition and the Democrats are so fond of referring to when they talk about the denial of freedom of speech and those who would be most likely to suffer from a ban-is very illuminating. Of the $1.7m expended by third parties on broadcast advertising, $1.1m alone was spent by logging interests, with the Australian Conservation Foundation able to come up with only about $26,000.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Who else featured prominently in the breakdown? Luxury car dealers and pharmacists who, I suppose, are hardly examples of the poor and the dispossessed in our society. Let me say quite explicitly that it is impossible, given that this sort of money has to be raised, for any major party to avoid going cap-in-hand to the corporate sector in order to fund a modern political campaign. Any number of examples right across the political spectrum graphically demonstrate the dangers in that situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is, in the broader sense, a lessening of the right to free speech. But that is free speech for the few. It is free speech for the wealthy; it is free speech for the powerful; and it is free speech only for the vested interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has also raised the question of the attitude of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, on whether this legislation complies with Articles 19(2) and 19(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Australia is a party. Article 19(2) requires parties to guarantee the right of freedom of expression. This right is not absolute, as Article 19(3) makes clear. It provides that the right may be limited in the interests of political order.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition scorns the advice that the Government has received from the Government's official legal advisers from the Attorney-General's Department that the legislation's aim of preventing political corruption falls within the meaning of Article 19(3), which means that the legislation does not breach the Covenant. All of a sudden it prefers to listen to the view of a man whose job it has vowed to scrap if it wins Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        To fully understand the expedient and cynical nature of this view the Opposition is espousing, we need listen only to the words of the then shadow Attorney-General, Neil Brown, who was interviewed on the ABC's Law Report after he announced the Liberal Party hatchet job on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in October 1989. In reference to the monitoring of Australia's obligations under the international conventions-we have to bear in mind that he was saying this in the context of getting rid of the Commission-he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Well I'm quite satisfied that the lawyers of the Attorney-General's Department will exercise their function with true detachment and independence of mind. I think non-lawyers often think that it's impossible for lawyers to do that, but most lawyers realise that it can and is done on a daily basis by lawyers. So, I don't really have any concerns about that . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I would be quite happy myself, to have the Department itself and lawyers in the Department, look at our international obligations and whether they are being complied with under these conventions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that Neil Brown himself has answered the case that the Opposition has put forward. Unfortunately, I do not have time today to canvass the nature of political advertisements, to examine what they add to the democratic process and whether they provide information. They distort and trivialise the political process. I believe that they conceal, rather than reveal, genuine information. I think that Phillip Adams said it all when he described them as `about as worth defending as graffiti slogans sprayed on the walls of public buildings or the obscenities scrawled on loos'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the short amount of time available to me I would like to turn to the second aspect of the Government's reforms, the full disclosure provisions. I think the hypocrisy of the Opposition really rises to new heights when we look at the disclosure provisions. Make no mistake about it, it does not want full disclosure. It asserts that it is prepared to support full disclosure but it manoeuvres and twists and turns to ensure that in the end it can vote against full disclosure while still maintaining it supports it. That is all to keep its party organisation happy. The Liberal Party secretariat has made it clear that it has always been opposed to disclosure and it always will be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why should disclosure be an issue? As we are all aware, the soaring costs of election campaigns have made all parties increasingly dependent on outside donations from corporations and various interest groups. Quite simply, the rationale for full disclosure is that it allows voters to determine for themselves whether an incumbent or a candidate is or will be at the beck and call of the interest groups, corporations or individuals who have helped finance and fund a political campaign. In other words, it protects it against influence peddling, which, in effect, is corruption. The right of the public to know about and to judge the significance of donations outweighs, in my opinion, the right of donors to confidentiality.
       </para>
       <para>
        All major parties in this country have been guilty at times of exploiting glaring loopholes in the current Federal legislation. Now this Government has taken a stand to close those loopholes and to make disclosure meaningful. The first loophole to be closed is that which allows front organisations to be set up to launder donations and protect the identities of donors. Perhaps the most famous example of that is the National Free Enterprise Foundation which was established to filter about $300,000 to its National Party Queensland candidates, free of public reporting provisions. In the 1990 Federal election we saw Liberal Party sponsored vehicles, such as the Centurion Club and the 200 Club. They were used as similar fronts for private donors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other infamous loophole in the current legislation is that it allows donations to parties for non-election or administrative purposes to be exempt from all disclosure provisions. I do not believe that it is valid to make a distinction between election and non-election related activities for political parties. If any validity could be discovered it is outweighed by the opportunities that the current situation provides for manipulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revelations of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct in Queensland have shown what a joke political finance is and, in particular, the reporting provisions of donations. Judge Roden, Assistant Commissioner for the ICAC investigation into the north coast development in New South Wales, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is beyond question that if politicians or political parties are paid money and then do favours, that is a form of corruption.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The alternative to compulsory public disclosure, I believe, is an unacceptable risk that through financial necessity, influence with Government (of any political colour) will be a purchasable commodity.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the linkage between all these strands is quite clear. We do need to curtail ever rising campaign expenditure. Electronic advertising forms the major part of that expense. For this reason alone, it ought to be stopped. If we examine the worthless nature of electronic advertising then that certainly adds strength to this argument that there should be a ban on electronic advertising in election campaigns. It is clear that both disclosure and the electronic advertising ban are linked. It is a package that the Government has brought forward. It ought to be dealt with as a package. As the Government has claimed all along, these reforms deserve support. If they do survive the process of the select committee and the processes of the Senate, then I think this will be perhaps the most significant step ever taken in Australia to remove the sleaze factor in Australian politics.

         â€”I would like to congratulate Senator Faulkner on an excellent speech. We have heard a truly objective and thorough analysis of what this issue is all about. It stands in marked contrast to the quality of the debate on this issue that we heard in the chamber last night. Indeed, I sought the call last night in order to speak to the people who might have been listening to the debate. We really were subjected to a diatribe of distortion from the Opposition which needed a response from the Australian Democrats. Senator Faulkner has responded on behalf of the Government. On behalf of the Australian Democrats I am responding to the diatribe that we were subjected to last night in anticipation of further diatribe from the Opposition in the debate on this issue this morning.

       <para>
        It is worth reminding ourselves precisely where we are in this debate. We are actually debating an amendment moved by Senator Powell to the proposition that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill be referred to a committee. Senator Powell has suggested from the very beginning of this debate that the two fundamental issues which are rolled into one in this legislation-namely, political advertising and disclosure of political donations-should be separated. The first issue should go to a committee, because it is an issue about which there needs to be much deliberation and much public participation; the second issue, disclosure, should be addressed now. That is the essential thrust of Senator Powell's amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking to the proposed reference to a committee last night, a number of Opposition senators simply distorted the reality incredibly and, most of all, distorted the position taken by the Australian Democrats on this matter. In doing so, there was almost overwhelming evidence of the need for our attention to be drawn to the issue of how politicians present themselves to their constituents. Not only is there distortion through the mechanism of political advertising and failure to disclose the moneys which fund that process, but also there is gross distortion in the debate about whether there needs to be disclosure and whether we need to regulate political advertising. I commend Senator Faulkner for the objective evidence that he contributed to this debate a few minutes ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not too sure how young I was when I learned one of the most fundamental lessons in life. I know that I was very young when I learned that if people listen to somebody who is prejudiced, biased and bigoted, they find that out of the mouths of the prejudiced, biased and bigoted does not come the truth. On this issue enormous prejudice, bias and bigotry are being expressed by Opposition members. They pretend to be stating the Democrats position.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the listeners and to the readers of this debate that they would be better to trust their own judgments rather than to trust the judgment of Senator Kemp, Senator Vanstone and Senator Olsen on the Democrats attitude on this issue. I would like to state clearly the fundamental and simple position of the Democrats in relation to this legislation. Senator Parer, who is in the chamber, has vigorously distorted this very important issue over the months of this debate. He has correctly told the constituency that it is an important issue. He has correctly told the constituency that there is certainly a fundamental issue at stake; that is, freedom of speech. I admire that. Of course, it is true. It is self-evident that it is true; but it is also true and self-evident that Senator Parer has grossly distorted our position on this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to state very clearly where we have been on this issue all along. We have said from the very beginning that all is not well in relation to political advertising. If proof is needed that the Democrats have been saying that for some time, honourable senators should go back to the debates of our former leader, Senator Macklin, and they will see that he raised over and over again in this place the question of honesty in political advertising. He referred to the fact that politicians are exempt from the provisions and requirements of the Trade Practices Act which says that if ordinary people advertise any product that they want to promote on the market, they have to do it honestly; yet under the Trade Practices Act politicians are not obliged-there is no obligation in law-to be honest in their political advertising.
       </para>
       <para>
        Michael Macklin, a former Senator and Democrat leader, has said over and over again in this place-he has brought it to our attention and it has been debated in this chamber-that honesty in political advertising is fundamental to the health of a democracy. We have said that for years. Therefore, when legislation came before us which focused partly on that issue, we embraced it as an opportunity to truly address it honestly, not to distort it.

        The clarification is that from the beginning we have rejected the concept of a total ban on political advertising. We have focused upon the issue of honesty in that advertising. We have said that the way to achieve that honesty is through regulation of that advertising. We will only come to grips with the whole problem associated with dishonesty in political advertising if we simultaneously come to grips with disclosure of where political parties get their money to do it. We have always acknowledged that the two issues of honesty in political advertising and disclosure of donations to that process are fundamental and vital. Therefore, in many respects, we welcome the opportunity that is provided by this legislation.

There has never been any deal done.

        The distortions that we have heard from the Opposition in this debate, directed at our attitude towards the legislation-and we will hear more in the next hour or so-are proof positive that the whole question of political statement is riddled with distortion in this chamber, and absolutely riddled with distortion when projected as political advertising.

       <para>
        What is evident to me and to many who have watched this debate is that the Opposition is slowly but surely achieving its fundamental and primary objective of leaving things exactly as they are. That is because its constituency is the privileged. Its constituency is made up of those who have access to sufficient dollars, whether through political donation or otherwise.

Along the line, the Opposition has grossly distorted our position on this matter, which has been quite simple: to reject any total ban on political advertising from the beginning; and to pursue two very clear objectives-truth in advertising and disclosure of public donations to political parties. They are two matters which must, in the best interests of our democracy, be addressed.

The Opposition-the Liberal Party and the National Party-supports the reference of this Bill to a committee. I cannot recall a more draconian Bill coming before this chamber in my time. It is draconian for its attacks on democracy and on the foundations of a democratic society and for the consequent abridgment of human rights that comes from that attack on the democratic principles of this society.

The only wonderment I have about this Bill is that the public protest has been as muted as it has been. The only conclusion one can come to is that the Government has done a pretty good job on keeping it quiet and that word has not got out as to what is involved in the Bill.
       </para>

        I do not wish to spend time talking about the Democrats claim that the Liberal Party is pursuing the status quo. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are always interested in preserving democracy. We are not interested in preserving inequities or injustices in society. Our whole history in this country, ever since Federation, has shown that the parties on the Liberal side and the anti-Labor side have been at the forefront of the protection and the advancement of democratic principles. That is what we are on about in opposing this Bill.

       <para>
        This Bill has two parts to it: firstly, a ban on political advertising in the electronic media, both in radio and in television; and, secondly, a disclosure of donations- but a disclosure in a bizarre and perverted way. We have every objection to a ban on political advertising in the electronic media because it is grossly unfair. It is a debasement of the human rights of an individual in Australian society to put his views forward and to be heard, and it gives a great advantage to the government of the day.

       <para>
        There is not a Prime Minister who will not be guaranteed through an election campaign adequate time to express a point of view on a television or radio station.

       </para>
       <para>
        With respect to the disclosure of political donations, we are happy to have full, free and equitable disclosure. We are not happy to have the bully boys from the labour movement come along to stand over some private individual because he gives $100,000 to the Liberal Party and bludgeon him with the intimidation tactics that have been so much a consequence of disclosure when the Australian Labor Party has known about it. We are not prepared to sit back and see tens of millions of dollars come out of union funds-and who knows what out of the superannuation funds that the unions will have in the future-and go into Labor Party slush funds. But I shall deal with that later.

        Firstly, I want to deal with the comments that have been made by apolitical bodies within Australia. The first comment I refer to is that of the Law Council, a body of absolutely no political affiliation. It said that this Bill is so badly drafted that one cannot determine what is in it. There have been protests from the Australian Medical Association. The Media Council of Australia said that it is incredulous over the wide ranging applications and ramifications of this Bill and it cannot understand why people are not marching in the streets. APEA, the Automobile Association of Australia and the Real Estate Institute have protested against it. The Press Council considers the legislation to be unconstitutional.

        Yesterday the Salvation Army wrote to me. One of the very interesting points that the Salvation Army raised is that, where literacy is a real factor in the Australian community, illiterate people gain a great deal of their information on society through what they hear. They hear and they see through the electronic medium, not through the print medium. Those people will be denied the opportunity of exposure to political viewpoints from people within the country.

        Yesterday I received a letter from the Australian Parents Council.

        Not only will political parties be denied the right to put their point of view in the form of paid advertisements before the Australian electorate through election campaigns, but anyone in the community who has an interest in projecting some viewpoint before the community will be denied the opportunity of doing so because it will be deemed that that point of view will be likely to influence the outcome of the election in one way or another. Any groups which are critical of the Government, the way that welfare groups are constantly asking for increased funding, will be unable to ask for more funds for the blind or for the disabled or any other welfare service in the community because it will be deemed that their claims are political advertising and they will be banned under the Act. Even the current affairs programs are suspect because the Labor Party will only have to claim that a current affairs program may have influenced the outcome of a future election for it to be banned.

        The fundamental point is that the right of free speech, the very basis of the democratic system of the Government of Australia, is being eroded and severely curtailed by this denial of free speech. That is a characteristic, of course, of all totalitarian regimes. While this Government is not a totalitarian regime, it certainly exhibits some of the tendencies of one. The Government is obviously desperately trying to retain power. Under its guidance we have seen the collapse of the Australian economy and Australian society.

        We are involved in the second great depression of this century. Let me remind the Senate that the first Great Depression of this century occurred under the Scullin Labor Government of the early 1930s. Today in Australia we have 700,000 unemployed, plus hundreds of thousands who have given up putting their names on unemployment lists out of total despair that they will ever get a job. We have 28.5 per cent of teenagers unemployed-an absolutely staggering figure. It is the highest total we have had since the Great Depression. Of the people who should be entering the work force to be trained and contributing to the future growth of this country, 28.5 per cent are unemployed.

       <para>
        I spend a fair bit of my time talking to university graduates. The one characteristic of university graduates now is despair. That is probably the most telling criticism of this Government. When one talks to people aged 28 or 30 who have worked their way through a university career-most of them have jobs but a number of them do not-about how they see Australia, instead of being full of zest, drive and enthusiasm for the careers that are before them, for the community they live in and for the country they are resident in, all one finds is the comment that we are now a Third World country. I find that absolutely terrible. I never had that view when I was a graduate. I was proud to live in this country, I was proud to contribute to the society and I was eager to make my contribution in my own profession. But today, if one asks lawyers, doctors, dentists and engineers how they see the future, all one hears is despair. I think that is a terrible criticism.

       <para>
        We have falling standards of living, the collapse of the Australian manufacturing industry, and an uncontrollable balance of payments position where the $30 billion debt that existed when this Government came into power has blown out to $130 billion. Why in those circumstances would the Government-particularly when it has no commitment to democratic principles-not move to curtail any challenge to its retention of power? That is what this is all about: the retention of power. It is not about fairness in elections, disclosure or anything else; it is merely about the pursuit of power through any means.
       </para>
       <para>
        No Government, no party and no parliamentarian with any comprehension, let alone any regard or respect for the democratic system, would contemplate the legislation that is before us today. I am not surprised that the Labor Party has brought it up, but I am surprised that the Democrats have played footsy with it for so long because the issues are black and white. If one understands what democracy is about, one cannot support this ban on advertising.

        The only reason the Democrats have changed their position at the present time is that the current leader pro tem is under challenge. Something like 100 of her supporters or members of the Party-probably 70 per cent of the Party-have written in and said, `Hey, the leadership is on the line. We do not agree with you'. One of the really tragic things that this has exposed has been the collapse of the Democrats. We now have a Party which has gone downhill ever since its founder, Don Chipp, left it. We had the nasty machinations whereby Senator Haines, as she then was, completely got rid of the successor to Senator Chipp, Senator Siddons. From that point the Party started to lose credibility, but the real collapse has come under the present leadership of Senator Powell. I look forward very much to whoever her successor might be because it will be an improvement. The Australian Democrats which once had some principles--

They are into any sort of issue where they think they can pick up 100 votes. They have no political philosophy at all and they have no concept of democracy. If this legislation goes through we will be well down the road to a one-party state. That will be the consequence of it.

        The second part of the Bill deals with donations. We favour frank, full and open disclosure of donations but, as I said in the opening part of my speech, we are not going to be part of the formula proposed by the Labor Party whereby it can raise tens of millions of dollars from the union movement without the consent or approval of the unionists who have their fees compulsorily levied from them, and we are not going to expose people who make contributions to any party to the risk of intimidation by the bully boys of the union movement. That is a reality; that is one of the real things in the world today.

        I did not have any intention of speaking at length on the donations side because I think the case is so clear that it is transparent. But one of the previous speakers, a senator from the union movement in New South Wales, made some quite sanctimonious statements about where the Liberal Party might have got its funds from and that provoked me to go to my files and get the submissions for the Labor Party for the 1987 election by one Robert Francis McMullan, who was then the General Secretary. I find this a very interesting document. It did not fall off the back of a truck; it is a public document that one can obtain. We find that in the period preceding the 1987 election the total value of all gifts received by the ALP Federal Secretariat in Canberra was $2,981,062. When we go through the list we find some great surprises. There is a long list of six or seven pages of donations from organisations such as the Australian Workers Union of $25,000; from the AMWU national council political fund account, $100,000; and from the Operative Painters and Decorators Union of Australia, $3,500.

I have never raised funds for a political party, but I would imagine it is rather hard to find donations of $55,000, as we have here in 1987 from the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia. We have these pages and pages of donations at around the $50,000 to $100,000 mark, building up into millions, out of the union movement. No other party can garnishee the profits or the takings of the union movement the way the Labor Party can, and that is the system it wants to enshrine through legislation.

        When we go through the pages of this document-and remember I said it was about $2.9m-we come to the final entry and we find there is a body called the ALP Legacies and Gifts Ltd, 22 Brisbane Avenue, Barton, ACT. This would have to be the grandaddy of all slush funds. I would like the said Robert Francis McMullan, since he is now a senator, to explain to the Senate some time just what the ALP Legacies and Gifts Ltd is, because out of a total contribution of $2.9m we find that nearly $2m comes from the ALP Legacies and Gifts Ltd.

        Senator Harradine, with his great experience of the Labor Party, is smiling. He knows, the way I know, that it is the old mates who contributed to that. That would be TNT, that would be News Ltd, that would be Bondy, that would be all sorts of old mates who are up for dinner at the Lodge every time they are in town.
       </para>
       <para>
        This leads to the whole reason for the legislation coming before the Senate. Look at the balance sheets today: where is TNT, where is News Ltd, where is Bondy, where is Skase? He has fled the country. All the old mates are in trouble. So $2m out of $2.9m from this slush fund is no longer there. Their idea of a level playing field, since their income has declined, is to bring in this declaration of full disclosure, to preserve their vested interest within the fundraising world.

       <para>
        In addition, before I leave the ALP fundraising, I might say that what I read out there related to the Federal Secretariat. It must be remembered that the State secretariats also had contributions from unions. I have the figures for the same election from the Queensland Secretariat. We find there that the Seamen's Union of Australia kicked in $10,506, the Australian Workers Union $18,450, the Queensland Colliery Employees Union $8,690, and so on. They were getting it on all sides.

        In conclusion, this legislation is a blatant attack on the democratic principles on which this society was founded and on which our government is based. It takes us down the first step to a one-party state. It has all the hallmarks of a totalitarian regime, and it must be opposed right at the outset. The denial of funding, the denial of advertising, are potent weapons in the hands of the government of the day and have no part in a democratic society.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say this with the greatest of respect: it is the first step to a one-party state, and the next step will be the elimination of all elections. I can remember a leader of another socialist party, in the 1930s, who made that part of his policy. In 1933 or 1934 he said that the next election will be the last one.

         â€”Today we are debating the referral of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 to a select committee. This, of course, is welcomed very much by the Opposition-the Liberal and National parties-even though it has taken an inordinate amount of time, yet again, for the Australian Democrats to wake up that this was a necessary course of action, that this was such a complicated piece of legislation, and a piece of legislation that had disastrous consequences for the nation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the last week or so we have seen Senator Powell, the temporary Leader of the Australian Democrats, in an effort to shore up her leadership, suddenly coming up with the idea as though it was something new and revolutionary that we can send the Bill off to a committee. `That seems a good idea', she said, `so I am going to recommend that we send it off to a committee'. At the end of the last session she refused point blank to send this Bill off to a committee and now she is considering it something revolutionary, the same way in which Senator McLean was talking a little while ago. Needless to say, with Senator Spindler wandering around the chamber from time to time, he is probably going to say the same thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter we are talking about is a clear example that the Hawke-Keating-Kerin Government's days are numbered-thank heavens-because, on top of the economic disasters that it has set upon this country, we have this hopeless Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) who is absolutely unable to acknowledge that to gag free speech in Australia is simply not on. People from all sections of the community-as my colleague Senator MacGibbon has just outlined-have protested very angrily and for long enough now for the Government to at last recognise that it is not just the Liberal and National parties that value free speech; it is also valued by many people in the community. Look at how many people have actually set about signing petitions to this Parliament to express their desire not to have free speech wiped out by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has had more positions on this Bill than the Kama Sutra, I will go so far as to say, but his second last position to date was to prohibit advertising during election campaigns. Was that not a smart idea? `We will advertise as a Government all the way along the line, and we will advertise in government departments right up to an election campaign, we will tell you what a wonderful job we have done and what a wonderful job we are going to do in the future, yet no-one else will be able to tell the Australian community what they are going to do.

Is it that his wealthy mates have all gone bust, or are living the high life in Spain? Is it that the party is simply broke, both of money and ideas? Is it that the Minister recognises that the Hawke-Keating-Kerin Government is so on the nose that it could not be sold in a chook raffle? Is it that they cannot figure out a way to tell the people of Australia that unprecedented high levels of unemployment and losing their jobs is good for them? Is it that they have not yet figured out a way to paint some pretty pictures that record bankruptcies is a real hoot and also good for the Australian people? Or is it that the Minister-simply no more, no less-wishes to impede political communication in a democracy, because it seemed like a good idea at the time?

        I honestly think that maybe it is a combination of all of those things, but the latter is probably more close to the point than anything else, because the Minister has acted so illogically over all of this. He has not been able to explain to the Parliament, or the public, why he has set about this course of action, but of course the other part of the Bill-to disclose political donations-is just an amazing position by this Minister as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday the Minister in his speech on this referral motion mentioned that the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, had supported the other aspect of the Bill to which I just referred-stopping advertising. The Minister at no stage gave any explanation as to why he made that statement, yet he is talking about truth in advertising.
       </para>

        I digressed there for a moment. Coming back to disclosure, the party that has really had the problem with disclosure over recent years is not the coalition-it happens to be the Labor Party.

         â€”Then, of course, we have stamps. The advertising accounts were very interesting because they allowed the Labor Party to ask companies to donate to the Labor Party but, instead of writing out cheques to the Australian Labor Party, they wrote them out to advertising account No. 1, advertising account No. 2 or advertising account No. 23, 24 or 25. Not only did the Labor Party not declare those as donations, but also the companies which donated them claimed them as a tax deduction.

        Here is the Party that is saying, `Oh, we've got to be honest. We've got to declare all our donations'. It has rorted the system blind in Western Australia. Mr Parker has now decided-only due to the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters-that he has to disclose all the money that he has kept in a briefcase. It has also been exposed in the Royal Commission that he used the money that was given to him for his re-election campaign to put a cash deposit on his private home.

        Of course, there is Mr Dowding, Mr Grill and, naturally enough, the now Senator Beahan who was State Secretary of the Australian Labor Party at the time and who aided and abetted in advertising accounts No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. He knew that the money was going into these fake accounts so that the Labor Party did not have to declare them and that the companies which donated could, in fact, claim a tax deduction illegally. So everyone else had to pay more tax, but the companies which donated to the Labor Party got a plus-a benefit.

        Senator McMullan, now Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, was Federal Secretary-or whatever it is called-of the Labor Party at the time.

         â€”The motion before the Senate is to refer the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill to a select committee of the Senate. That motion commences with the words, `noting the findings of Report No. 4 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters'. I was a member of that Joint Standing Committee and I have been through this backwards, forwards and out the other end. I am fully aware of the detailed consideration that that Committee gave to this whole question.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I might mention at the outset that, had the Government followed the recommendations of that Committee, it would have come up with a Bill which would be far more acceptable than the Bill which it has before the chamber at the present moment. I might mention, however, that I did write a dissent report to certain of the recommendations of that Committee. I do not want to canvass those here in the chamber because they are contained on page 135 of the report of that Joint Select Committee, entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to say a couple of things very briefly about this referral. I think it is important that this Bill be referred to a select committee because it raises a number of questions. Certainly, the public is sick and tired of the slick political image makers during election campaigns. The image makers and the minders of the political parties and political leaders will simply divert the money saved by this Bill to slick advertisements in the print media, magazines, video trailers, direct mail and junk mail and to costly inserts into daily newspapers, et cetera. There is no guarantee that the alleged primary purpose of this measure will be satisfied, that is, to remove the perceived inordinate reliance of political parties on money from the political process in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Besides expenditure in areas other than television advertising, the political parties will be able to pour money into the production of lavish campaign launches, with all the accompanying razzamatazz, which under this Bill the ABC and the commercial television stations will be required to carry. Together with current affairs programs, whose agendas are set by producers and the political minders of party leaders, and the 10-second news grabs, glib campaign launches will be the only political messages received by television viewers and radio listeners.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the views of community groups or individuals on policy issues do not happen to coincide with or are not considered important by political image makers or producers of talkback and current affairs programs, these community groups and citizens in general will be prevented by law from airing their views over television and radio. This is the bone of contention amongst a number of community groups which have written to honourable senators concerned about this question.
       </para>
       <para>
        Voters who rely on the electronic media for information are entitled to know where political parties and candidates stand on issues of concern and why they take that stand. It can be argued that this right has been sullied in recent political campaigns by the dominance of the glib image making television political advertisements inflicted on viewers by the political parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there are ways to reverse this costly dominance without resorting to decisions which attack civil and political rights. This is a matter which, of course, the proposed committee will have to consider. It is a very important aspect to which reference was made in Report No. 4 of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune. I wish the proposed committee well in considering that matter, because it must be considered.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a disconcerting feature-which may be tending towards a dangerous feature-of our political process that election campaigns are becoming so costly that they are way out of the reasonable range of political parties reliant on their members for financial support. Perhaps the committee which will be set up could consider the question of ceilings being placed on expenditure by political parties during political campaigns. It might also consider the extension of free political broadcasts which should be of such duration and format as to ensure that political parties and candidates deal with elections as serious topics for debate, rather than as subjects for a shampoo commercial or the like.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other aspects of this Bill which might have resulted in a High Court challenge to any adverse election results by persons such as me or others in my situation. Depending upon what is meant by the term political party in an election and depending on what is meant by the party's chief executive officer, there could have been only two or three people in this existing Parliament who would have been denied the right to explain to the voters who rely on television and radio for information where they stand on issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as I can see, there is no definition of the party's chief executive officer in the legislation, and so far as I am aware there is no such definition in the principal Act. I am fairly familiar with the legislation because I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Depending on the definitions of those particular terms, the Government could have very quickly ended up in the High Court with a constitutional challenge to aspects of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I want to deal very briefly with this question of disclosure. I agree that there should be full, equitable disclosure provisions. I make one comment here: it is unwise and unfair to pre-judge what might emerge out of commissions of inquiry which are currently proceeding.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also make the observation that a number of people believed that at least one person was acting, according to his lights, in the best interests of a political party. That person has been left carrying the bag, and there is no money in it. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, who was previously in the chamber, might know what I am talking about. I am talking about the shuttle service between Sydney and Perth. It seems unfortunate that a particular person has been left carrying the bag. That person perceived that he was doing the right thing, but there was no money in that bag.

         â€”There have been very few occasions in the history of this country when a government has attempted to remove the freedoms that our citizens claim as their right. Each time this has occurred in the past the people have risen to the occasion and forced the Government to back down. They have not just relied on the Opposition of the day, but have taken action themselves to bring about that change.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Once again the people have risen to the occasion. We well remember the previous occasions because this Government, of all governments since Federation, has attempted to curtail the freedoms of its people. Let us look back at the Australia Card and how the people reacted to that. There were public meetings, marches in the streets and, finally, the Government was forced to drop it. We then come to the so-called Bill of Rights and what the Australian people did on that occasion. Again there were public meetings, marches, and the Government finally backed down.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we are on the same old issue-the banning of all political advertising. This is not just in the lead-up to an election, but it is for all time. These three attempts to do away with the rights of ordinary Australians are a clear demonstration to me of the true Labor Party. Its philosophy is that the people are subservient to the state because the state knows best what is good for the people. Our philosophy is that the state is subservient to the people, that the people know best what is to their good.

        Senator Bolkus, in attempting to tell the people of Australia that the Government will not permit them to criticise any political party through placing advertisements on radio or television has, once again, forced the Government virtually to throw out the legislation. Who does Senator Bolkus think he is? Who do members of the Labor Party think they are? They say to the Australian people, `We will not tolerate any criticism by the people of Australia of anything we have done or of anything that we intend to do. We will not put up with it. We will not allow you to place any advertisement on television or radio which is critical of us'. That is not applicable only to the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats, but to everyone else in Australia. They will not tolerate it. That does not just apply to the Federal Government. The Australian Labor Party has also tried to enforce this in the States. It has said, `We already own the majority of States and we will not tolerate any criticism of those States'. It also applies to local government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As an Australian, I have been extremely proud that in the past, according to a survey put out by Freedom House, entitled Freedom in the World, Australia has been one of 28 countries, out of 167, which have as top priorities freedom of political rights, civil liberties and general freedoms. Even countries such as France and Greece do not reach our high standard. We are referred to as having complete freedom and basic rights, freedom of speech in the media, in religion, in movement and in association, et cetera. If this legislation ever gets through that will no longer be the case. We will go out of that select group of countries and back to the types of countries which have less freedom. It would degrade our description in that survey.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have repeatedly asked Senator Bolkus what he is afraid of. Why does he want to throw out the advertisements the people of Australia might put up? He says that rorts and corruption could result. We know that there has been no corruption on our side. What corruption has occurred in the Labor Party that Senator Bolkus is so frightened of? We on this side have no fears.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can tell honourable senators what Senator Bolkus is frightened of. He is frightened that at the next election the Government will lose power. He is determined to hang on to power at any cost, even at the cost of taking freedoms from the country. He is frightened that the Brotherhood of St Laurence will accuse the Government of breaking promises. We all remember the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that no child would be living in poverty after 1990. Yet there are so many extra homeless children on the streets at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bolkus is frightened that St Vincent de Paul might accuse the Government of not doing enough for the poor, that it might say, `We need more money as we are treating so many more poor people', and that it might advertise on television and on the radio for people to help because the Government is not doing enough. Senator Bolkus is frightened that, as an Opposition, we might remind the people at the next election that the Prime Minister publicly admitted he had told a lie at the last election. He said that if he had not told the lie the Government would have lost the election. He is frightened that we might remind the people that they can no longer trust the Prime Minister to tell the truth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bolkus is frightened that Commissioner Burdekin, who reported on homeless youth, might accuse the Government of not taking up his recommendations on how to overcome the problem. He is frightened that the Opposition will remind the people of all the shenanigans that Brian Burke has been up to and of all the corruption that has occurred in Western Australia. He is frightened that we might remind the people, through a little advertisement of a rowing boat with Mr Hawke and all his mates almost foundering, of his promises on the gold tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bolkus is frightened that we might refer to Mrs Kirner and Mr Cain, and that we might remind the Victorian people of the problems and the corruption that have occurred in that State. He is frightened that we might remind the people in South Australia about their banking problems. This is what Senator Bolkus is frightened about. He is frightened that we might say to the people of Australia, `This is the unemployment rate that this Government has brought to the people'. He is frightened that we will say, `Of course, that rate is ever so much greater because the Government has hidden the figures', and tell people that the Bureau of Statistics figures show only people who say they have not done any work in the previous week or month.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Bureau of Statistics asks people whether they have done any work and they say, `Yes, I went out and helped a mate construct a fence', they are still entitled to unemployment benefits, but they are not classed as unemployed for the statistics of the Bureau of Statistics. Even if they were not paid for the hour's work that they did in a week, if they said they had done anything for an hour, remuneration or not, they were not classed in the Bureau of Statistics figures. Imagine what the true rate is! Even the Bureau of Statistics says that it is well over one million people. This is the sort of thing that Senator Bolkus is frightened of.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is also frightened that, come an election, the Opposition will remind the people of Australia that this Government has seen the largest number of bankruptcies in Australia's history. I remind people of a claim made by the Prime Minister a few years ago. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . let me make one point so that even our opponents can understand it; and let me make it beyond all their powers of misrepresentation and distortion. There will be no capital gains tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        What do we have? A capital gains tax. Who could trust the Prime Minister? Of course, Senator Bolkus is frightened that we will be saying this to the people of Australia with advertisements on television and radio. He is frightened that we will remind them that on 22 March 1990 Mr Keating said, `We won't let there be a recession', yet on 29 November Mr Keating said:
       </para>
       <para>
        And the first thing to say is the accounts do show that Australia is in a recession. The most important thing about that is that this is a recession that Australia had to have.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are the sorts of things about which we have Senator Bolkus so worried that he is willing to bring in this type of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is also worried that, when we are putting forward our goods and services tax, Dr Hewson may quote Mr Keating and Mr Hawke when they were saying in 1985 what a wonderful idea it was. He is also worried that we might start quoting the fact that Bob Hogg admitted he made a mistake on donations of $400,000; that Senator Loosley forgot to account for some donations; and that Senator McMullan, when he was national Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, also had such problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am glad to see Senator Tate in the chamber, because he was closely associated with the original disclosure legislation in 1987, and he knows that we know that he is aware of where Senator McMullan's skeletons are buried.

Let us stir the lot. These are the things that not only Senator Bolkus but also Senator Tate and all the others are terrified about, because people are handing things to us and we are getting to the bottom of the problems that they have had. Senator Bolkus is trying to stop us from bringing them to the attention of the Australian people.

        I reiterate that, according to this legislation for advertising, not only the Opposition but any other individual in Australia is stopped on any matter intended or likely-even if the intention is not there-to affect the voting at a Commonwealth, State or local government election. Let us be perfectly clear. From the moment the Bill is passed it will be the case that, not only in the lead-up to an election but for the whole time, no Australian will be able to advertise and express his or her view criticising a government-not only a government but also any individual member or any branch. We could not advertise and criticise the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party for its branch shenanigans, nor could any person in Victoria or New South Wales. That would be illegal-all wiped out. What lengths this Government will go to in its effort to wipe out any criticism of its actions!

       <para>
        Until Senator Powell said yesterday in her speech that the Democrats had never supported the complete ban on political advertising, I was not going to mention the Democrats. I would like to read from Hansard, because this morning Senator McLean said that we had distorted the Democrats' comments and views. Hansard does not lie, so I will read from it. On 20 June, regarding political advertising, Senator Powell said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Our priority is amendments which we have had before this place previously-most recently in May last year via former Senator Macklin-to introduce truth in advertising. At the moment, the Electoral Act is a licence to lie. We will put those amendments forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have also announced publicly that we want to regulate in the area of advertising to insist that political advertisements are informative and not just ad agency hype, which not only gobbles up money but also does not give any information to the voters. Our amendments will require a talking heads process. We will get those amendments before the political parties, the public and the people who have written to us, and we will discuss them and make comment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Powell said that the Australian Democrats were not against political advertising, but she was going to tell the people just how they would put that advertisement across. She is as much against political advertising as the Labor Party is, for the same reasons. The Democrats believe that the people are subservient to the state.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that the people have already made their views very clear. I do not know which group finally broke the camel's back, but I will read out the names of a few of the groups which have objected very strongly to this legislation: the Australian Petroleum Exporters Association, the Real Estate Institute, the Press Council, the Salvation Army, ACROD, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the National Federation of Blind Citizens, the Council of Civil Liberties, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the AMA, the Australian Parents Council, the Human Rights Commissioner, St Vincent de Paul, the Media Council of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Automobile Association of Australia, the advertising and broadcasting industries, the Vice-chancellor of the University of the Northern Territory, the Confederation of Australian Industry, Roy Morgan of Morgan Research, the Australian Council of Social Service, the National Farmers Federation, the Forest Industries Association, the head of the Journalism Department at the Queensland University, the Australian Mining Industry Council, and the Australian Free Enterprise Foundation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Going through that list, I would say that very few groups in Australia have not objected. It is a travesty to say that people are sick of advertisements at election time. People may well be-and I do not blame them-but they can turn off their televisions or put them on mute and go to make a cup of coffee. I cannot believe that Senator Schacht would agree that the alternative is not to allow people to express any view the Government does not like. It is such a travesty of freedom of speech. It is such a dreadful alternative that I do not know how Senator Tate could be party to it. I do not understand how he can face his electors and say, `I will not allow political advertising. I will forbid it and I will penalise any Australian who dares to place an advertisement criticising me, my branch and my political party or anyone else's'. I cannot believe that even Senator Tate would be party to that.

         â€”After hearing Senator Walters's remarks, I think she is trying to find a new definition of free speech. Senator Faulkner earlier today made some very pertinent points about the question of free speech. We all support free speech, but we do not support it if it means that someone can go out in the streets or to a public meeting and make false remarks about someone else's character. That is a limitation on absolute free speech. We all think that is the civilised way in which a society should conduct itself. There are limits on free speech in all democratic countries. Those limitations have been accepted as the only way in which a mature and sophisticated society can operate. When people start shouting about the need for free speech in absolute terms, they forget that even in this country there is no absolute free speech. We all accept that there have to be limitations. I believe that in this context it is not unreasonable to say that free speech should not be dependent upon one's ability to raise large amounts of money to pay for access to television and radio advertising.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        An overwhelmingly large number of those organisations whose names Senator Walters read out are organisations that have access to large amounts of money. She did not read out a long list of organisations at the very base of the community-for example, the play group associations and the pensioners groups at a very local level-which have political views and views about issues in society but have no access to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that are needed to pay for television and radio advertising. Her list was overwhelmingly the list of organisations that have the ability to raise the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars needed to pay for an effective television and radio campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        Figures have been published which show that in the last Federal election campaign the Forest Industries Association spent over $1m in advertising its view. The Australian Conservation Foundation spent $80,000. But, overwhelmingly, many other conservation groups in the community at a local grassroots level could not raise even the $80,000 that the ACF could to put some advertisements on. Overwhelmingly, Senator Walters in her list has indicated whom she really supports and who supports her and her political party. It is those vested groups that are able to raise the large amounts of money to dominate the political process. Her concept of free speech is free speech based on the power of money. Under no definition is that democratic. If we want a democratic society, it should be based on the right of all people to have equal and appropriate access to having their views heard and not on the ability to raise large amounts of money.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some speakers from the other side have mentioned that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill is in contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is one opinion given by some experts. Other experts give a different view. What I find extraordinary about the statements of the experts who say it is in contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is that that means that practically every other Western democracy is also in breach, in one form or another, of that Covenant, because most other Western countries have some form of limitation on political advertising on television and radio. I do not see people in those countries going to the International Court or the United Nations claiming that, for example, Sweden and Germany are in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because they ban paid television and radio advertising. If it is such a serious breach, I would have thought that people in those other Western democracies would be taking those cases up. They have not, because they know that on balance their democracy works better if the power of money to buy television and radio advertising is limited.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Faulkner's remarks today about the definition of free speech are very pertinent and I support them. We still have laws in some States that deal with blasphemy. People cannot get up and make blasphemous remarks while claiming the right to free speech, because there are laws that limit it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot make remarks about the state in some areas because it can be sedition. Society has always placed limits on free speech. There is always an argument-quite rightly-about what those limits are; that is part of the healthy debate of democracy. But never let it be said that this country has unfettered free speech. We have never had it. None of us have ever supported it because we believe that unfettered free speech may in fact do more damage to individuals than good. I support those limitations. So for Senator Walters and others opposite to claim great moral virtue about free speech is absolute humbug, and they know it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The conservative parties over the last 100 years in this country and elsewhere have been much more willing to take action against people on free speech and to curtail people's rights than have been the parties of the Left, such as the Labor Party. We have always been much more to the forefront in defending the rights of dissenters to argue against society. We are absolutely consistent because those opposite are the people who represent big money. They are the people who represent wealth. They want that wealth to have unfettered right to dominate the political process because they see it as an advantage for the interest groups they represent.

Let us not beat around the bush.

        I do not excuse the efforts of political parties, whether it is the Liberal Party, the National Party or my own, to make arrangements to raise large amounts of money. But why are they forced to raise the large amounts of money? Because political parties-whether it is the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or the National Party-know of the desperate need to raise large amounts of money to pay for their election campaigns. Once they start on that process of raising money, people's judgments start to err on the side of making some arrangement to raise that money and appear to give some favour.

         â€”I think I should get a higher duties allowance for answering these sorts of questions. I am not going to respond to the specifics of what particular people may say by way of commentary and have the agenda set for me in that respect. I will simply, very cheerfully, describe the Government's policy on interest rates and monetary issues. The point is-as everyone knows-a period of tight monetary policy was necessary in order to slow demand and reduce inflationary pressures. As evidence of slowing demand growth and falling inflation emerged, monetary policy has been progressively eased. There have now been eight easings since January 1990, the most recent of which was on 16 May, which have led to a fall in short term professional rates of 7 1/2 percentage points over that period since early 1990. As a result, business lending rates and home loan rates have fallen, as everyone knows, and are likely to fall further. However, recent easings have yet to impact fully on the economy. There is a lag time involved, as we all should know by now.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A host of factors is considered by the Government when reviewing the level of interest rates including, particularly, the achievement of a sustainable reduction in inflation and inflationary expectations and the level of economic activity. In this respect, inflation, as a relevant consideration, is clearly continuing to trend down, with our policies succeeding in reducing the annual inflation rate from over 11 per cent, when we came into office, to 3.4 per cent in the year to the June quarter. That-as, again, ought to be well appreciated-is the lowest annual increase since March 1970 after adjusting for Medicare effects and it is well below the latest annual average OECD inflation rate of 6.2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are confident that the economy is poised for a sustainable recovery and, indeed, the progressive easing of monetary policy over 1990-91 will be a major factor underpinning that recovery.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”Yes, I have seen the paper. It is a paper on reasons for the earnings gap between male and female workers of Australia. It is a paper by Professor John Nevile and Dr Binh Tran-Nam at a conference at the University of New South Wales on social and economic inequity. It is one of a series of papers which argue that the gender earnings gap is due only to a narrow definition of what is direct discrimination by employers. This paper proposed that only 4 per cent of the 35 per cent earnings gap between male and female rates is due to direct discrimination; that is to say, discrimination which is intended by employers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I query the value of this sort of conclusion. I do so because there is indirect, unintended, indifferent discrimination which is nonetheless discrimination; it matters little to the victims of discrimination whether it was intended with prejudice or intended with indifference because the impact on them is exactly the same.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other thing about this paper is that it adds to the argument of some in the community who wish to pretend that there is no, or virtually no, discrimination. This paper is misused in the way in which it is presented to bolster that type of conclusion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Importantly, though, this paper ignores the structural and systematic discrimination which characterises women in the Australian labour market. For example, it undervalues the importance or effect of deskilling of casual and part time work on women. It does not recognise that often or mostly work is organised around the role of the male as the breadwinner and, therefore, casual, temporary, part time work is work traditionally done by women and dominates work categories in which women are the most populous and that women rarely have anything like the same access to overtime that men have.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does not take account either of the clustering of women in occupations or industries in which their skills are undervalued because those areas are regarded as women's work. Until award restructuring came along-something that this Government supported in the 1987 national wage case-there were very few career options for women and their jobs were mainly dead-end jobs. Their job options have now to some extent opened up due to award restructuring.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is for these reasons that the Affirmative Action Agency has criticised the findings of this paper. The Government is firmly committed to removing the barriers. The pay equity unit in my Department to which Senator West referred was set up specifically to look at those issues. We believe that some progress has been made through the minimum rates adjustment process in awards in which classifications for women and men are linked because of the value of their work, the content of their work, and not characterised in women's work and men's work and thus have no comparative value. Award rates of pay for women have increased by 5 per cent in the 17 months to January 1990 due to the minimum rates adjustment process compared to a 4.4 per cent increase for males. I think that indicates that there is some impact on the problem. As I have said, the equal pay unit in my Department has had a hand in that, as have employers and unions dedicated to trying to remove this discrimination.

         â€”As Senator Crowley intimated, the G7 group of leading Western economic powers decided at its London summit meeting last month to endorse the establishment of a register of conventional arms transfers under the auspices of the United Nations. Such a register was also endorsed at an earlier meeting in Paris by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The establishment of the register has been recommended by the UN expert group on conventional arms transfers, which has been studying ways and means of enhancing transparency in such transfers. In its report, that expert group also encouraged all states to work towards greater openness on arms holdings and production. Australia is an active participant in the growing exchanges taking place on this issue, particularly in that expert group. We are looking to the finalisation of its recommendations, which will address these issues.

We certainly support the establishment of such a register. With that expert group's recommendations having been finalised, and with the support that now exists from the G7 and the P5, there is strong expectation of early action. I cannot put a date on when that will be achieved, but we are certainly going to be working actively for that result.

The figures that Senator Jones has brought to the attention of the chamber are quite horrifying. The latest figures that I was able to get indicate that there were some 300 murders in Australia in 1989-90 and that, of those, about 25 per cent were committed using weapons.

        The figures are not so bad, relatively speaking, when compared with that gun-ridden violent society which is part of the culture of the United States. Nevertheless, it is horrifying that some 75 or so murders in Australia in that year were committed using weapons or explosives. I suppose what is even more tragic for us in Australia is that in the same year there were 450 suicides which involved the use of weapons. That is, of course, a terrible tragedy also.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the honourable senator's question about what governments are doing. Constitutionally, the possession and control of firearms is a matter for State governments. The Australian Police Ministers Council has been trying to come to a common position for some years. It has been aided in that by the report of the National Committee on Violence, which was set up by the Prime Minister and all Premiers in response to the Hoddle Street and Queen Street massacres which shocked the nation. Certain recommendations made by that committee, in relation to the better control of firearms within State jurisdictions, are being considered by the various States.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, our responsibility lies with the importing of weapons into Australia. In that regard, with the cooperation of the Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr David Beddall, I was able to ensure that there were no further imports into Australia of semi-automatics of a military kind or of a look-alike military kind based on Russian Red Army models and Chinese Army models. That regulation has taken effect. With the support of the Senate, it has been in place for a couple of months. This is, at least, an attempt to help change the culture in Australia so far as the importing of those types of weapons is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think all governments are very concerned to help change the culture towards a less violent gun-ridden society-if it is possible to do so-not only through use of the import regulations in regard to certain sorts of weapons but also in relation to laws relating to possession and control within various jurisdictions.

        The reason I proposed the idea is that our Budget will be presented next week.

        It seemed to me-and still does-that it is appropriate that we have an understanding about those outcomes with our accord partner, the ACTU. The fact that there is some criticism of the idea may well deter Senator Durack, but it does not deter me. I believe that at an appropriate time we will reach such an agreement and that will guarantee that when the recovery starts to strengthen in the latter part of this year it will create jobs and be able to sustain itself. That recovery will also mean that through an accord where we negotiate wages, taxes, the social wage and other aspects of an accord we will provide a living standards outcome for Australians and will not simply concentrate on the narrow element of wages, which are eroded by taxes. We will get an accord that will see us through and enable us to get moderate wage outcomes during the recovery period, and that will be a good thing for the Australian economy.

        There is very little evidence to show that the Burmese regime is considering ameliorating its policies in any way. The former leader of the NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi, has recently entered, as Senator Schacht said, her third year as a prisoner within her own home. More than 80 of the members of parliament elected in free elections only one year ago have been removed by death, arrest or detention or have felt obliged to flee the country for their own safety. Around 60 members of the NLD are currently in prison; at least three of them have recently had their prison sentences-originally of seven to 10 years' duration-arbitrarily increased by 10 years each.

       <para>
        A recent media report indicates that this year the regime might convene the National Convention composed of the remaining elected representatives-those who are not dead, in gaol, disqualified or out of the country-and representatives of so-called ethnic nationalities. The regime has said that it would draw up a new constitution. The regime has previously stated that it has refrained from convening this body on the grounds that the post-election procedures have not yet been finalised. We have been concerned that the regime's real purpose has been simply to ensure that all potential sources of opposition among the candidates for the National Convention are prevented from voicing their opinions.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the specific questions that I have been asked, reporting from our embassy confirms that the regime has amended the law under which many of Burma's political detainees are held to increase the maximum period from three to five years detention. That has, among other things, the effect of deferring releases which would otherwise have been due in the next two or three months. We will continue to consult other countries concerned about the situation in Burma, and we will certainly keep the question of economic sanctions under review. Regrettably, the indications we have had-both from my own direct discussions and from soundings taken in other countries-are that effective international sanctions are unlikely.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the UN resolution, it is not yet clear whether Sweden will be putting forward the same resolution as last year, but certainly we have been talking about and urging support for a resolution at this year's General Assembly and have indicated a willingness to co-sponsor that. It is on the agenda; it is just a question of shaping up an appropriate resolution.

       <para>
        As to the third question about the ASEAN response, in discussions with my colleagues at the ASEAN post-ministerial conference recently in Kuala Lumpur I raised the issue of Burma in both private meetings and formal sessions. On that occasion the ASEAN countries decided to designate the Philippines Foreign Minister, Raul Manglapus, as their spokesman on these issues on a visit he plans to make to Burma quite soon. This is an important new ASEAN initiative. Our embassy has been holding discussions with the Philippines authorities on the proposed visit. It is of particular value in the context of Burma having regard to and taking seriously the views of its trading partners and closest friends. For ASEAN to be prepared to raise these questions of international concern is an important new development.

        Finally, on the question of the release date for Aung San Suu Kyi, we have received no information on a possible release date for her. The orders for her continued detention have regularly been extended, most recently in July this year. She could now, under the recently amended terms of detention, be detained until mid-1994. The military authorities have let it be known that she could be released from detention but only if she first agreed to go into foreign exile. She has rejected this blatant attempt to remove her from the political scene and, in her determination to remain, has become a symbol of the Burmese people's aspirations for democratic change.

        The question posed by the Commission certainly does raise for public consideration and debate a whole series of arguments about wage fixation in the future. For example, in a recent policy statement the Confederation of Australian Industry announced that it thought that the Commission should be turned from a compulsory institution into a voluntary institution, only to be accessed when both parties to a dispute felt the need for it, and that national wage cases should cease. It posed the question: does the Confederation of Australian Industry want there to be a national wage case this year to set minimum wage standards for Australia or not?

       <para>
        I was interested to read in the newspaper this morning that the Director General of the CAI, Mr Brian Noakes, is quoted as saying-I imagine accurately-that the Confederation of Australian Industry would see an important and continuing role for the Commission while it is translating itself into whatever is the new wage framework for the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage I am considering what the Government's reply will be. The Government's policy direction is to manage the devolution of the centralised wage fixing system to more of a workplace focus than it has had in the past, and to embark on a course of encouraging workplace bargaining around achieving higher productivity outcomes so that prices for commodities can fall and returns to profits and wages can increase at the same time, as each of the three elements of productivity are shared between those in the community who have an entitlement to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are managing the very tricky and very difficult task of altering the centralised system that has served us so well until now to one with a productivity based enterprise focus. Our answer to that question will be about balancing the speed with which we meet that objective with the recognition of the needs of those people who are not in a position to bargain for productivity, or who are in a weak bargaining position and have a traditional bargaining relationship with their employers-not a common approach to the question of productivity, but an employer-employee relationship of the old conflict model. It is a matter of how we balance their needs to access wage increases at a time of economic stringency. When it is given, our reply will deal with an answer that sets out how to devolve the system and how to balance the needs of those people who will be left out in a workplace negotiating future.

         â€”Consumer credit insurance is extremely important for consumers in the marketplace in Australia. Obviously, it deals with that circumstance where, because of death, illness, unemployment or some accident, people are unable to keep up repayments in relation to credit that they have obtained to purchase a car, whitegoods, furnishings and so on. It is usually sold in conjunction with a finance package. That is the way that most Australians know of consumer credit insurance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The meeting of consumer affairs Ministers last Friday had before it a report from the Trade Practices Commission which I directed to be provided at about this time last year. The Commission undertook research into the promotion and the supply of consumer credit insurance and came to certain findings which validated the grave concerns, the misgivings, which were held by Ministers and members of the general community concerning this product.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amongst the problems highlighted by the Commission were, firstly, the fact that about one-quarter of those who obtained this form of insurance had no idea that they had purchased it-they were not even aware that they had purchased it as part of the package of getting the credit-and, secondly, it was found that at the worst end of the market commissions ranging between 30 per cent and 60 per cent of the premium were not uncommon. This creates a great incentive for those who sell this particular form of insurance to do so, regardless of the suitability for the consumer. Finally, there was a clear finding that on the whole consumers get back about 33c in the dollar from the premiums that are paid in relation to this form of insurance. That is considerably different from the general level of return to those who hold insurance. The general insurance industry as a whole has a loss ratio of between 78 per cent and 89 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ministers expressed concern at these findings by the Trade Practices Commission. Very authoritative, definitive research was done. They said that in relation to the loss ratios over the next three years they certainly want to see a better return to those who hold these sorts of insurance arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recommendations made in the report deal with disclosure so that consumers are aware that they are purchasing this form of insurance and the fact that the documentation ought to be written in very clear English and legible type. The Ministers also agreed that it is very important that there should perhaps be a 14-day cooling off period in relation to taking out this insurance. They have set a three-month discussion period for recommendations and for comment from the community in relation to those recommendations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would certainly like to thank the Trade Practices Commission, its officers and those consumer organisations which made representations and helped to carry out research for this very important document presented to consumer affairs Ministers. I believe that it will be very important in the marketplace as Australians deal with the fact that we are a credit ridden society; we need to obtain credit for everyday purchases and for the big purchases such as cars, whitegoods, furnishings and so on. In relation to that, whether one takes out insurance should be a matter of clear choice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under most fair trading Acts around the States, it cannot be made a condition of obtaining the credit. That should be very clearly understood by consumers. They should be wary of being forced into taking out such insurance. We are determined that consumers should know precisely what they are purchasing and that there should be restraints on the profit margins and certainly on the commissions that are charged in relation to this product.

It is certainly seen as a program for future policy adjustments that need to be made in their view.

        In the past we have focused on improving past performance as our standard.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to talk about raising Australia's industrial performance to best international standards. Yesterday I answered a question on the Australian Government's best practice program. The nine businessmen's 10-point plan focuses exactly on the purpose of our best practice program; that is, to lift, by international benchmarking, the performance of Australian industry to best international practice. Point eight states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Past labour relations have been characterised by conflict and low productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is an observation with which I agree. It was typified in the Fraser period of government in this country, but it is not so typical of our Government which has tried to focus industrial relations on the cooperative model, not the conflict model. Several things are then said, with which I agree, about the need for productivity negotiation. I answered that in some detail a moment ago. Point 10 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The nature and level of education and training in Australia is poor compared with many other countries with which we compete.
       </para>
       <para>
        It then talks about the need to improve the quality of our human resources. Point 10 continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        We strongly support the new attention being given to this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a comment on the education and training programs that this Government has introduced. The businessmen identify the urgent need to train managers for senior supervisory levels in the management of people. I concur with that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many elements of this 10-point plan are beneficial and useful. I have respect for each of the nine Australian businessmen who sponsored this plan. One of them is a person I know reasonably well, Mr Ian Burgess, the Chief Executive Officer of CSR. Therefore, in that context it is disappointing that I should read that CSR voted Mr Burgess, its Chief Executive Officer, a salary increase-from his current range of $460,000 to $470,000 to a new range of $610,000 to $620,000, an increase of 32 per cent. This is at a time when the aggregate wage outcome for the year is 6 1/4 per cent. Many workers will not get such an increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time as this occurred at the CSR annual general meeting, the report to shareholders was that the after-tax profit had fallen by 21 per cent. In this case, the 32 per cent salary increase could not be said to be based on performance but rather was based on so-called market factors. I am disappointed that, at a time when wages for ordinary wage and salary earners in Australia are moving at moderate levels-indeed, they have almost been in freeze for the last 14 months-and at a time when wage restraint is being practised massively by ordinary wage and salary earners, increases at the rate of 32 per cent still occur at the chief executive level. There is a need for the captains of industry to recognise that they should exercise the same restraint as the workers do.

It reportedly involves 25,000 tonnes of a total New Zealand import market of some 200,000 tonnes.

        I understand that New Zealand farmers are considering the possibility of a domestic countervailing complaint as a way of responding to this, if the sale is confirmed. I have no doubt also that the New Zealand Government will itself be concerned, if it is confirmed, because of the effect of such sale on the return to New Zealand's own wheat growers and because of the position that New Zealand has taken, along with the rest of us, in the Uruguay Round. The origins of all of this lie in what has been a longstanding practice, as I understand it, of Saudi Arabia paying its wheat farmers many times the international price to ensure national food security but then selling the surplus abroad at a major discount. This is not a new phenomenon; it has been around for a long time but the amounts have been relatively small.

Saudi Arabia is not a signatory to the GATT and therefore is not part of the Uruguay Round talks in agriculture trade. Nonetheless, in the interests of the global wheat market and trade liberalisation, we would be looking for Uruguay Round disciplines to be applied globally.

I refer to reports that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate has given up on getting life insurance and superannuation funds to contribute capital to the development fund he has been trying to establish. Further to the inconclusive response offered yesterday to a more general question on this issue, I ask the Minister: first, does he agree that Australian savings should be applied to the creation of jobs in Australia rather than off shore? Secondly, does he agree that the rise in Australia's foreign debt must be contained and, indeed, that the debt must be reduced? Thirdly, in this context would the Government give consideration-no more at this stage; just give consideration-to measures requiring superannuation funds to place a proportion of their funds into government guaranteed public utilities loans as a first step in addressing these issues?

He will have an opportunity to do that when Senator Button gets back this time next week. The Government generally is, of course, committed to maximising and ensuring the most efficient use of national savings. I do not think there would be too much disagreement with the general thrust of questions 1 and 2. As to the third part of Senator Spindler's question, the answer is no.

From his arrival in Dublin to August 1990 Mr Burke paid a 10 per cent flat rate as his contribution-as has been said in the question-for private telephone calls.

        In May this year it was established that a call logging facility was available for residential and chancellery telephones in Dublin from 1 January 1990. Itemised accounts were accordingly obtained by the mission and sent to Mr Burke. The company supplying the car phone had records from May 1990. Mr Burke checked the accounts thus made available to him and did identify personal international calls. The embassy administration has certified the accuracy of his statements in this respect.

        As a result of that further check of the specific itemised accounts, the amount owing was $7,724. As I have already said, that was offset against his final termination payment. That represents a final payment of his personal contribution to these accounts.

I did receive a report last night that the first mate of this vessel, the Sevilla Wave, has made allegations that the vessel discharged 13 tonnes of oil, several drums and oily rags outside Cleveland Bay on 8 August. State inspectors from the Queensland Department of Transport have interviewed the master and the chief engineer, and inspected the oil record book on the ship, but have found no evidence of any discharge recorded in that book; but, more importantly, Coastwatch aircraft overflew Cleveland Bay on 8 and 9 August and reported that there were no signs of any oil pollution.

        Officers are continuing to carry out the investigations, but at this stage it does not appear that there is any evidence of any actual pollution of oil. I understand that there has been some prominent coverage given to this story in north Queensland and in press reports in the Townsville media. We are treating the matter seriously, Mr President, and I will advise Senator Reynolds and the Senate if those continuing investigations turn up any evidence of actual oil pollution.

         â€”As I have advised the Senate on a number of occasions, only about 50 per cent, to put a figure on it, of the potential productivity improvements that need to be gained on the waterfront are gained on the waterfront itself. As the Inter-State Commission correctly pointed out, an equal amount of productivity is available through improvements in port performance and the very important area of the interface between the port and the land transport chain, whether it be by road or rail.

       <para>
        Yesterday the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure released an excellent and very important discussion paper on issues arising from its inquiry into the land transport interface with our sea ports. In July last year, in consultation with the Chairman of that Committee, I provided it with an extremely broad terms of reference which enabled it to have complete scope to identify the problems in terms of this interface and in making it more efficient.
       </para>
       <para>
        The discussion paper produced by the Committee yesterday follows a very extensive round of public hearings and inspections of ports earlier this year, and it provides a very comprehensive and clear outline of the various areas involved in the cargo handling chain. From this examination the Committee concludes that, while individual operations in ports are addressing the important question of their own efficiency, there is no overall coordination between all of the links in the chain. Consequently, improvement in waterfront efficiency not only has to involve each individual party in the process but also has to ensure that the links and interactions between other parties in the transport chain operate as efficiently as they possibly can.
       </para>
       <para>
        Going by the feedback I have been getting from the industry, the inquiry has benefited greatly from the very high regard in which the Chairman of this inquiry, Mr Peter Morris, is held by people in the transport industry. The discussion paper reflects the very considerable experience and expertise that Peter Morris brings to this task. The Committee is actively soliciting further submissions to its inquiry, which it hopes to bring to a conclusion by the end of this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I urge the reading of this discussion paper by all members of the Senate and anyone else who is interested in the area of waterfront reform. I urge anyone in the industry who wants to make further submissions to the inquiry to do so speedily.

Mr Brown expressed the view that there is a need to phase out penalty rates in the hospitality industry-comments which it was reported were made to support the Minister for Tourism, Mr Simmons, who has also indicated that penalty rates are detrimental to the hospitality industry. I ask the Minister: is the Government prepared to assist hospitality industry employers and employees in determining a more flexible wages system and if not, why not?

Accord mark 6 is about decentralising the centralised wage fixing system to make it more flexible and looks at how to achieve productivity at enterprise level. So if I heard the first part of his question correctly-are we interested in a more flexible wages system-the answer is that we are in the process of doing it.

       <para>
        The wages system is infinitely flexible. Indeed, if one does not wish to stick within the wages system as it is now structured, under section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act one can take a certified agreement, as it is called in the Act-that is, an agreement between the union and the employer at a particular establishment-and opt out of the system if that certified agreement is recognised by the Industrial Relations Commission as being bona fide and not an agreement based on exploitation by one party or the other. Effectively, we do have a flexible system and we are moving to make it even more flexible in the circumstances.

         â€” Penalty rates serve an important purpose. They pay people for working overtime and odd and peculiar hours, and for all sorts of other things. Senator Newman may not know this, but penalty rates are determinations that have been made by the Commission over the years as to what is an appropriate and fitting rate to pay for a particular disability as identified and found by the Commission.

        The bottom line here is always what the wages outcome will be. Within the context of maintaining a reasonable wage outcome, there is the possibility of any of the major players in the hospitality industry negotiating directly with their staff. Under section 115 of the Act, if they reach a certified agreement-as is the case with ICI at Botany-they may remove some of those penalty rates by agreement. Usually that occurs when there is some performance payment or some other sort of payment which acts as a substitute. To simplify the payment system and get a better level of remuneration for better productivity outcomes, an agreement of that nature is reached.

        It is possible to do such a thing in the hospitality industry. I do not agree that it should be done in isolation from anything else because that is simply negative. But if the hospitality industry directs itself to how productivity is improved, how to get a better team work approach in industry, how to break down the high turnover of staff and how to recognise the odd and peculiar hours worked, there is a possibility of getting wage outcomes by agreement through the existing Act in the present form.

         â€”Yesterday Senator Panizza asked me a question abouta possible inquiry into the activities of the CBA and other banks regarding foreign currency loans. I am in a position now to give him a response from the Treasurer which is in the following terms. The Government has no plans to hold an inquiry into the foreign currency lending activities undertaken by the CBA or otherbanks. The Martin parliamentary committee, the House of Representatives StandingCommittee on Finance and Public Administration, which is currently inquiring into the Australian banking industry, has taken evidence from both the Foreign Currency Borrowers Association and the banks, including the CBA, on this subject. The Committee is scheduled to report later this year and its findings may address past activities of the banks in this area. Dealings between the CBA and its customers are not a matter for the Government. They are, as I indicated yesterday, commercial-in-confidence matters, and disputes which cannot be settled between the parties are best left to the courts to resolve.

        â€”During the debate this morning on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, Senator Knowles made two claims: firstly, that I was guilty of breaching the Federal electoral law and, secondly, that I admitted having done so. Both claims are untrue, and maliciously untrue. The facts speak for themselves. In September 1990 Mr Justice Knight in the Federal Court of Appeal found that I was not guilty of a breach of section 315(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and, all along, for a period of nearly two and a half years, I had argued my innocence. In the eyes of the Australian system of justice, therefore, I am innocent. It is a pity that the independence of the judiciary and the validity of its findings are not acknowledged by some opposite. I repeat that both of Senator Knowles's claims are untrue and are, indeed, maliciously false, and the Senate earlier today was an involuntary and, I have no doubt, an unwitting witness to an exercise in McCarthyist smearing.

       <para>
        The Advance to the Minister for Finance for June is a very voluminous document. It was received in the Senate earlier today and it has not been possible to study fully all the items which go to make up the applications to the Advance for the Minister for Finance in June. On the examination I have been able to give it to date, there are some items which require the attention of the Senate. I will single out only two in view of the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, I draw the attention of the Senate to the enormous blow-out in the funds required in 1990-91 for payments for Austudy and Abstudy. The number of applications for Austudy in 1991 has been almost 50 per cent higher in terms of growth than the Budget estimates. I think my friend and colleague Senator Michael Baume will be commenting on that, and I assume he will comment on the blow-out in Abstudy. So I will not pursue it further, other than to make one of the points that I think he is going to make; namely, amongst other things, it is a considerable reflection of the massive deterioration in the state of the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I particularly draw attention to the final paper in this great bunch that has been submitted. It is an application through the Advance to the Minister for Finance for a payment of $2m for the purpose of meeting the undertaking given by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Premier of Queensland for infrastructure restoration following the recent natural disasters experienced by Queensland. I will seek leave to incorporate these papers after I have spoken to them, because I believe they are significant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Attached to that application in the papers to the Senate are three letters, the most important of which is a letter dated 8 May 1991 from the Prime Minister to the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, referring to the Prime Minister's letter dated 13 March 1991, almost two months earlier, to the Premier of Queensland, concerning Commonwealth assistance for infrastructure restoration following the recent natural disasters experienced by the State. In that letter, the Prime Minister says:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned that the processing of my commitment to Queensland has been unacceptably delayed because payments cannot be made from Financial Assistance Grants. Would you please therefore arrange payment of a capital grant to Queensland of $2 million in each of 1990-91 and 1991-92 for infrastructure restoration by way of an Advance to the Minister for Finance under the Treasury appropriation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I assert that that is a gross violation of every conceivable use that was ever intended for the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I believe that it is an illegal application and I believe that that money has been illegally paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from that letter there are two accompanying letters-a letter from Mr Keating to Mr Willis, because it is Mr Willis's job, as Minister for Finance, to approve payments under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, plus the Prime Minister's letter-which make it absolutely clear that the Prime Minister had no Cabinet approval, first of all, to make that commitment, so he entered into that commitment personally, on behalf of the Government. It appears that he received no further endorsement of that undertaking which he gave to the Premier.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the rules of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, applications are supposed to be made before payment is required. That was not done. It is an example of the enormous arrogance and presumption of the Prime Minister in playing with the money of the taxpayers of this country. It amounts to a virtual blackmail of the Treasurer. No wonder the former Treasurer is not getting on too well with the Prime Minister. I believe that this is an absolute disgrace and it needs to be investigated by the Auditor-General and all those concerned with the proper finances of this country. I seek leave to incorporate those letters in Hansard.

I particularly want to take up the question of an extra $52.7m being made available to Austudy. I am not complaining about the fact that Austudy, which is a demand driven payment, has gone up, because, after all, people are requiring Austudy assistance. What intrigues me is that it reinforces exactly the point I have been making in this Parliament over and over, and that is that Austudy and payments to Austudy are hiding the real extent of youth unemployment in this country. This submission admits that Austudy is being used for that purpose.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The documents reveal that the extra money-$52.7m-is required because, at the time of preparing the latest Budget, the Department had predicted a 9.5 per cent increase in beneficiaries. Then, based on figures available in January and February, these figures were revised upwards by a further 4 1/2 per cent at the Additional Estimates that we dealt with early in the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        It was assumed that the growth witnessed in the early months of 1991 was the result of improved marketing and earlier delivery of application forms.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is utter bunkum. We said in this Parliament that the reason for the increase was the massive surge in unemployment amongst young people. Austudy was being used by the Government as an escape hatch to hide the real number of young unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        It was predicted that the growth would taper off in April and May to give a total number of beneficiaries for the year of nearly 320,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the time, we said that was bunkum; we said that the figure would be far greater than that. The Additional Estimates included an extra $28.7m to cover the estimated cost of the increase. We now find out belatedly that the growth in beneficiary numbers was, however, sustained throughout April and May. It is now estimated that over 405,000 students will be placed on pay before the end of the financial year. That is 85,000 more than the estimate given when the Department asked for an additional $29m or so earlier this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is interesting because it is now conceded that basically the changed economic environment is one of the factors in this matter. How curious it is, as I pointed out yesterday, that something like 72,000 young Australians have disappeared out of the unemployment figures in a couple of months, yet 85,000 young Australians who were not budgeted for as recently as March or April this year are evidently being funded to stay at school or in tertiary institutions. These figures dramatically show what the disaster in the economy has brought to young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would extend this further because there is an item where $900,000 in urgent and unforeseen funding is required to assist unemployed people to set up self-employed ventures. That item states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Demand for New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) places is very strong and has increased substantially over previous years as a result of . . . effective Managing Agent structure--
       </para>
       <para>
        The real reason for the big increase is then admitted:
       </para>
       <para>
        The increased demand is also attributable to increases in the number and skill levels of unemployed people combined with a reduction in employment vacancies which make self employment often the only option for employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are seeing here in these Estimates figures the clear and direct result of the Government's recession that it says we had to have. We are seeing where multi- millions of dollars are being spent-not through the unemployment benefit-and in such a way as deliberately to hide the true level of unemployment and the huge costs of unemployment from not only the people involved but also the taxpayers, who are funding it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Frankly, the device used here is one that should be exposed. That is why I am speaking today: to reveal that these documents give a clear indication of the extent of the hidden unemployment in Australia. There are many other items, by the way, in this Advance to the Minister for Finance which are due and depend entirely on the level of recession, but none so blatantly hide the level of true unemployment as this $52.7m for Austudy.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”Mr Acting Deputy President, like Senators Short and Baume, I would also like to refer to the Advance to the Minister for Finance being used in what can only be described as an abnormal and unusual manner to pad out and pander to the Government's recession. In particular, I draw your attention to the allocation of some $4.32m through the Department of Employment, Education and Training portfolio for special employment, education and income support, specifically with regard to the Aboriginal study assistance scheme, colloquially known as Abstudy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This vote is, of course, vitally important to Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I would refer to Budget Paper No. 1 of last year and, in particular, to the description in that document where it was highlighted that the financial year would have a total Budget figure of some $92.7m for this particular allocation. What we now see at the eleventh hour, or the eleventh month of the year, is that there is a requirement that was not foreseen months earlier. The supporting documents have three special requests that were processed on closely linked dates in June in order to put this extra $4.3m through the books.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like Senator Baume, I am concerned about some of the reasons that have been advanced for this particular advance. Let me quote from one:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is thought that this increase in the take-up is due to wider economic circumstances in terms of a down-turn in the labour market resulting in a larger number of people seeking to enter full-time or part-time education and/or training.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before that, the paper outlines how DEET had been anticipating a growth in secondary beneficiaries of about 5 per cent, that there was similarly an anticipated growth in the beneficiary numbers of Abstudy of about 10 per cent, and that there had been a staggering 100 per cent increase in beneficiary numbers for tertiary part time allowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why was not that seen, prophesied and planned for at the time of the Supplementary Estimates earlier in the year? To have left it to the last month of the year either implies incompetence on the part of the Minister or departmental officers or, alternatively, that there has been such a deterioration in the national economy that Aboriginal people and students, many of whom live in isolated, remote communities of Australia, where the impact of the recession is very different, have been forced into the scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will pursue this matter; I put the Government on notice that for the forthcoming Budget Estimates I want to see the plans not just for the coming year and the changes in that particular vote item, but also details for the next three years. There needs to be long term planning for the remote, isolated and special communities-which are already in tragic circumstances and where much still needs to be done to improve Aboriginal education-to ensure that the votes and the financial underpinning of this program are not fiddled at the last minute because someone either got it wrong or deliberately planned an economy to have an adverse reaction on sectors of the community that just cannot afford to have hiccups in their major programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a major program that has important social, economic and personal consequences. It is one that I believe Senator Baume has highlighted in the general education area, particularly in relation to Austudy; however, this one highlights that it has even further and more tragic results for Aboriginal communities.

         â€”I too wish to refer to the payments made pursuant to the June Advance to the Minister for Finance. I would like to address a couple of remarks to the matter raised by my colleague Senator Short concerning the payment of $2m to Queensland, which purports to be for infrastructure payment for national disasters. I think it is particularly interesting to note that there is a specific allocation in the body of the Advance for June 1991 for further payment pursuant to the national disasters relief program, which draws upon the Advance to provide further money for disasters that have occurred in other States, but this one is deliberately set aside and not included in that amount. I think that perhaps highlights the fact that there may well be bureaucrats who are just as concerned about the use of this Advance to the Minister for Finance as we are.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also draw attention to the so-called reasons for it being asked; namely, it says that the application for funds meets the guidelines of the Advance for the Minister for Finance. I would seriously challenge that statement. It says that funds are required urgently, given the nature of the occurrence in the State. The only nature of the urgency seems to be that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) demanded that the payment be made. I do not think that in any way, shape or form meets the criterion set down. It is cited as `Unforeseen' because the requirement for the grant was unforeseen at the time of the preparation of the Budget Estimates and the Additional Estimates for 1990-91. That is quite obviously the case, but it is certainly not within the spirit of what the Advance is meant for. I put on notice that I will be most interested in pursuing this matter when we come to the Estimates hearings in order to find out just how that matter was treated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also wish to raise the question of the $31m sought by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce for payment to the Australian Trade Commission in respect of payments of national interest business. This matter particularly concerns me because when insurance is carried on the so-called national interest, that means EFIC, which is the insurance arm of Austrade and which is to be severed from it. That was to be effective from 1 September, but I now understand it is not to take place until November, despite the fact that a board has been appointed. The reason for the delay is that the legislation is yet to be settled. This is a most unsatisfactory way to do business. The fact is that when EFIC considers that an insurance is not a commercial insurance, such as insuring our trade of wheat to Iraq, it states that it will not carry the insurance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister of the day-and nobody else-makes a determination about whether the national interest will carry that risk and that simply means Consolidated Revenue. The Minister makes that decision; he may not delegate it. The Minister may take it to the Cabinet to have a Cabinet solidarity decision made if he wishes, but it is his responsibility. I want to know by what mechanism the payment is actually made. From the nature of this application I can only presume that a drawing is made from Consolidated Revenue and is then paid to EFIC to make the payment to people who have suffered the loss. I will make it my business to find out more particularly how that occurs, but I find the explanation given here-that the amount required for payment by way of insurance to the people who have suffered the loss-was erroneously understated. It says that the amount of $31m applies to the EMDGs and that the amount of $1.6m relates to EFIC. The reason for the EMDG blow-out of $31m is the erroneously understated amount; the reason for the blow-out in the EFIC payment is simply that there was a devaluation in the dollar. (Time expired)

         â€”I wish to speak briefly on the Advance to the Antarctic Division for lay-up costs for the Aurora Australis. No doubt, Mr Acting Deputy President, on your visits to Hobart you have noticed the large red vessel laid up beside the dock; it has been there for quite some time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have spoken about this matter before, but I would like to draw it to the attention of the Senate again because it is the first time in the history of Antarctic chartering that the taxpayer has had to pay for the lay-up costs of this vessel. Not only that, but, as I said earlier, the taxpayer is now also paying the cost of an ice pilot this year. Nevertheless, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) told us that this is all going to change. I wonder how much more it would cost if the vessel were not laid up in Hobart. Part of the agreement negotiated between the Government and the owners was the Government would pay the lay-up costs and it is just fortunate that the vessel was laid up in Hobart. Had it been laid up in Sydney, for instance, not only would the taxpayer have been up for the extra-and more expensive-lay-up costs there, but the taxpayer would also have had to pay the cost of getting the ship there and back.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I raised the question of lay-up costs earlier in the year, the Minister told me that it was expected that next year the Aurora Australis would have 40 days' alternative charter work with the Cooperative Research Centre in Hobart. I think that is great, but the Cooperative Research Centre in Hobart was promised $2.8m by Mr Hawke for research work on ice temperatures, marine research and so on, and the charter work at this time seems very convenient. When I raised a question of lay-up costs a couple of years ago in the context of the contract between the Government and the builders of the ship, I was told that during the lay-up period the Aurora Australis would be chartered out for private work and thus that would negate the cost to the Government of the lay-up. That was fine at the time, but as we see from this, the Government obviously could not find any work for the ship this year. The Minister has told us that over the next seven years there will be work for the ship, but the taxpayer will pay for that. So whether the Aurora Australis sits at a wharf in Hobart or is doing some charter work for the Cooperative Research Centre, the taxpayer will have to pay the extra money.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that it has been very convenient that charter work for the Aurora Australis over the next couple of years was found by the Government because it puts paid to the Minister's statements at earlier times. In fact, the Minister's statements were just a lot of hot air as far as I am concerned. The extra money that is to be provided by the taxpayer for work for the Aurora Australis is just to get egg off the Government's face.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I am on that subject I raise the question again: who is the owner of Aurora Australis? The Minister will not answer. I have put questions on notice. He will not tell me who the owner of Aurora Australis is. He will not even tell me the name of the company on the list of non-statutory bodies that Senator Coates managed eventually to get for the Parliament. It is Antarctic Shipping Pty Ltd. As I said, who is the owner of Aurora Australis? Is it P &amp;O Polar or is it Antarctic Shipping Pty Ltd? We know that Antarctic Shipping Pty Ltd is a $2 company. All its shares are held by the Commonwealth of Australia through the Commonwealth Bank. I believe that it is the owner of the ship.
       </para>
       <para>
        My time is about to expire so I will not be able to pursue this matter any further now. But I certainly will be pursuing the matter to find out the story behind this because we know that P &amp;O receives favourable treatment from the Government. If the Government is paying for the ownership of the ship, a lot of questions need to be answered.

         â€”I want to speak briefly to the Advance to the Minister for Finance of June 1991 as it relates to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs-an additional allocation of $1.5m, bringing the total amount to $2,081,000 for the year ended 30 June 1991.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This clearly relates to the cost of administering the Department and the cost of housing and looking after a number of refugees, in particular the Cambodian refugees housed in Darwin. In May the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations visited Darwin and looked at the situation applying to the number of refugees who were being held in security pending a determination of their application for refugee status. We have been apprised of the fact that in many instances these people had been on Australian soil for almost 12 months but at that time no application had been submitted to the Department for consideration. In the meantime, the taxpayer of Australia is picking up a very substantial tab of $2m, of which $1.5m is for additional allocations included in the Advances referred to in the Government documents tabled in the Senate today.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is inappropriate, reprehensible and totally inefficient for the Minister and his Department not to ensure that those people had their applications processed in a shorter period than 12 months. I am talking not only from a practical point of view and a cost point of view as far as the taxpayers of Australia are concerned-that is what we are talking about; the bottom line is that the taxpayers pick up the Bill-but also from a humanitarian point of view. These people are in secure accommodation. We are feeding them, clothing them and attempting to give them some basic education. But the point is that we are not meeting what I believe are our humanitarian responsibilities, let alone what we ought to be doing from an efficiency point of view in the expenditure of taxpayers' funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that a number of refugees have now submitted their applications. When we were in Darwin in May, 10 of those people had had only preliminary interviews with departmental officers. It is simply not good enough when millions of dollars are expended because of lack of efficiency within the Department in processing applications such as that. If they are to be returned eventually, the longer they stay on Australian soil the more difficult it is from their point of view as individuals to return home, if that is the bottom line or the determination is such that they have to go home in due course because they do not qualify for refugee status. In the meantime, we have spent millions of dollars looking after them as a result of lack of efficiency within the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me take the matter one step further. The new Migration Act introduced by Senator Robert Ray several years ago has been an unmitigated disaster. Officers of the Department find it confusing and cannot give clear, concise advice to people seeking it; neither can people recommend a course of action to individuals as to the course they ought to follow-the type of application they ought to submit, what their rights are, and the requirements of the Act. Over this period we have seen new regulations and amendment after amendment. We get a new batch of regulations every couple of weeks, trying to plug another hole that has been identified by the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that the Migration Act is failing, and failing badly. It does not give clear, concise guidelines upon which people can make a determination and upon which advice can be given to people in what in many instances is a very emotively based set of circumstances. In some instances these people go through trauma while applying for permanent residency in Australia. Therefore, I think it is incumbent upon the Government, recognising the cost that is flowing through to the taxpayers, to look at that Migration Act, to acknowledge that it is not working efficiently and well, and to recognise that it is an unmitigated disaster and that the Government is compounding the problem by the regulations it keeps bringing in week after week, to the point, I understand, that we will not get a rewrite of the Migration Act incorporating the regulations brought in over the last 12 months for at least another year.

        </para>
        <para>
         I see that Senator MacGibbon wishes to speak to this paper, so I will be very brief. This Auditor-General's report is very important because it points to some needs to make significant changes to matters relating to prohibited goods and the search, basically, for drugs. There is no doubt in my mind that the need to improve the arrangements outlined by the Auditor-General must be taken up by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, even though there is evidence that the Australian Customs Service is reluctant to undertake some of the measures recommended by the Auditor-General.
        </para>
        <para>
         In particular, the Auditor-General points to the need for Customs to obtain suitable premises in Sydney and Brisbane for the conduct of discrete examination of containers for prohibited goods. I imagine that Senator MacGibbon will be dealing with that matter, so I will not go into it at great length, other than to say that in 1982 under the Fraser Government some legislation providing adequate security requirements was passed but relevant amendments to the legislation were not proclaimed because Customs said that it would impose unreasonable burdens on people using it and that therefore they were not appropriate.
        </para>
        <para>
         However, the Auditor-General remains concerned about the potential for any reduction in the standard of security at any stage in the clearance of containerised sea cargoes, and it considers the development of national security standards for licensed premises to be an appropriate course of action. It considers that covert cargo examinations should be undertaken in an environment which ensures secrecy so that the effectiveness of drug detection efforts are not compromised. That is not the situation which presently exists. The Auditor-General has recommended that a 24-hour surveillance operation be set up while these changes are being made and the Customs Service has said that it is not considered appropriate. I believe that action should be taken about that.
        </para>
        <para>
         One other matter I want to raise briefly is the drug dog detection unit, the DDDU. I think that everyone is aware, from a lot of publicity, of how effective that unit has been. However, the Audit Office found that in Sydney there had been a very high incidence of illness amongst the dogs as a result of an inadequate standard of accommodation, thus reducing the overall effectiveness of the unit. It seems to me to be appalling that the Customs Service did not get its act in order well enough to make certain that this important element of the fight against drugs-the dogs-was properly looked after.

         I note that Customs advised that it had been aware of this problem and that the health of dogs is now of a desirable standard and accommodation has improved. Quite frankly, it is all very well to have that assurance, but maybe the Auditor- General should make certain that the accommodation for those animals has improved. It would be an enormous waste of resources if that was still the situation. I hope that it was not only the Auditor-General's complaints that prompted Customs to smarten itself up on this issue. If it was, I think that the organisation should quite properly be criticised.
        </para>
        <para>
         Another matter raised by the Auditor-General was that dogs were not available for approximately 20 per cent of the examinations for which they were requested, apparently because of training commitments for dogs and handlers. That seems to be an extraordinary situation. I see that Customs responded by saying that it was aware of the need to increase the number of operational dog teams and it planned to have 45 teams operating by mid-1991, which is an increase of almost 50 per cent. I welcome that. It is no doubt unfortunate that it seems that it had to depend on an Audit Office recommendation that priority be given to improving the standard of accommodation for the dog unit before it happened.

          â€”The Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 1 relating to the Australian Customs Service is before the Senate. I wish to speak briefly on it. Audit reports are simply a sampling of one or two-or half a dozen-operations of a large department. In this survey Customs came out without criticism on a number of elements that were examined and, as my colleague Senator Michael Baume said, came in for some criticism on others.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         I would like to comment briefly on the containerised inspection techniques. Most of the cargo coming into Australia by sea now comes in in containers. They are quite large. They are very robust. They are of heavy steel construction with a door at one end. Despite their massive structural integrity, the weakness is in the lock. It is very easy to break into a container because they usually only have a simple padlock or a simple sealing device on them. It is important that security is maintained on containers before they are released by Customs because they are relatively easily broken into. That requires a secure area for them to be stored in.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Customs Service goes through a percentage of those containers to make sure that they do contain what the manifest says they contain. In most cases it is a very big job to go through a 40-foot container-I forget the number of man days of operation that are involved. The amount of time involved in going through a container full of golf balls which are packed six to a cellophane pack, a dozen packs to a box and a dozen boxes to a carton in detail is quite mind-boggling.
        </para>
        <para>
         Nevertheless, I do agree with the audit report that there is a case for a secure area out of sight where containers can be gone through, if only for the convenience of the Customs officers who have to work in all weather. It should be a reasonable expectation that they can do that safe from prying eyes at a distance seeing what containers they are going through. It often happens-particularly where drugs are concerned-that their presence will be established and they will be left so that the recipients of the drugs can be apprehended at the final point of their distribution.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is also some criticism of the contraband enforcement teams from an administrative point of view, with suggestions as to how that, and methods of control of mail coming in, could be improved.
        </para>
        <para>
         The fundamental point is that Customs cannot do any more than it has resources for. It is important that Customs is supported financially. If it does not have enough resources, the Commonwealth suffers a loss of revenue in that goods on which duty should be paid enter the country duty free, and that is a loss to the Treasury.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Customs Service is also important from a surveillance point of view. While the quarantine provisions are primarily a matter of health, Customs is often the first point of detection of illegal foodstuffs and foodstuffs which might carry parasites which pose great potential risk to the Australian primary industries.
        </para>
        <para>
         Then there is the matter of contraband itself. It is generally accepted that, while personal couriers with drugs concealed on their bodies form a significant vehicle through which contraband or illicit drugs enter Australia, the great majority of drugs come in through containers. Given the hundreds of thousands of containers that come into this country each year, checking them out is a major job. It all leads to resources, and that leads to money in the budget and having the detection techniques and the officers to do that. In my experience with Customs, it really is a conscientious and capable organisation. It is well led and well motivated, but it can only do what the resources at its disposal will allow it to do.
        </para>
        <para>
         Last week, when I was in the Cape York and Torres Strait Island area, I had the opportunity to meet with senior Customs officers in Cairns and the Torres Strait region and talk to them about their problems. I was very satisfied with the level of professional competence that they showed and their interest in and dedication to their jobs. However, that Torres Strait area is becoming an area of increasing relevance in illegal trafficking of goods and human bodies-illegal migrants. The Customs Service is the primary barrier against that in the region.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is an area characterised by quite short distances internationally. It is probably not much more than 120 miles from Cape York to the New Guinea border just beyond Boigu Island and Saibai Island. There are numerous islands in the area, giving a dispersed population-a population which, nevertheless, has quite strong family and community links within it so that it knows who is moving through the area.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is an area of very great mobility. The standard means of transport is a 14-foot aluminium dinghy with a 40 horsepower motor. Anyone in those dinghies-there are hundreds of them in the area-moves without comment and without notice in any way at all. It is very easy for people to island hop from the New Guinea border to Cape York, or even bypass the islands altogether and move from the New Guinea mainland into Australia. When we talked to the community leaders-the equivalent of shire chairmen-in the four or five regions in Torres Strait, they told us that this year they were increasingly aware of and increasingly concerned about illegal traffic in the region. I think that, although the evidence is anecdotal, they have grounds for their concern.
        </para>
        <para>
         In looking at this audit report, it is quite proper for me to comment on the need for increased resources for Customs in that area. We are not talking about a huge increase in resources, but clearly something that increased the surveillance techniques, and the ability to have personnel on the ground talking to the communities around the island groups and on Cape York itself, would be very much in the national interest. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         The Senate is considering the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 2 of 1991-92-Project Audit-Australian National University-Housing Operations. The Australian National University maintains a stock of 575 dwellings for renting to accredited visitors, postgraduate research scholars and full time undergraduate students. The current value of the housing stock is $51m, and in the last calendar year the net operating surplus from this investment was $302,703.

          â€”Yes. This is somewhat alarming because viewed as a return on capital it represents only 0.53 per cent. Even when the non-operating revenue is included, the surplus amounts to a little under a million dollars, which is a return on capital of 1.7 per cent. Given the value of the asset, this is obviously a very small return. Some of the reasons for this are quickly apparent in the `Key Findings' at the beginning of the report.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The project audit raises a number of queries: the appropriateness of the current level of investment in housing stock and alternative uses for the funds committed; the condition of the housing stock and the required maintenance levels; the unsatisfactory financial performance of the operation; and the low level of rents which are below market rates.
        </para>
        <para>
         The original objective of the housing operation was to induce suitable academic staff to join the university back in the 1950s. The inducement was thought necessary in 1950 because the university was new and Canberra was a small country town. At that time Cabinet approved the building of 99 units. This is an excellent example of what happens with a bureaucracy when it is unchecked. It is fortunate to see that the Auditor-General is bringing it into check at this point, because the city has expanded and it is a very attractive place to live. The university also now has a world reputation. One would ask: why are these sorts of things continuing in 1991?
        </para>
        <para>
         The audit notes that in March 1991 there was an aggregate weekly difference of $756 between market rents and rents being charged by the university's office. On an annual basis the weekly difference extends to $39,312 per annum. The Australian National Audit Office considers that setting rents below market rates may be illegal as well as bad management. It has recommended to the Australian National University that all rents be increased to market levels as soon as possible. The Australian National University has apparently agreed to this recommendation and appropriate action is being considered.
        </para>
        <para>
         Apart from the fact that we have a very valuable resource which is being wasted and a loss of potential revenue to the Australian National University, this is an excellent case for privatisation. Because the Australian National University does not have to subsist on the return of these assets, there is no bottom line, there is no emphasis on making a reasonable return on capital and the institution is losing income which could be ploughed back into supporting the basic functions of the university.
        </para>
        <para>
         One has to ask a number of questions. How long has this been going on? Presumably since that Cabinet decision in 1950, which means it has taken 40 years for this matter to now be brought before the public. If there had not been this report by the Auditor-General how much longer would it have taken to come to our attention? How much money has the ANU lost through the financial mismanagement of its housing operation? Why has it devoted so much of its resources to this activity?
        </para>
        <para>
         There are 577 houses and 18 staff to run them. That is 32 dwellings to one supervising staff member instead of 90 to one staff member, which is usual in housing operations. If the Auditor-General had not acted and produced this report and we in the Senate had not had the opportunity to examine the report, how long would it have taken the university to introduce reforms in this matter?

          â€”I support the motion that the Senate take note of Audit Report No. 2 1991-92 Project Audit-Australian National University-Housing Operations. My concerns do not parallel those held by Senator Tierney. There is little hint in the report of the sorts of concerns that the report could well encourage the Australian National University to explore.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         Senator Tierney rightly points out that the original intention of the housing operation, which is repeated in the report, was to provide an inducement for suitable academic staff to join the university. He rightly observes that the nature of the small town character of Canberra has altered since the introduction of this scheme in 1950. The report tells us on page 3:
        </para>
        <para>
         The present policy is to offer accommodation for continuing staff who require temporary accommodation, for approved visiting staff, non-continuing staff and postgraduate students. There is also a program to offer a limited amount of accommodation off campus for undergraduate students to supplement that available on campus.
        </para>
        <para>
         It seems that the original intention has been altered somewhat. It would be reasonable to assume that that has altered in response to the unique demand for housing at the Australian National University. Because it is our Australian National University its housing requirements for its students and staff are unique due to the very nature of its program.
        </para>
        <para>
         This aspect requires further emphasis and exploration by both the university and the Government. The opportunity of equity of access to our national university is dependent upon not only the entrance opportunity that all Australian students have but also the opportunity for those students to be accommodated within Canberra or the university's precincts. That accommodation opportunity is reduced somewhat if we do not have this unique housing operation which presently exists. On page 4 the report tells us:
        </para>
        <para>
         Short term accommodation services on this scale generally do not exist in Australian universities.
        </para>
        <para>
         That emphasises the unique nature of those services. The unique charter to serve as a national university, on its own, justifies the provision of a short term housing option so that those students who come from further away in Australia have an equitable housing opportunity. This operation, with its admitted emphasis on provision for staff and postgraduates, may not necessarily meet the sort of demand that I am speaking of. Even in the housing operation strategic plan of 1989 to 1993, which is quoted again in this report, there is an emphasis on staff and the staffing philosophy.
        </para>
        <para>
         In response to this report, I am suggesting that further attention could be given to the unique nature of the Australian National University and its charter and the reduced opportunity which students throughout Australia would have in attending that university if there was a reduction in accommodation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let us look at equity of access. The accommodation arrangements which have to be made by students before the beginning of an academic year-whether they come from somewhere close by, somewhere else in New South Wales or somewhere very different, such as from Western Australia or perhaps the wilds of Tasmania-quite rightly, are noted in this report. Page 4 of the report reads:
        </para>
        <para>
         Of particular value to both the University and the visitor is that time is not wasted in searching for housing prior to taking up an academic appointment or study place.
        </para>
        <para>
         I suggest that those who are mostly concerned with studying are less interested in spending time looking for accommodation. That is also recognised. It is reported that the demand is of a cyclical nature. When one person is looking for housing at the beginning of the academic year, several hundred others are also looking and so it very much becomes a seller's market.
        </para>
        <para>
         These are the sorts of things which would discourage one from supporting the idea of privatisation advanced by Senator Tierney. Privatisation might be satisfactory if private enterprise could guarantee, without taking advantage of those seeking accommodation, to meet both the cyclical nature and the particular cultural requirements which may be placed upon the housing market by people attending our national university from overseas. There is a particularly important skew in that direction where people who are experienced in dealing with clients, students or staff from overseas would know the sorts of special considerations that need to be given. Within this housing operation those people have developed those particular skills.
        </para>
        <para>
         I suggest that the evaluation brought to this operation by Senator Tierney, which used as its main criterion the return on capital, is not the only method of judging the success of the housing operation of the Australian National University. Many other criteria could be brought to that examination which could be of even greater importance than a simple return on capital because it is not always money which drives this operation. The audit report, quite accurately, brings to our attention that money is not the only criterion which should be brought to judge this operation.

        CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to reform Australia's marine cargo liability legislation which is concerned with legal responsibility for loss or damage occurring to sea-borne cargo.
       </para>
       <para>
        This new Bill replaces the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1990 which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 12 September 1990, following a review of Australia's marine cargo liability regime.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1990 Bill resulted in a number of representations being received from shippers, ocean carriers and the legal profession expressing concern about certain technical aspects of the proposed legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        These concerns focused on the use of modern language instead of the original texts of international conventions, the need to clarify the Bill's application to contracts of carriage other than those evidenced by documents of title such as bills of lading, and the scope of coverage of Australian Law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The complex legal issues raised by these representations were addressed in consultations between Commonwealth officials and the parties concerned. The revised provisions of the replacement Bill, which I will detail later, satisfactorily resolve those issues and there is broad industry support for the approach now adopted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's current marine cargo liability regime is embodied in the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1991 will repeal that Act. However, a ``savings clause'' will allow the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924 to continue to operate in relation to contracts of carriage entered into prior to the commencement of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The objectives of the Bill are to provide Australia with a marine cargo liability regime that
       </para>
       <para>
        * is up-to-date, equitable and efficient;
       </para>
       <para>
        * is compatible with arrangements adopted by our major trading partners;
       </para>
       <para>
        * and takes account of developments in this area within the United Nations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924 is based on the 1924 International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading-commonly known as the Hague Rules. It is the basis of marine cargo liability regimes generally included in national legislation in force in the world today. The main thrust of the Hague Rules is to limit the extent to which shipowners are liable for loss or damage to cargo while it is in their keeping. The relevant circumstances of such liability are defined in the Rules and an upper monetary limit is imposed on any claims made by cargo owners or shippers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hague Rules have been amended by two international protocols-the Visby Protocol of 1968, and the SDR (Special Drawing Right) Protocol of 1979. These protocols update the Hague Rules by increasing the liability limit for shipowners, replacing the gold standard with the international monetary fund's modern currency unit-the Special Drawing Right-and redefining the term ``package or unit'' of cargo to take account of the modern use of containers in shipping.
       </para>
       <para>
        These two protocols are gaining acceptance among maritime trading nations and this Bill provides for their incorporation into Australian law. Schedule 1 to the Bill sets out the provisions of the Hague Rules as amended by the Visby and SDR Protocols. Australia will also formally accede to these two protocols.
       </para>
       <para>
        Shippers have argued that a deficiency of the Hague Rules, which these protocols do not substantially alter, is that shippers bear the major burden of risk for loss or damage to sea-borne cargo, even though the shipowner has care of the cargo. As a result, shippers generally have to make separate arrangements to fully insure their cargo against this risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        This criticism is addressed in the 1978 United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, commonly known as the Hamburg Rules. The main feature of the Hamburg Rules is the transfer of much of the burden of liability from shipper to shipowner during the time that the shipowner has care of the cargo.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hamburg Rules have not yet come into force internationally as only 19 of the requisite 20 signatories have acceded to it. In addition, few of the signatories to the Convention are significant maritime trading nations and so far none of Australia's major trading partners have acceded.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, the Government does recognise the argument of the greater equity of the Hamburg Rules and the potential benefits for shippers that may accrue from a general international acceptance of the Hamburg Rules. Australia remains essentially a shipper nation and the Bill provides for the eventual replacement of the Hague/Visby/SDR regime with the Hamburg Rules. The text of the Hamburg Rules is set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The inclusion of the Hamburg Rules in the Bill is a signal that Australia intends to accept this Convention when its international standing is such that it can demonstrably provide a viable basis for new cargo liability arrangements for international seaborne trade between Australia and its trading partners.
       </para>
       <para>
        As long as the Hamburg Rules have not come into force internationally it is inappropriate to seek proclamation of the parts of the Bill that deal with the implementation of this Convention. The decision to bring the Hamburg Rules into effect for Australia will be made by the Government of the day in the light of demonstrated international acceptance of this Convention, particularly by Australia's major trading partners, and by any further developments in the United Nations in relation to marine cargo liability arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1990 Bill sought to reproduce the texts of the amended Hague Rules and the Hamburg Rules in a modernised ``plain English'' version. However, concern was expressed that the changes, though only intended to be stylistic, could inadvertently change the meaning of the Rules as established by the extensive interpretation of courts internationally. In order to avoid possible increased litigation under the amended versions it was decided to retain the internationally accepted texts.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the Hague Rules, there is no official English translation of the original French version of the Convention agreed to in 1924. It was decided after extensive consultation to use the Australian Treaty Series translation of the Hague Rules as the basis for Schedule 1 of the Bill, as this is the version most commonly used in the English speaking world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coverage of the Bill also extends, on a voluntary basis, to contracts of carriage evidenced by non-negotiable transport documents. These non-negotiable transport documents fulfil similar functions to bills of lading (that is, they are evidence of the contract of carriage of the goods between the carrier and the shipper), with the exception that they do not convey title to the cargo. The extension of the Bill's coverage in this regard recognises the increasing use of non-negotiable transport documents in Australia's interstate and international sea trades and resolves the question as to whether the Hague/Visby/SDR regime can be applied where such documents are used.
       </para>
       <para>
        A provision has been included in the Bill along the lines of sections 9(1) and (2) of the existing Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924 which applies Australian law to the resolution of liability disputes arising from the sea carriage of goods in our export trades. This avoids the potential delays, increased costs and language difficulties which may be involved with the resolution of disputes under foreign laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        A provision has also been included to preserve the effect of the jurisdiction and arbitration articles of the Hamburg Rules which permit the complainant to choose under which jurisdiction disputes are arbitrated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rather than producing an amending Bill which would require users to make continuous reference to the 1990 Bill it was decided that it would be better to have a self-standing Bill which incorporated all the agreed amendments. For this reason it was decided that the existing Bill will be withdrawn from the House of Representatives at the earliest opportunity and replaced with the Bill being introduced today-The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides for a minor consequential amendment to the International Arbitration Act 1974. This amendment will ensure that the International Arbitration Act will not override the Australian law and jurisdiction provisions of the Bill. This is consistent with the current approach under the International Arbitration Act which contains a restriction which ensures that it does not affect the operation and jurisdiction provisions contained in section 9 of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill does not affect the operation of the relevant parts of the Navigation Act 1912 which deal with the carriage of dangerous cargoes and which preserve the protection that shipowners enjoy from liability in respect of fire damage and theft of valuables in certain circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also does not affect the operation of the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989 which gives the force of law in Australia to the Convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims. This means that shipowners can limit their total liability from all claims of a certain nature arising on any distinct occasion including claims of loss of life or personal injury, or loss of or damage to property occurring on board or in direct connection with the operation of the ship.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill prevails over the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to the extent of any inconsistency. This will remove the potential for action to be taken against an ocean carrier under the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act in respect of loss or damage to cargo by a shipper who is not normally in the business of cargo shipping.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the legislation being proposed makes no specific calls on the revenues of the Commonwealth. There is no Government administrative involvement in the operation of the Bill's provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend this Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

       <para>
        CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill proposes amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 to provide police officers with powers to search aircraft, vehicles or vessels in emergency situations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth legislation currently confers emergency search powers on a wide range of officials, including police, in relation to offences against specific enactments. However, no such powers are conferred on the police in relation to the vast majority of Commonwealth offences. This is despite the fact that the Australian Federal Police is the Commonwealth's primary law enforcement agency.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the past the Australian Federal Police relied on emergency search powers conferred in State and Territory laws and applied by section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act. A recent court decision in South Australia indicated that State law could not be applied in this way because section 10 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act covers the field. Section 10, however, provides for searches authorised by warrant only.
       </para>
       <para>
        I appreciate that there will always be concern in some quarters about providing police with additional powers. In this case we are giving the police powers which they have always been able to exercise in the past and which are common to police forces in other jurisdictions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment is designed to provide a clear basis for police action in emergency situations across the various jurisdictions in relation Commonwealth and Territory offences.
       </para>
       <para>
        The powers proposed are limited. It is proposed that emergency search powers should only apply in public places or in some other place to which members of the public have ready access.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, a police officer will only be able to stop, detain and search a conveyance in public places if he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that:
       </para>
       <para>
        * an item relevant to an indictable offence is in or on the conveyance;
       </para>
       <para>
        * it is necessary to stop, detain and search the conveyance to prevent the thing from being concealed, lost or destroyed; and
       </para>
       <para>
        * the circumstances are so serious and urgent that it is necessary to exercise this power without obtaining the authority of a search warrant.
       </para>
       <para>
        When conducting the search, the officer may only use such assistance as is necessary and must not detain the conveyance for longer than necessary. The officer may also use force if necessary, but must not force open parts of the conveyance or receptacles found during the course of the search without first giving the person in charge of the conveyance the opportunity to open them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, once an item has been seized, further safeguards come into play. Police officers may only retain items for 60 days after their seizure. At the end of this period they must either take steps to return the thing to the person from whom it was seized or to its owner, unless the thing is required for evidence, is subject to a further order allowing the officer to retain it or the officer is otherwise authorised by law to retain, dispose or destroy of the thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such powers are essential for the effective operation of the Australian Federal Police, particularly in their investigations concerning drug offences. The movement of narcotics is essential to their effective marketing and provides an opportunity for detection and interdiction by an appropriately empowered investigating force. Other offences, particularly those involving the use of firearms or explosives often call for the exercise of emergency search powers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Bill provides effective powers for police to protect our society and enforce its laws without unduly infringing upon the privacy and freedom of movement of individuals.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.

        CRIMES (AVIATION) BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        The Crimes (Aviation) Bill 1991 consolidates the provisions of the 4 Acts forming the current aviation crimes legislative package. Three of these Acts, that is, the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972, the Civil Aviation (Offenders on International Aircraft) Act 1970, and the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 implement international conventions to which the Commonwealth is a party. Those Conventions are incorporated in 4 schedules to the Bill. The fourth Act, the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, is domestic oriented legislation governing the law applying on board certain aircraft and prescribing offences in relation to aircraft. All four of these Acts are repealed by the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the exception of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, the Acts have been enacted on a convention by convention basis so that four specialised Acts cover different aspects of crimes, all involving aircraft. This consolidation has allowed the provisions of all 4 Acts to be reviewed. As a result the jurisdictional and procedural requirements have been rationalised and law applying in relation to crimes involving aircraft has been vastly simplified. All aircraft over which the Commonwealth has jurisdiction are covered by the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill contains no new offences, but simply re-enacts offences in the existing Acts. These offences, created in Part 2 of the Bill, relate to aircraft, aerodromes, airports and air navigation facilities. In the light of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 the requirements in the existing Acts that the Attorney-General, or a person authorised by the Attorney-General, consent to each prosecution has not been re-enacted.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conjunction with the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Bill ensures that a person who commits an act before its commencement may be prosecuted under the current aviation crimes legislative package to which I have referred. While preserving the effect of State and Territory laws, the Bill ensures that no person may be punished under separate legal regimes for the same conduct, that is, double jeopardy is prohibited.
       </para>
       <para>
        The traditional, and necessary, authority of the aircraft commander in relation to acts done on board an aircraft is preserved. Where the commander of an aircraft suspects a person of committing an offence, or believes it is necessary in order to prevent the commission of an offence, the commander may disembark that person and have him or her dealt with under provisions of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a consolidation, the Bill involves no additional direct costs to the Commonwealth. Rather, the Bill should reduce costs by simplifying the administration of this area of the Commonwealth's criminal law.

        FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 will make a large number of amendments to improve the operation and administration of the Freedom of Information Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable Senators will be aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs carried out a review of the operation of the FOI Act. In December 1987 the Committee published a report recommending a large number of legislative amendments and changes in administrative practice.The Committee reported that there is widespread support for the objectives of the FOI Act which are to make available to the public information in the possession of the Commonwealth Government, to increase Government accountability and to increase public participation in the process of government. It found that the FOI Act has brought benefits to individuals, government agencies and the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para>
        However the Committee also leaned to the view that it is appropriate to pay greater attention to the costs of FOI, particularly in tight economic and budgetary circumstances. Many of the Committee's recommendations focused on ways of improving the operation and administration of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's response to that Report was tabled in June 1989. Although some recommendations could not be accepted because of the cost of their implementation, the Government agreed to the implementation of a majority of the Committee's proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1991 will introduce the necessary amendments to implement the legislative changes agreed to by the Government. The Bill will also make a small number of technical changes to the Act in areas which have, subsequent to the Committee's Report, come to notice as requiring correction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The majority of provisions in the Bill are aimed at simplifying the processing of requests by government agencies. The procedure for making a request for access to the documents of an agency is being streamlined. The steps which agencies must follow in imposing charges for access are being simplified. Improvements are being made to the procedures for consultation with business, State and Territory governments and private individuals about the disclosure of documents which affect their interests. Provisions relating to review of agency decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are being clarified.In accordance with the Senate Committee's recommendations, section 24 of the Act is being amended to allow agencies greater scope to refuse to deal with requests which substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of an agency from its other responsibilities. At the same time the Bill strengthens the provision in section 24 requiring agencies to consult with applicants before refusing requests on workload grounds. Section 24 will place the onus on agencies to give applicants practical help to narrow the terms of their requests to manageable proportions.
       </para>
       <para>
        With one exception the Bill is not making significant changes to the provisions of the FOI Act which allow government agencies to exempt documents or parts of documents from public disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The one exception is in relation to secrecy provisions in Commonwealth legislation. At present the FOI Act provides that a document is exempt from public disclosure if there is a secrecy provision in a Commonwealth Act prohibiting the disclosure of information of the kind contained in the document. Federal Court interpretation has limited the exemption to specific secrecy provisions but the exemption remains uncertain in its operation. The Senate Committee recommended that a list of relevant secrecy provisions be included in a schedule to the FOI Act but did not suggest any criteria upon the schedule should be drawn up.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill introduces a schedule of secrecy provisions into the Act. In general three criteria have been used in determining whether a secrecy provision should be included in the schedule.
       </para>
       <para>
        First the provision must be specific in identifying a category of information which the Parliament has determined should be subject to a blanket prohibition on public disclosure. If too many broad secrecy provisions are included in the schedule, the general right of public access to documents created by the FOI Act would be undermined. Second it will generally be inappropriate to include a secrecy provision in the schedule if the specific exemption provisions in Part IV of the FOI Act already provide adequate protection to the information covered by the secrecy provision. Most secrecy provisions are drafted without regard to the sort of precise tests in Part IV which determine whether disclosure should be refused on grounds such as unreasonable disclosure of business or personal affairs information. The use of the exemption provisions of the FOI Act also has the advantage that a person who disagrees with an agency's decision to grant or refuse access to a document is entitled to a statement of reasons for the decision and can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third criterion relates to the question of the resources required by an agency to make decisions on exemptions. Some agencies that process large numbers of requests have come to rely on the blanket exemption given by secrecy provisions for categories of information in the documents they possess. These agencies would need significant additional resources if they had to undertake consultation and make decisions on disclosure based on the reasonableness tests in the Part IV exemptions of the FOI Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The schedule to the Bill deals only with the narrow question of the role of secrecy provisions in limiting authorised public disclosure of documents under the FOI Act. But secrecy provisions also raise wider questions about the prevention of un authorised public disclosure and regulation of the flow of personal information between government agencies. These wider issues are under review elsewhere. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recently published its report on un authorised procurement and disclosure of information. The Gibbs Committee Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law is preparing a report on provisions of the Crimes Act dealing with disclosure of official information. The Attorney-General's Department is also conducting a review of certain aspects of Commonwealth secrecy provisions and will shortly be circulating a discussion paper for comment.The Bill does not implement all the Senate Committee's recommendations. Provisions in the FOI Act relating to the right of an individual to seek the amendment of incorrect or out of date material in personal records of government agencies are to be transferred to the Privacy Act. This will be done in a later Bill when the implications of the transfer for the different review systems in the FOI and Privacy Acts have been resolved. The changes to the FOI charges system recommended by the Senate Committee and agreed to by the Government will be implemented by amendments to the FOI Charges regulations.

         â€”Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I was speaking on this Bill and on this motion to refer the Bill to a select committee. I was responding to some remarks made by Senator Walters in her speech, in particular, the impact of money on the political process and the need for parties to raise large amounts of money to pay for the high cost of election campaigns. I pointed out to Senator Walters that in her own State of Tasmania there has been a royal commission into such matters as the attempt to bribe a member of parliament to cross the floor to enable the Government to survive. As part of that Royal Commission there have been investigations into why the leader of the Liberal Party in that State had $10,000 in a drawer for three months.

         â€”Including Western Australia. Irrespective of the political party all prove my point, and the point of the Government, that unless something is done to control the high cost of election campaigns this problem will continue to bedevil all political parties. In the end, it will mean that people in political parties will start taking desperate measures to raise money to pay for the cost of campaigns. Unless something is done, we could take that risk which in the end could pervert the political process in this country.

        In my view, we have already had evidence that the perversion is taking place; whether it is in Queensland where a number of people have actually been charged and been found guilty; or whether it is in northern New South Wales with the ICAC report. I point out, of course, that the ICAC report did not just deal with one political party, it dealt with members of both the National Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party who were involved in raising funds for their parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also have the case in Western Australia where the evidence so far in the Royal Commission, although it has not completed its findings, is that there was a major effort made by the leader of the Labor Party in the mid-1980s to raise large amounts of money. The reason for that is quite clear: money was to be raised and established in a trust fund and the interest thereafter would be used to pay for future election campaigns so that the party in Western Australia could be free of the perennial problem that all parties face from all sides about raising enough money to pay for an effective election campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that the overwhelming cost of election campaigns is television and radio. In metropolitan Sydney where a 60-second advertisement costs $30,000 to put on air in prime time-one might be required to put that advertisement on three or four times a night across all commercial stations-one is running up a bill of $100,000 plus on one night for one political party. If that is done over a 20-day campaign, one is looking at $2m or $3m worth of expenditure to run a reasonable campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        People say that to raise this money should be an unfettered right. Of course, one can take that simplistic view, but if one does one is accepting the fact that only a limited number of organisations and individuals can make those sorts of donations and that, in the end, all political parties will be beholden to those donors. All political parties would want to be released and free from being beholden to those sorts of people who make those donations.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a former Party official of the South Australian Labor Party, I certainly wanted to ensure that donations were made without strings attached. And when I was Party secretary they always were. There has been no evidence in South Australia to the contrary. But it meant that the South Australian Labor Party was always facing considerable financial difficulties to run any sort of election campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        The restriction-if people want to call it that-on free speech to enable the removal of the power of money over the political process is a price worth paying. The Government is now proposing only the removal of the ability of political parties and third party interest groups to advertise during an election campaign-a similar ban exists in most other Western countries with which we, as a democracy, would compare ourselves. In those countries people do not jump up and down in the streets or carry out extreme campaigns such as that of the Opposition, which is saying that it is an attack on free speech. It is and has been accepted by conservative, radical and social democrat governments in Western European countries that that is a reasonable outcome for democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has, with Japan, the most unrestrictive rules of all the major democracies. Therefore, it is not unusual that in the last decade in Japan there has been one scandal after another involving the liberal-democratic party, the socialist party, the social democrat party and even the democratic socialist party-the so-called clean party of Japan-all about raising money from business interests. In Japan there is no limit to how much one can spend in an election campaign. As a result, business interests have influenced the political process to such an extent that there are now endless scandals. As a result of those scandals, in the last 10 or 15 years Prime Ministers have fallen- come and gone. Japan, like Australia, is the only country in the Western world that has no restriction.
       </para>

        America has some restrictions on presidential elections. It has restrictions on congressional elections in that television and radio stations are forced to sell political advertising to candidates at the lowest discount rate offered to the biggest commercial bulk buyers. In Australia it is the other way around: political parties are charged a surcharge to buy television and radio advertising at short notice. Australian political parties pay more. They pay the highest rather than the lowest rates, as in America. Even the home of Western capitalism, America, has more restrictions than does Australia. Therefore, it is humbug of honourable senators opposite to talk about the end of free speech if this measure proposed by the Government is adopted.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was particularly interested in Senator Walters's speech. She made claims about free speech and cried out that it would be the end of free speech. Yet Senator Walters is a very active member of the Senate in wanting to ban 0055 telephone calls. She thinks that they contain matters of a sexual nature offensive to some Australians. Even though those phone calls are between consenting adults she wants to have them restricted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of Senator Harradine and others, the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies is now having a look at ways in which a restriction can be placed on adults making private phone calls to each other. That is a restriction on free speech. She is quite happy to have that restriction put in place. She thinks that it serves a social good.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not disagree that free speech has to be modified to meet the social objectives of society. But just as Senator Walters claims that a social good can be achieved by restricting 0055 telephone calls-private calls of a sexual nature; I do not necessarily agree with all of that-I believe that a social good can be achieved by restricting the power of money over the running of election campaigns, which strike at the very heart and the fundamentals of democracy in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I hear those opposite talk about free speech in election campaigns I would like them to be a little more consistent about free speech in other areas of society. But they want to pick and choose what suits their social prejudice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much has been made here by the Opposition about the fact that this has now been referred to a select committee. The Opposition proposed this two or three months ago. That is a matter of fact; no one can argue with that. The Government has referred it to a select committee-we are quite open about it-because the Australian Democrats cannot quite make up their minds about what they wish to support on some sort of restriction or reform in this area. Until we get agreement, at least from the Democrats, we know that the numbers in this place mean that nothing can be carried. Of course, those opposite are implacably opposed to any reform at all, no matter what the consequences for democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We make no bones about the fact that we are willing to put it to a select committee to ensure that there is still a good chance that a major reform can be achieved on the disclosure of donations and on the control of election spending.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been nominated by the Government side to be one of the members of that select committee if it is established by the Senate. I look forward to taking part in that committee's work. In the last parliament I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which brought down the report Who pays the piper calls the tune : minimising the risks of funding political campaigns. It was the first time in the history of this Parliament that a committee attempted to deal with the problem of advertising costs. This report broke new ground in Australia. This report is a seminal influence on where we are today. Though many people might not agree with all its recommendations, it started the public debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude about the public debate. Endless numbers of people have said to us that if these measures banning election advertisements in election periods were to be carried they would be the end of free speech. I do not disagree that a whole range of interest groups oppose this ban. Overwhelmingly, they represent money, they have vested interests and they have access to large amounts of money. They know that if their vested interest is under challenge by community debate or by legislation in this or other parliaments, they have the money to conduct a campaign in the media to get that legislation stopped, often by distortion, lies and misrepresentation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most other groups in the community do not have access to that sort of money to pay for that sort of campaign. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that in the mid-1980s the Victorian Government proposed changes to third party insurance for cars and workers compensation. This would have stopped the legal profession having a major involvement in that area of that industry, that commerce.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, it would have made the whole industry cheaper. They were the recommendations of various reports. But the legal profession was able to raise in excess of $1m to conduct a campaign in Victoria. There was television and radio advertising against that legislation. It was successful in convincing the Opposition-the National and Liberal parties in the upper House of Victoria-to reject the Bill in a major way. So a major reform that had been rationally proposed to reduce costs to consumers was ultimately defeated because of vested interests. The Victorian legal profession, which could have lost money, was able to conduct a campaign because it had access to that large amount of money.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that that is the perversion of democracy-the situation where one side has access to the money to carry out that sort of campaign. It might be of interest to the Senate to know that there was one lawyer in Victoria who objected to having his compulsory levy-a membership fee of a law society and a practitioner's fee-paid partly into that fund for that campaign. As a result, because of actions taken over several years by the law society in Victoria, he has now been struck off; he cannot practice. He has now been held in contempt of the Supreme Court of Victoria and is in hiding. It is the famous case of a Mr Little and it is all to do with the fact that he objected to his money being used to carry out a vested interest campaign, which he disagreed with, and his having no right of conscientious objection.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a side consequence, where there is a vested interest using its unfettered power. I believe the recommendation to send the Bill to a select committee takes note of the realities that we are faced with in this place in getting any reform through. One of the other opposition parties, whether it be the Democrats, the National Party or the Liberal Party, is going to have to agree to it.

         â€”Yes, they do have conscientious objection in the Industrial Court. If someone has a conscientious objection to joining a registered industrial union, that person can take a hearing to the Court and ask for conscientious objection, and in most cases that is upheld. There is no conscientious objection provision in respect of paying practitioner's fees to the law society of Victoria; none whatsoever. These are the very same people-the Law Council of Australia-which the Opposition is quoting as advocating free speech. They are not in favour of freedom of speech for Mr Little; they want to rub him out and put him in gaol for contempt. They will not give him the same conscientious objection that someone can get as a member of a registered blue collar union or other industrial union in Australia. The Law Council quotes freedom of speech. I hope it comes and gives evidence to the select committee, because I would like to ask a few questions about its notion of conscientious objection and of freedom of speech because of the way it has treated Mr Little in Victoria.

        I conclude by commending this motion to the Senate. I hope that we can return here with a report and a package of reform within a couple of months that at least a majority of the Senate can agree to and which will mean two things: full disclosure, so that there are no more hidden donations-no more money in paper bags or black suitcases or wherever it may be; and, secondly, no more right for a vested interest with access to unlimited money to dominate an election campaign, buy off political parties and pervert the political process in this country.

       <para>
        This is one of the most important reforms the political process in this country has had to face for a long time. I am proud that this Government has had the guts to fight it through, despite the opposition from the vested interests who are distorting the case, and so on. I look forward to coming back here in two to three months time, having the debate and getting the substantial reform through.

        I begin by reading a letter I received today. I have received many letters in relation to this matter. This letter is from the Borough of Eaglehawk, Victoria Street:
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been brought to the attention of my Council that legislation has been introduced, proposing bans on political advertising on radio and television.
       </para>
       <para>
        My Council considered this matter at its Ordinary Meeting held on the 25th July, 1991 and resolved to inform you that Council objects most strongly to legislation which proposes to ban political advertising on T.V. and radio. Such action is regarded as an attack on the freedom of speech in this country and furthermore, it can be seen as a distinct plot to prevent legitimate campaigning on such issues as road funding and financial support for the community. Accordingly, such legislation should not be deemed as appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is typical of the many letters and the many communications I have received from the community about this Bill. Contrary to what Senator Schacht, the previous speaker, had to say, outside the political parties, most groups that get involved in advertising of a political nature-and, of course, this affects them-are in fact community groups that are protecting the community interests. The ramifications of what is before us are very significant.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is appropriate that this Bill should be referred to a committee because it is insidious and it is flawed. It is a serious breach of the freedom of expression-I emphasise the word expression-and speech. I do not believe, as Senator Schacht has said, that one can legitimately compare the situation which exists between 005 calls and a ban such as this, albeit with the suggested amendments that came in late from the Government on the banning of political advertising on radio and television.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real question that has to be addressed in this Bill is: what are the purposes behind it? I would like to identify two of those. One is to try to overcome the financial problems of the Australian Labor Party and to fool the Australian public that it is trying to overcome the odium of the brown leather bags with the initials BB on them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us examine two aspects: one an omission and the other the flawed analysis regarding the costings around this Bill. It is interesting to note that there are amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942, amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1983, amendments to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, yet there are no amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Once again we see that this Government is protecting the elite in the trade union movement; the capacity which exists in section 269 and regulation 127 of the Industrial Relations Act makes it quite clear how simple it would be for the trade unions to launder money out through the back door. If the Government were truly genuine, in terms of this particular Bill, it would have put up amendments to address those particular problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        I quote, for example, the recommendations that were made by the Cooke inquiry in Queensland in terms of changes that needed to be made as far as the Industrial Relations Act was concerned, so that there would not be laundering of money out the back door and there would be protection of the individuals who were members of the unions. The first recommendation states:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) An industrial union shall not expend money which expenditure constitutes political objects unless it maintains a political objects fund which fund shall be separate and distinct from the other funds of the union.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) (a) A member of an industrial union shall not be required to make any contribution to the union for political objects unless-
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) a separate contribution therefore is determined by the union; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) the member has notified the secretary of the union in writing (and has not subsequently revoked the notification) that he desires to contribute to the political objects fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is very limited in its coverage of the full aspects of political donations. It leaves at least one aspect very wide open.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next matter I would like to raise about the reference of the Bill to a committee concerns a point that Senator Bolkus has consistently emphasised. I want to go to the interview he did on the 7.30 Report the other night. In answer to the second question that was asked of him by the interviewer, Paul Lyneham, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's proposal from the start has been to target the issue in total and the only way you can do that is not just to have disclosure but to contain campaign costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise the words `to contain campaign costs'. In question No. 6, once again Senator Bolkus makes reference to grappling with the costs of campaigning. Senator Bolkus puts the emphasis on containing costs, as he has done in other public statements and in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would now like to take the Senate through some of the costs of campaigning. I want to emphasise particularly how this Bill will transfer the costs of election campaigning to the taxpayer, the public purse, rather than campaigners raising money by means such as donations and functions. I will compare the costs of campaigning in Sydney and Perth, and the number of constituents in each. The figures that I cite do not include production costs. They are the actual costs of having advertisements shown or getting direct mail out.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Sydney the cost of four 30-second spots of prime time television advertising is $50,700. For radio advertising the cost of 30 spots on top rating stations in Sydney is $9,200. For press advertising in Sydney, the cost of full pages in most popular tabloids, as I said, excluding production costs, is $11,600. Now we move to what the emphasis will change to-that is, public purse expenditure. The cost of direct mail to households in Sydney, which number 1,252,000, is $137,700. If we look at personalised direct mail, which the Labor Party has specialised in in recent times--

        Putting aside all the other arguments that have been put forward, I suggest that this proposal would increase the cost of election campaigning because the main means of communication with the electorate will be forced to be through direct mail and personalised direct mail. That will have to be done in the election campaign context-and it will happen; people should make no mistake about that. It is happening now. But I re-emphasise the point that that will be paid for primarily from the public purse.

        No doubt we will have the Bill back before us and we will argue points other than the details.

In fact, it could well increase it, but at the expense of the taxpayers of Australia.

The purpose of the Bill is notionally to impose a ban on the broadcast of political advertisements, to strengthen the rules relating to donations received by political parties and to increase public funding for each Senate vote. That is how the Australian Labor Party would have us describe the Bill and, albeit rather pathetically and without much gusto, that is how it has tried to sell it to the Australian electorate. That, at least, is what it was saying until the end of last week. It is said that a week is a long time in politics, and nowhere is that better applied than to the Labor Party.

        The simple fact is that the Labor Party is on the nose around Australia, even in States where it holds government. Even in those States, its hold is fairly tenuous. In Western Australia, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the prospect of going to the polls is frightening because the Labor Party knows that it will be resoundingly and deservedly thrashed in those States. The money makers of the Labor Party, my colleagues on the other side of this chamber, have lost their enthusiasm for their jobs. They are under the scrutiny of various royal commissions and the like. The fact that there are no Brian Burkes raking in the lolly over cosy lunches any more is obviously worrying the Party in government here. Those days are over, and the local bagmen do not have the charisma to entice too many people to the dinner table.
       </para>
       <para>
        The hard fact is that the various State offices of the ALP are still trying to pay off the excesses of the last Federal election campaign. Some say that the Party is $7m in debt. Some other people say that it may be $17m in debt. But I do not think it matters whether it is $17m or whatever. Maybe $17m is close to the mark.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against that background, we have been brought back here this week to talk about this Bill. We have been called back to Canberra a week ahead of schedule because the Federal Government was convinced it had to have this political broadcasting ban Bill put through. Government members have had two months to change their minds, but Senator Bolkus obviously could not be bothered with work during the recess and clearly only put his mind to his job last week-or maybe he put his mind to the job when the Australian Democrats decided that they were going to have a leadership tussle. Maybe that changed his mind. I do not quite know what changed his mind. It might have been that Senator Parer and Senator Olsen have done such a good job in exposing what the ALP is trying to do to the Australian people. I think that probably has a lot to do with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is only since the end of perhaps last week that we have heard from the Government or from the Minister on what is supposedly the burning issue for the Government of the day. Since the end of last week two entirely different positions have been put before us. Two months ago, any talk of sending this legislation to a committee or of curtailing the ban to an election period only was cynically dismissed by the Government. In fact, it was basically thrown out by the Government at the time. We were told that we could not do that because-and remember this-the Bill was all about preventing corruption at the Federal political level. But since last week all that seems to have changed. Apparently we are no longer worried about corruption outside an election period and now it may be a good idea to send the Bill to a committee. So things have changed quite dramatically.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it any wonder that the Australian electorate is fed up with governments? It is a pity that Senator Bolkus is not here because I think he would have learnt a little from the speeches made during this debate. Senator Crane gave a good speech a short time ago. Senator Bolkus cannot honestly think that people out in the real world will believe him when he takes one position on this legislation one day, another tomorrow and a third the following day. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has already examined political advertising. That Committee said that banning political advertising would be a denial of free speech. Are we now to assume that this Committee has changed its mind? We should not forget that the ALP was represented on that Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ALP would know all about doing favours for people in the corporate sector. It also knows that those corporate figures who supported the ALP so generously in the past are unlikely to do so in the future. Many of the cosy mates of the Prime Minister and the Labor Government who so generously supported the Labor Party in the past are now bankrupt or in gaol or have woken up to the fact that the ALP will not win another term, so they are asking themselves why they should waste their money by donating it to the Labor Party. If the Government had wanted to send this Bill to a committee, it could have done so during the recess and we could today have been debating the final outcome of the Bill, or we could all be in our electorates talking to our constituents, where we like to spend a great deal of our time.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation remains an attack on free speech and the basic freedoms associated with democracy. It presents horrific problems for people in the country areas in that during an election period the only source of communication that many people in outback areas have is television or radio. Those people will be denied hearing about the parliamentarians standing for election in their areas because advertising will not be allowed if the Labor Party gets its way with this Bill. The view of the Human Rights Commission and of many professors of law at several universities around Australia is that this legislation represents a denial of free speech. This Government is again wasting taxpayers' money. All it is doing is shuffling the chairs on the deck of the Titanic. If this legislation does not come back from the proposed committee completely dead, it will definitely be defeated in this place.

        I will finish on the point made by the National Secretariat of the Salvation Army in a letter that was sent to many of us just recently. I will quote that letter again because I think it is worth quoting. It says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Salvation Army has a further concern as the Bill affects the illiterate within our society who depend so much on the electronic media for their understanding of community issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this Bill were to go through, that opportunity would be denied to people who are illiterate or to those in the country areas who have access only to the electronic media. All that will be allowed is talkback radio or people being seen on particular shows on television. I suppose the Government would have a bit of a start in that instance, and that is why it wants to ban any advertising on the electronic media.

         â€”I am pleased to rise this afternoon to speak on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991. I am sorry that I have to do so in the present circumstance. This piece of legislation is the most sleazy, sordid and grotty measure to have been introduced into this Parliament in my 10 precious years in this place. It is designed for two purposes. The first is to overcome the acute financial dilemma in which the Labor Party finds itself-the bankruptcy into which it has plunged itself. The second is to be seen to be cleansing the Labor Party of the machinations and the imbroglio that are consuming it from the west coast of this nation. The Labor Party is attempting to be seen to be on the side of the angels when the vast majority of its funding has come, no doubt, from those on the west coast.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Labor is already in debt. It knows that its financial base, its capacity to raise funds, is totally exhausted. Labor asks itself in a pragmatic way where it will get funding for the next election that will compete with that of the Liberal Party, modest as our resources are. Under Labor big business becomes small business. The big businesses that are left would never support Labor under any circumstance. When Labor looks at small business it sees record bankruptcies. It sees small businesses closing down every day, taking down the shingle. It asks itself, `Is that a source of funding for us?'. Of course it is not. If the businesses that are left could afford to fund anybody, they would be funding alternative parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Labor Party then turns to the untaxed, traditional source of funding, the trade union movement. It sees a million people out of work. It is not just in percentage terms that the workers of this country, few as they are, are leaving the trade union movement. The aggregate percentage of people in the trade union movement has dropped dramatically because people are now in the unemployment ranks. They are not paying their union dues; they are trying to scratch together a few dollars to buy bread for their family.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Labor Party knows that it has no economic capacity, no financial base, no ability to mount a competitive campaign for the next election. We have been told by Senator Schacht and Labor senators who have been audacious enough to try to justify this cynical piece of legislation that there is a touch of altruism about it, that it is actually intended for the good of this country. That is breathtaking in its audacity. The truth of the matter is that if the Labor Party were altruistic, if it believed this legislation had some intrinsic virtue, it would have introduced it eight years ago. Eight years ago Labor was more popular than it is now. There was a more benign and misled community, prepared in part to finance the Labor Party. But the Labor Party knows now that it cannot get financing, and it is trying to find a way of creating an even playing field. That does not mean simply that both parties are on the same plateau; it means that the Labor Party denies all other political parties any advertising, which, of course, means any funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of that cynical, crude attempt at bludgeoning the community into ignorance, this Government is prepared to smother freedom of speech. It is prepared to snuff out the essential, legitimate right of freedom of expression. It is prepared to strike at the very heart of the first basic freedom. While we have this Government pontificating, strutting around the world stage, hectoring South Africa because the black community does not have the freedom of a vote, the Labor Party in this country is denying the essence of freedom of speech, the freedom of knowledge and the freedom of getting of wisdom.

This proposal, of course, is a stark contradiction. I love this about the left wing of the ALP: it is the first in the vanguard with these tricks, and these deals and these whiz-bang, clever manoeuvres to hang on desperately to office, yet it goes out with this heart-rending care for the right of expression, the right to freedom, the right to representation and the very right to life itself.

        Of course, without freedom of speech there cannot be freedom of elections. Without the right of communication, without the right of transfer of information, nobody could be genuine in the claim that there could be free elections. A free election is about competition for ideas. A free election is about exposing one's philosophies and ideals and policies to the public in each and every forum. It is about the competition between conflicting philosophies and ideals and policies. It is about the interaction amongst voters; intellectual intercourse between members of parliament, candidates and the public.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is about exposing voters to what one believes in, to what one's ideals are, to what one aspires to and to what one offers people. It is about parading that which one represents in all forums. In modern society a fundamental part of the transfer of knowledge is communication through the television screen. A free election is about having the opposition-whoever it might be-scrutinise and criticise and examine the policies which are being put up. It is about assisting the public in arriving, at the end of the day, at what they judge to be, on balance, a sensible conclusion in terms of the competition being offered between the conflicting political parties and their candidates.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one takes away the capacity to impart that knowledge, as this legislation would have us do, one takes away the right of individuals and the right of the community to make those judgments. They are being asked to make those judgments in darkness and in barren ignorance. That is the last, desperate throw of the dice of this Government. Frankly, if it could get away with it, it would abolish polling booth workers because it will be short of them too this time around. It would abolish how-to-vote cards.

It was only because one could see `Labor' in the small print on the how-to-vote card that one actually knew who was handing them out. There are compelling reasons for having polling workers and for handing out how-to-vote cards. If the Labor Party could do away with all those devices-

I am saying that when the Labor Party came to the conclusion that people were leaving it in droves and would not be voting for it, it had to convince people to vote for the minor parties. When the present Government came to the conclusion that it could not get people to put it as number one on the ticket, it went to the minor parties and, having bribed and bought off most of them, it had them put Labor ahead of Liberal on the how-to-vote card and it then persuaded people to vote for it. There was nothing very subtle, intelligent or clever about it, but it worked. As a result of that, this Government limped over the line.

        It convinced people to vote for the minor parties through those obscene television commercials which, as I said earlier, showed us blowing up Crocodile Dundee's home territory.

I am of the view that almost everything on television affects somebody, somehow, in some way, for some reason.

        This Government, being intellectually and financially bankrupt, now wants an even playing field. It knows that dollars follow votes. It knows that when it is up in the polls, it is a sign that small business people and other members of the community will assist the funding of its campaigns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government members are terrorised by the ground swell of opinion against them this time around. They can see a great big wall of water about to dump on them. The Government knows that this community will pay anything to get rid of it. Pensioners will donate whatever is left of their cheques to guarantee, ensure, contribute and add to this lot being dumped ignominiously out of office. It knows that none of those contributions will be made out to the Labor Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        So how does it stop us? It simply takes away the source of the funding. It takes away the area where people would be spending their money. That is what it is all about-nothing more, nothing less. It is a crude, cynical, sleazy scheme to ensure that there is no advertising and that people will not make the judgment about the Government that they should. Not only does it deny advertising to political parties; it denies groups in the community with a strong political view putting that forward on the television screen and conveying what used to be taken for granted-freedom of speech, the right of expression, the right of transfer of information and the right of transfer of knowledge. This Government would cynically take it away for the grotty endeavour of being returned yet again to visit a plague upon this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I will touch on the question of public disclosure. In essence, I think there is a community view in this chamber about the need to tighten the disclosure of funding of political parties, because the present system, as it works, ensures that in some way certain donations will not be shown to be accountable. I am not saying that that is illegitimate, but it is part of the nature of the present creature of legislation that we have.

        This is a new-found sense of altruism that is causing blushes on the cheeks of members of the Labor Party. It is not one that has worried them before. It comes for two reasons. As I said from the outset, the first is to be seen to be cleansing themselves from the inevitable tide of discontent visiting the body politic generally, arising from WA Inc.-a royal commission, by and large, about the activity of the Labor Party in office, an examination of its relationship with big business and the community generally. Some revelations thus far could lead one to conclude superficially that it is not what it should have been.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a general view in the community that all is not well with the financial relationship between the Government and business. In a very superficial way-I put it no higher than that-it has already touched the Federal Government. When we get to the point where it is big news because a major donor is photographed in the same fishing boat as the Prime Minister, we can see the political hype that can be stimulated and created with this issue. The Government is not unaware of that. So, to be seen to be doing something constructive and positive, to be distancing itself from the inevitable trauma that is going to unfold over the coming months in Western Australia, it has proposed that we have a more substantial form of disclosure of funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        With respect, it would be unwise, misleading and almost foolhardy for anybody to believe that public disclosure prevents corruption, because crooked people do not fill in a form saying, `$300,000 bribe, but do not tell anybody. I am filling in the form as the Act demands'. Those things go unannounced and unreported. To that extent, any amount of demand of disclosure will not prevent any corruption, any impropriety or any offences under any Act.

It would not establish prima facie-and that is what we have to be very careful about-any sense of impropriety or misconduct by the recipient. If Robert Holmes a Court or his estate gave $1m to the Labor Party, I would not jump to the conclusion that there was something corrupt in that relationship. That is the difference between the giving on the one hand and the giving on the other.

But to the extent that there is a taint and a stench about it that has been visited on this Government and that its members have felt the necessity to distance themselves, that is the essential reason for it. If there had been a more altruistic reason for imposing disclosure, they would have found it eight years ago. Another transcending and compelling reason for their disclosing is that they have nothing to disclose.

        I cannot imagine any well judged, well run and well balanced business giving any money to the Labor Party after the last eight years.

As for the million people who are unemployed, it is highly unlikely that any ground swell of opinion from the general public will bring a flood of money to the Labor Party's coffers. So the Government can expect a nil return.

        This situation is what one would call in the newfound language of modern society a `win-win position' for members of the Labor Party. They have taken away from other political parties the need for funding, which places all political parties on an equal footing in terms of campaigning. It also distances them from WA Inc. and gives the impression of newfound integrity.The disclosures that they will have to make this time around-I suspect with the most elastic of imaginations-will not be able to imply that there is any improper conduct because those relationships will not exist. As I said from the outset, I find this a very sleazy and sordid arrangement which has been entered into by members of this Government for the purpose of preventing its death rattles becoming absolutely and inevitably mortal.

         â€”On commencing my speech on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, I return to what Senator Schacht said a little earlier. He gave us a great diatribe as to why this ban on political advertising should be legislated for. What I could not understand was that all he said could have applied in 1983, 1984, 1987 or any time around then. Yet neither this Government nor the Australian Democrats, to my knowledge, said anything whatsoever at the time. Senator Schacht then said that he wanted everyone to have the right of equal access to material throughout Australia.

       <para>
        With that in mind, and in case the Democrats failed to send this legislation off to a committee or, indeed, helped the Government put the legislation through, I took some figures out. If we ban electronic advertising, we have to rely entirely on the print media. I took figures out that affected the rural and remote areas of Western Australia because the cities have proper access to newsprint if they so want it. I believe, and I can prove by these figures, that the remote and rural areas would be mostly affected.

       <para>
        The commercial television channels and the ABC provide television services in Western Australia to 426,000 people outside the cities-that is, outside the metropolitan area. However, in this case, we are looking only at the commercial stations. One hundred and fifty-six thousand people live in what I class as remote areas. In addition, there is piggyback carriage of that television coverage onto the satellite, which transmits programs to those in really remote areas such as mining camps, et cetera.
       </para>
       <para>
        The banning of political advertising on electronic media will deprive the rights of those people in remote areas to access current information about the political parties, current affairs, et cetera. I found from my figures that 18 per cent of the city population, or 25 per cent of the voting population, buys a daily newspaper. I certainly had no idea that the percentage was so low. If there were a ban on electronic media, people could turn around and buy a newspaper, if it were available-they will certainly be available in the city-to learn about the latest news or advertising. But in remote areas it is far different.
       </para>
       <para>
        In comparison to the 18 per cent in the city who buy a newspaper, only 13 per cent of the population in the remote areas have available, and buy, a newspaper. This means that 79 per cent of country voters do not receive a daily newspaper. As I said, even if many of them wanted to, they could not because they are in remote areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        In comparison, access to the electronic media is almost 100 per cent because as well as the normal commercial broadcasts in electronic media there is the satellite, as I have said. Through the satellite, people can access both radio and television. If people have the necessary equipment, 100 per cent of Western Australia has access to electronic media.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, newspapers are either late or not available in remote areas. When they are available in certain towns, they cannot be distributed out to the stations, mining camps, et cetera. I will give an example. I have examined different shires. Residents throughout the State in some towns-for example, from Kununurra to Esperance-receive daily newspapers. Outside those areas in the smaller communities, such as the Aboriginal communities, people may see one newspaper a week via mail runs and that sort of thing. Mining camps, individual prospectors and road gangs are all definitely cut off from receiving newspapers. This means that the vast majority of those 340,000 rural voters are without newsprint.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, in the Shire of Halls Creek, only people in the town have access to newspapers, yet the shire-which is right at the top of the Kimberleys, almost into the Northern Territory-has a population of 2,000. The town would have probably 100 to 150 people, and they are the only ones in that shire who have access to newspapers. Therefore, at least 1,500 people out of that 2,000 would certainly not have either daily or even weekly access to a newspaper. So it is useless for either the Government or anyone else to say that we could move over to newsprint and it would be cheaper to run. It can be done but people will not have equal access, and Senator Schacht did say that he believed everyone should have equal access.
       </para>
       <para>
        These figures can be repeated for various communities, such as Wiluna and Warburton, which I will not bore honourable senators with at this stage. I believe that a paid advertising ban, as well as being discriminatory in whom it may reach, is certainly a blot on our democratic right to publicly express views critical of government. It will deprive groups as a whole of their right to comment. Honourable senators may remember the campaign by a national motoring association during the last election. I believe it was very effective in convincing the Government that more money had to be spent on roads. Such groups will be heavily disadvantaged.
       </para>

        If political parties have not had the skills in the past to manage their campaign funds and have overspent their budgets, then I do not believe their burden should be carried by all Australians. I know that in the flush of the 1980s there was a lot more money coming forward for these campaigns than at other times. Unfortunately, in this case the Labor Party seemed to budget on that sort of money coming through forever.

        Mr Acting Deputy President, you know how much the Labor Party outspent the Opposition in the 1987 and 1990 elections. Unfortunately for the Labor Party, that money is not coming through any more. Senator Bolkus wants to use this ban to get over that problem by preventing the Opposition, and maybe the Democrats, from putting their views on how the Government has operated in the last 10 years. Then in the dying stages of the game, leading up to this week's sittings we had different moves to keep this Bill alive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Forgive me if I am not totally correct in my understanding because I have just come back from a reasonably lengthy period overseas with a parliamentary delegation, but I understand that one move was to ban political advertising in the last three months leading up to an election. No-one has called out that that is wrong. The only person in Australia who knows when an election is coming is the Prime Minister. He is the only one who knows when it is coming. So the party in government can work out a good advertising campaign, because it knows within three months when there is going to be an election, and can leave the opposition of the day lamenting. If an advertising campaign were in place, would a Prime Minister be prevented from calling an election within three months? That is a question I would like answered. I do not think it is the way to go. I believe it is nothing but a suppression of freedom of expression.
       </para>
       <para>
        The parliamentary delegation of which I was a member went to Eastern Europe and saw the result of 45 years of communist government. If honourable senators want to see what 45 years of suppression has done to four nations that we visited, then I suggest they visit those places to see for themselves. A friend of mine, the late Andrew Mensaros, who died about two months ago, came from Eastern Europe. He suffered first under the Nazis and then under communism. He managed to escape and then came to Australia. He was the first non-British, non-Celtic born person elected to a Parliament in Australia. He always used to tell me and others that Australians took their freedoms too lightly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Every time a Bill which concerned freedom came before the Western Australian Parliament-and he had a lot to say when the Australia Card debate was on-he would be the first to speak out. He always spoke out the most in Western Australia because he believed we take our freedom too lightly. In this case the Opposition is not taking it too lightly, but certainly some Australians are. It is another freedom that we will lose if we do not watch what we are doing. If we lose it, then it will be one freedom that will be very hard to get back.

         â€”At this stage in the debate there is little that I can contribute that is new. My colleagues have covered the debate very carefully and skilfully. But I want to clarify, from the meanderings that have come from the Government benches, what the argument of those opposite is. As I understand their argument, they are saying that free speech must be banned because it costs money: advertising free speech costs money; therefore it must be banned, because to cost money causes corruption, and corruption is bad for the state; corruption is bad for the Government and therefore we must ban free speech and ban advertising so that the state will not be corrupted. As I understand it, in a nutshell, those are the meanderings that have come from those opposite.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Put another way, what that seems to say is this: free expression could seriously threaten the state; overall personal liberty depends upon the degree of freedom that can be enjoyed by the nation; therefore, the freedom of the individual will be narrower the greater the danger to the state. That is what I understand the argument of the Government to be. If that is the Government's argument, can I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it is not a new argument. It is an argument that is some decades old now. I will quote from this article:
       </para>
       <para>
        He argued that the free expression of opinion could seriously threaten the state, and that personal liberty depended upon the degree of freedom that `can be enjoyed by the nation, and the freedom of the individual will be the narrower the greater the dangers are that temporarily threaten the state'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the same argument, as I understand, that the Government is putting. This is not a new argument. This is one that Joseph Goebbels put when he banned free speech in Germany just before the Second World War. That quote was from a book titled Nazi Propaganda by Z.A.B. Zeman. It is published in association with the Wiener Library, London Oxford University Press, 1964. That suggestion of limiting free speech because the greater interests of the state are involved is one that must be, and has to be, rejected at all times. It was an argument that, as well as being put by this Government, was put by a regime that will go down in history as the greatest undemocratic and dictatorial regime in our history, a regime that quickly brought in the one-party state and caused the murders of some six million people. It shows that we must be forever vigilant against any limitation at all of our freedom of expression.
       </para>
       <para>
        One cannot limit freedom of expression one little bit without starting to lose the freedoms we enjoy. Any limitation, no matter how small, must be rejected and rejected at all cost. We must never countenance anything-any government action-that limits free speech in any way because it has been done before and is the first action that people intent on one-party states, on dictatorships, and on completely undemocratic regimes embark upon. I do not suggest that this Government intends to go that far, but once one gives away some of one's liberties, one has given away some of the freedoms one enjoy. That must never be allowed to happen in Australia.

         â€”The Opposition supports the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill. We will have a couple of amendments but they do not diminish the thrust of our support in any way. The Opposition's support for the Bill is significant because it is the first time in eight years that there has been bipartisan support for a major piece of Aboriginal affairs legislation. This has developed largely because of the volume of discourse between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), as both sides of the Parliament have sought to end up with a package that would have bipartisan support.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that when the matter was first raised there were some concerns on this side of the chamber. In demonstrating how talking together about these matters can be of use, it is only right to mention that there were concerns and that discourse between the two sides of the Parliament has removed them as far as almost every member is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was concern earlier that the Council could be a body for activists and that it could end up like another Constitutional Commission doing its own thing and not really aware of the imperative put on it by the political process. As I said, many of us were concerned as to what it might actually achieve on the ground for Aboriginal people. As a result of that hard work on both sides, the Council stands a chance of setting new ground for Commonwealth advisory bodies in terms of its focus, its goals, and, hopefully, its outcome. That is the basic bottom line of this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The key question we have to ask ourselves when looking at this kind of legislation is: are we doing things that will make things better or worse for the Aboriginal people and for those white Australians who are involved with and concerned for the Aboriginal people and the society as a whole?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is particularly pleased that the Council will focus its work mainly on a process of reconciliation at a community level rather than at some other exalted level. Where things have worked well in the past, they have done so because people at a community level have made the effort to get along in solving their own problems. In the past, at the community level, many things worked in spite of governments, not because of them-and, I might say, without being too critical, in spite of some things that this Government has done, not because of them. We are overjoyed to see that the concentration of this council will be at the community level.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition also had a concern about not wanting to raise the hopes and expectations of Aboriginal people only to see them dashed. This is certainly the clear message that the Opposition has received from Aboriginal people and organisations when consulting them about this Bill. We must avoid that, and I think we have done so. The concern that expectations should not rise too much was one reason our shadow Minister in the House of Representatives, Dr Wooldridge, worked very hard with the Minister in trying to develop a common interest and to put behind a lot of the political animosity that has existed in the past eight years, in particular, in relation to Aboriginal affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that if anything is to be achieved in the area of Aboriginal affairs it must be through simple practical solutions with realistic, measurable and achievable goals, with cooperation rather than confrontation and with hard work free from political bickering. One of the reasons we wish to move an amendment to this legislation is to establish those clear goals. The second amendment that I intend to move will be to add new clause 6(1) (k), that the Council should:

       <para>
        . . . monitor and evaluate:

       <para>
        Another amendment which I intend to move relates to the rewards that should be given to people who are on this Council. I do not think that these are petty; they are quite significant. When the whole question of the Council first came up in the Government's discussion paper back in December, I-like, I think, all Opposition members-was particularly pleased that no fees were intended to be paid to members of the Council. In essence, this was because the Council was going to comprise a group of prominent Australians, giving their time voluntarily to try to achieve something worthwhile in this important area.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the past, committees of government have been open to the criticism that they exist as an end in themselves, rather than to try to achieve something really worth while. While the Opposition does not want people to be out of pocket for serving on such a committee, they should not, in our view, make money out of it. We do not want to see this as another `jobs for the boys' situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, we will be moving an amendment, which I hope is being circulated, which says that a person other than an ex-officio member of the Council who is a member of the Council or a member of a committee, or who is both, is to be reimbursed the expenses that the person reasonably incurs in performing duties under this legislation.

         â€”Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I regret to say that I do not have any further copies with me. I will be moving the amendments in the committee stage; I just thought I would mention them at this point in the second reading debate. By the way, the reason for the first amendment-that is, that there should be benchmarks-is that there always seems to be an expectation, particularly in matters affecting Aboriginal affairs, that the process of assistance somehow equals the outcome. As Dr Wooldridge outlined, when in the past he has asked questions of ATSIC about outcomes, he has generally got piles of facts and figures as to how the Government is doing things, but they do not say what the Government is actually achieving.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As I said earlier, we have to concentrate on the question of whether everything we are doing is making things better or worse. It is absolutely fundamental that there should be benchmarks by which we can see whether we are making things better or worse. I agree with Dr Wooldridge that the impression of many people in matters relating to Aboriginal affairs is that a lot of governmental actions over recent years have made things worse rather than better, that things have been going backwards despite all our best endeavours. Unfortunately, we have no objective way of working out where we really are, where we are coming from and where we are going to. That is one of the reasons why we think this amendment is absolutely vital.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is hopeful that the Council will provide some leadership within the Aboriginal community. That is desperately needed in Aboriginal Australia and in the broader community today so that the whole community might take a fresh look at itself, its history and its hopes for the future. This somewhat hybrid Bill, which has been a product of Government and Opposition cooperation and bipartisanship, should--

         â€”I will take the Democrats' point-multipartisanship. It should at last give us something of a win in Aboriginal affairs. As I said, the general perception is that government intervention has tended to make things worse in terms of the relationship between the Aboriginal community and the rest of Australia. I believe and the Opposition believes that this Council provides an opportunity to make things better. It does not guarantee that things will get better; it does not mean that no more work has to be done. On all these matters it is the bottom line that matters-the bottom line of whether we are improving the prospects of reconciliation, the prospects of relationships between the Aboriginal community and the rest of Australia. On balance, because of the manner in which this Council has been born out of a bipartisan or multipartisan approach, depending on which view one takes, it should have a much greater chance of success than the approaches that have so largely failed in the past. To that extent, the Opposition wishes the Council well.

         â€”In my remarks I want to concentrate on the philosophical underpinning of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill, which is, quite literally, historic legislation. I am very pleased to be able to add the support of the Australian Democrats for this Bill to that of the Opposition and the Government in a multipartisan way. The establishment of a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation also represents a significant achievement for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, and I congratulate him on his commitment to getting this Council established.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Despite the strong support from the Democrats and me for this initiative, at the outset I must confess to some mixed feelings. I would like to stress strong support but at the same time express a few concerns about what must not be allowed to happen, and then to outline briefly some of the things I would like to see achieved through the establishment of this Council. It is an important event, a vital event. It provides a golden opportunity to address constructively the many problems still facing the indigenous people of this nation in a comprehensive and long term fashion.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very pleased to note that the preamble to this Bill makes a specific commitment to addressing the disadvantages faced by Aboriginal and Islander people. The fear I have, and one that I have already heard expressed by some Aboriginal and Islander people and taken up by Senator Michael Baume, is that the Council may degenerate into another bureaucratic talk-fest and travelling circus. I know that no-one wants this to happen, and many people who spoke to this Bill in the lower House have already stressed the need for the Bill to achieve concrete results. However, once the process is under way and some of the spirit of cooperation and mutual congratulation, which is occurring now, is replaced by emerging political differences, a possible result is for the whole procedure to deteriorate into posturing and rhetoric. We have seen it all happen before.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs in the lower House, Dr Woolridge, indicated in his speech in the second reading debate that an increasing atmosphere of suspicion has built up in relation to Aboriginal and Islander issues among many indigenous people as well as others in our society. It is important to understand that if this Council, which has so much potential, fails to deliver, it will mean not only that a golden opportunity has gone begging but also that further damage has been done to relations between the Aboriginal and Islander community and the non-indigenous community, with further suspicion ensuing. It will also mean that the Government's ability effectively to address the disadvantaged position of indigenous people will be further weakened. This would be a disastrous outcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have commenced my speech on this negative note because I believe that it is crucial that this Council not be allowed to fail. The history of Australia's treatment of its indigenous people since European settlement is one of virtually uninterrupted disaster. Even in the past 30 or so years, when serious attempts have been made to start redressing the vast injustices of the past, our record has still been abysmal. The opportunity presented to us by this Council must not be wasted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let this not, though, take anything away from the great opportunities which are presented by the establishment of this Council with the universal support of parliament. This is a major, positive initiative which must be given strong support by politicians and Australians across the social spectrum. The reports of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-many of us spoke about them in this place, and we know them to be comprehensive and in-depth reports-describe the reconciliation process as the fundamental backdrop to reform and change.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Minister has noted, the final recommendation of the Royal Commission strongly supports an effective reconciliation process. The final recommendation states that all political leaders and their parties should recognise that reconciliation between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in Australia must be achieved. This is essential if community discord, division and injustice to Aboriginal people are to be avoided.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another recent report-that of the national inquiry into racist violence-found that racist violence is an endemic problem for Aboriginal and Islander people in all Australian States and Territories. It also concluded that racist attitudes and practices-conscious and unconscious-pervade our institutions, both public and private. There can be no clearer indication that this is a major need which must be addressed if we are to substantially reduce it within our own lifetimes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Addressing the problems which face Aboriginal and Islander people requires more than just a set of ideals and good intentions. A lot of people have had those in the past. It requires political will on our part and a real commitment from all Australians to look again at their own attitudes and to willingly participate in creating essential changes. It is pleasing to see that the Bill makes provision for the Council to develop strategic plans for action in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation is about process, but it is about goals as well. The process and the goals should both, as far as possible, allow Aboriginal and Islander people to determine the way they want their culture and lifestyle to interact with non-indigenous society, and the best way to address the massive and systematic disadvantage which so many of these people currently face. But in addressing this, the emphasis must not be on Aboriginal adaptation to our way.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Wooldridge made a reference at the end of his speech during the second reading debate to a speech that he had recently heard and found moving. This speech was by the Aboriginal Bishop Malcolm from the Anglican Church, and it outlined the Bishop's hopes for the future. Bishop Malcolm acknowledged that everyone must look to the future and that the past cannot be undone, but he said that the first essential step for Aboriginal people towards a better future is for white people to simply say sorry. This does not mean endless waves of guilt-ridden, public self-flagellation as some might suggest. It simply means acknowledging that great wrongs have been done and that as a people we regret those wrongs. It also means learning from the past in order to create a better viable future for all of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        A similar theme is contained in the well known quotation by Xavier Herbert. Although the quotation relates specifically to land rights, I want to repeat it here because it so effectively captures the spirit which I believe must pervade the reconciliation process. Xavier Herbert said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Until we give back to Aborigines just a bit of the land that was theirs, and give it back without provisos, without strings to snatch it back, with complete generosity of spirit, in concession for the evil we have done him-until we do that, we shall remain what we have always been so far, a people without integrity, not a Nation, but a community of thieves.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a well known quotation. While I know there are some Australians who will not agree with the arguments in favour of land rights-and let me stress that land rights are not a predetermined outcome of this Council's deliberations-nevertheless, I hope that all Australians would agree with the need for a complete generosity of spirit and the need to admit and apologise for the damage that has been done. In an age of so-called economic rationalism, generosity of spirit could well be a bit of a foreign concept.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even those who see the marketplace as a sacred site must see that assisting and supporting a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and Islander people and the rest of the people of our nation makes economic sense. Supporting self-determination for Aboriginal and Islander people; improving communication and interaction between the indigenous peoples and the wider community; enabling Aboriginal and Islander people to participate in our society in a way that is meaningful to them-all of this should be achievable through the process we are now enacting, and such an outcome can only lead to a nation which is healthier, both socially and economically.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite what is often said about the recognition of cultural difference and cultural pluralism in Australia, it is clear that mainstream culture in Australia does not accept Aboriginal culture as a legitimate and separate culture. Mainstream culture is exploitative and is orientated towards economic and material values, and the difference is well exemplified by our attitude to land. This is also the case in relation to a number of other cultural elements. It is, therefore, important in the Democrats' view to recognise and maintain that cultural difference.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to make special mention of the role of the Torres Strait Islander people in this process. Being so far away from where most Australians live, and being so few in number-I think they total 30,000-Torres Strait Islanders are often forgotten, yet they are a people with a distinct culture and history and they are fiercely and justifiably proud of this. Although it is not reflected in the title of this Bill, the Council is intended to involve Islander people as well as Aboriginal people. I am sure Islander people will play a valuable role in the process over the rest of this decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is another important component of the reconciliation process which has not received much attention to date. In addition to the widely acknowledged need to develop and establish reconciliation between the indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, there is a need for reconciliation between the Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait Islander people themselves-I think they call it sweeping their own house clean first. There are two distinct groups, with their own history and culture, and they have some ongoing differences. It is important that the process gives both groups the opportunity to resolve these. I know this is something which many people, particularly in Queensland, want to address, and I hope they can address it through this Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another distinct group of people is South Sea Islanders. These are people whose descendants were brought to Australia forcibly and they are not strictly indigenous people of this country, yet strong cultural identification between South Sea Islanders and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders exists, and these people, too, suffer similar discrimination and disadvantage. As with our indigenous people, exploitation of their labour contributed significantly to the economic development of our nation. Their role in this process is less clear, but I still hope that it will be given consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is no great statement to say that we, as part of what is broadly called European or Western society, have a lot to learn from the cultures of Aboriginal and Islander people. Yet the level of ignorance within our society about the history, culture and current disadvantaged position of Aboriginal and Islander people is still shameful. It is, therefore, pleasing to see that the Minister has indicated that education is to be a central role of the Council. This education must reach not only the younger generation but also the adults of our society who are not undertaking formal education.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important role of the media in the educative process is obvious and I strongly urge workers, educators, managers and owners of the media-all two of them-to take this role seriously. Both the Royal Commission and the inquiry into racist violence addressed many of their recommendations to the media, but I have yet to see or hear many indications that these have been noted, or that any follow-up on their implementation has been undertaken. I appeal to the media industry to recognise its responsibility in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Parliament as a whole that, as I have just indicated with the media, we also have a major responsibility not just to support this Council but to continue showing our commitment to tackling the major problems that exist now. There are many fundamental issues which need to be addressed and actions that need to be taken now. I am not going to press them at the moment, but I am certainly going to do my best to make sure that they are addressed as part of my nomination to the Council and my contribution to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we need convincing that governments still have a long way to go to showing true commitment to building bridges between the indigenous and non-indigenous people in this country, we have to look only at the atrocious actions of the Goss Labor Government in Queensland in relation to land rights legislation. Here is a party that has unambiguously promised clear-cut action for many years, and it has received the electoral support of the majority of Aboriginal and Islander people over that time as a result. Once in power, out came the grand statements that it would deliver on its promise. Yet within the space of a very short time, the promises are broken and the Party's policy ignored.
       </para>
       <para>
        Leaving aside the pros and cons of the broader issue of land rights and the final shape of the legislation, I want to argue that the damage caused by the divisive process of this legislation to the black community's perceptions of government and our society was immense. The consultation process, on which we are placing a great store here, was farcical, with mining companies, pastoralists and environmentalists all being given a better hearing than the indigenous community. The legislation was rushed through in a way that would have made former Premier Bjelke-Petersen blush.
       </para>
       <para>
        What sort of message does this give when we are trying to convince Aboriginal and Islander people that our intentions are genuine and honourable? Ironically, this legislation in Queensland was being rammed through Parliament in its divisive way at the same time as the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill-which is all about consultation, reconciliation and long term aims-was being debated here in the House of Representatives. As Mr Bob Katter said at the time, and as Dr Wooldridge also implied in his speech, in many ways it is far worse to raise hopes with grand promises and statements and then fail to deliver than it is to do very little. We must ensure this does not happen on this occasion. It is part of the nature of this process to raise expectations and it is our duty to strive to fulfil them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have read the speeches by Minister Tickner and by Dr Wooldridge very closely and I note the different things they are looking for from this process. Whilst there may be some differences between them, these are certainly not incompatible. I know that both men have had to do some negotiating within their own parties, and with each other, in order to get agreement to this legislation, and I congratulate them for their efforts. I was pleased to see the Minister strongly stress the need for continuing the fight to address disadvantage, and I am sure he realises that he still has a lot of convincing to do-even within his own Government-to get these matters addressed more seriously than they currently are.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also acknowledge the aims and hopes for this process which the coalition expressed through Dr Wooldridge's speech. He also expressed the necessity for concrete achievements and specific goals, and I support that intention. I notice that the coalition also gained an amendment to the Bill which allows the nomination of a member of the Council who is not a member of parliament. I think it would be a shame if the coalition were not to have a representative from the parliament on the Council as I feel it would diminish the spirit of parliamentary cooperation which we have established with the passage of this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition has also stressed the need for the Council to focus and operate at a community grass roots level-Senator Baume mentioned that-and it has made this a condition of its support for the process. I acknowledge the intent behind this condition as being a good one, but I do have some worry that the coalition might stick too exclusively to this. As Father Frank Brennan said recently in an article in the Catholic Leader:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . social change and reconciliation have to work on many levels-personal and local levels, but also structural and national levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that many people, including Mr Hawke, Dr Hewson and Commissioner Elliott Johnston have been making the point that the approach should concentrate on the process of reconciliation and not on any instrument which might be an outcome of the process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst I do not wish to go against this sensible approach and attempt to pre-empt any outcome, I would remind the Senate that a resolution was adopted by this House at the time the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill passed through this chamber. This resolution concluded with the words that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . an instrument of understanding and reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be negotiated by the Australian Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know those words `an instrument of reconciliation' were the words of Senator Coulter. Whilst I know some people do not place much significance on the resolutions of this place or the words of politicians, I would hope that we would all at least keep this resolution in mind and not just allow it to become, again, the mere words of politicians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The task ahead is a difficult one and 2001 is not far away at all, but I believe there are sufficient signs to give hope that substantial achievements can be gained through the process which we are starting here tonight. The fact that all parties are supportive of the process sends a message to all Australians that we need to join together to work for understanding and justice for Australia's indigenous people. The fact that indigenous cultures in our country have managed to survive so well in the face of so many obstacles is a tribute to the perseverance and the determination of the indigenous people to overcome injustice.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been much talk lately of the need to make Australia a republic by the Centenary of Federation in 2001. Whilst this is a matter of importance, it will be a hollow celebration if we were to become a republic without making substantial progress towards redressing the many injustices which the original inhabitants of this country have had to endure. In 1988 we were exhorted to participate in the celebration of a nation. As we look to 2001, our sights must be set on the creation of a nation. The Council for Reconciliation must be at the centre of this. As the Minister said, this is a process which the whole nation must embrace, and it is a process which must not be allowed to fail.

       Mr President, the statement that you have just made to the Senate raises a number of issues with regard to the operation of the Senate. This has been an ongoing saga over the last few days. I think the issue of primary concern to all honourable senators is that issue relating to transport.

        â€”Mr President, I find this an absolutely intolerable situation. We are not talking about the blockading or picketing of some little fish and chips shop in the suburbs. We are talking about a blockade of the Parliament. It is absolutely intolerable that you, as a Presiding Officer, and the Ministers of this Government will take no action to guarantee free access to the Parliament. This Government could not import people fast enough to break a strike that took place about a year ago. The Government turned out the armed services so that services could be provided. What was involved in that instance was something far less than a blockade of the Parliament.

       Why is not something being done in this circumstance? On the admission of the Australian Labor Party, we are faced with an illegal strike. I do not know the mythology and the hagiography of what the Labor Party goes on with. But apparently this strike has no substance at all. It has gone before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which has found that there is no basis for it at all and that the people involved should all return to work. The people involved in the strike were allegedly employed in this building. The Commonwealth car drivers have nothing at all to do with it. Yet, they are taking part in a secondary boycott.

       Mr President, why will not you, as a Presiding Officer, guarantee free access to this Parliament? Why will not the Ministry enforce the right of passage of all the citizens of the ACT into Parliament House? I note that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate)-the Minister for Federal Police-has left the chamber. He has gone-the heat is too much for him. He, as a member of the ministry, has a responsibility, as does every other Minister of this Government, to see that the law is upheld. Why is nothing being done?

Honourable senators on the other side have said that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has decided the issue. As you, Mr President, know-and this is the unfortunate position with which you have been left-the Industrial Relations Commission has decided no such thing. The Industrial Relations Commission has decided that it has no jurisdiction to decide this issue.

The issue is not whether a person has committed a crime; the issue is whether or not the court has jurisdiction.

He is in a dilemma and I do not think it helps him for us to get up and ask him why he does not do something when he does not have any power to do anything, other than to negotiate the matter through. It has been said that this is a secondary boycott. That would need to be argued. The people on the picket line seem to want to get their jobs back.

The facts are clear and they are: the Parliament and its workings are being impeded and parliamentarians are being impeded in going about their proper business on behalf of the people of Australia.

       I say that because, although at the moment the Parliament continues to work, it will establish a very clear precedent in this country. If people believe that, if they have a grievance against the Parliament and the individuals in the Parliament, they are entitled to mount a blockade, it will not be the finish of the matter when this sorry event is cleared up; it will start a precedent which will come to haunt this country and this Parliament. This is one of those issues upon which the Presiding Officers have to take a proper stand. Their duty is to the Parliament-not to the Labor Party and the conventions and practices of the Labor Party. There is no question of that in my mind.

       What is happening now is that a group of workers, who are in an extremely difficult situation, are coping with an industrial dispute and are taking legitimate industrial action.

The President has said he will ensure, while he is the President, that industrial disputes do not prevent the Parliament from discharging its obligations, and he is right to say that.

       Within that constraint, I support the workers' right to take the action that they are taking. What I reject entirely is the slathering enthusiasm of those in the Opposition to inflame this dispute. Those opposite live in fear and trepidation that it might be settled reasonably, that the negotiations which Mr President is patiently undertaking-which are the appropriate means of coping with this difficult situation-may resolve it reasonably, with a reasonable outcome for the workers and the Parliament. That is the way in which all industrial disputes-including this one-are best settled.

       I need to deal with one other matter that has been raised in this debate and that is the question of car C1. I am told that that particular vehicle did pass the picket line. The problem for all those people who got excited about it is that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been in Melbourne for the last two days and is still there. The car had no passengers. I am advised that the car did not break the picket line. It certainly did not carry the Prime Minister across the picket line.

        â€”There are a number of matters that I would like to address briefly. The first is that I was disappointed that Senator Cooney made allegations of a lack of sympathy for people who have lost their jobs. I think that is irrelevant to this debate. As was said by one of my colleagues, we have sympathy not only for these people but also for the 800,000 to one million other Australians who are out of work at the moment.

       I do not want to try to apportion sympathy. I do not want honourable senators to misinterpret what I have said, but at least these individuals have received a termination package, which is far more than what most of the other 800,000 Australians who are currently out of work have received. So I do not think the crocodile tears that we see on the other side are well founded because, if this Government really had sympathy for workers who are out of employment at the moment, it has within its resources the ability to do something about it. It could start next week with the Budget, because it is largely its economic policies that have got Australia in this tragic situation at the moment.

       Let us put the situation of individual workers aside for the moment because there is a matter of principle involved here, and I think that is where we on this side of the chamber differ from those on the other side. We believe that, as a matter of principle, it is wrong to blockade or otherwise impede access to the Parliament. We can argue about the degree of blockade or the degree of obstruction-and it may be that the degree of obstruction here is not as great as it would be if there were a line of trucks placed across the road or some other more vigorous enforcement of this line-but that does not seem to me to render the argument wrong. The argument is that it is wrong in principle that the Parliament be obstructed.
      </para>
      <para>
       What we have said to you, Mr President, is that if the Parliament is obstructed we believe that you, as the Presiding Officer, and your colleague, as the Presiding Officer in the other place, have a responsibility to remove that obstruction. Mr President, I acknowledge that it seems that you have been seeking to negotiate removal of this picket. You said to us yesterday that, after the resolution by the IRC, the picket should be removed. You said to us today that you have asked that the picket be removed, and it has not been removed. The question that therefore occurs to me is whether you have asked the Government for assistance; whether you have asked the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who is responsible for the Australian Federal Police, for assistance; and what action you have in fact taken to ensure that this wrongful obstruction to the Parliament is removed. I ask that question because my colleagues and I would like to know what action you have taken in that regard, and we would like to know what reaction you have received from the Government in that regard.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, as you said to us yesterday, Government senators were a party to this original decision. You communicated with all honourable senators and got very little adverse reaction from Government senators. Now that we have got to this stage, it seems that you need the support of the Government for the removal of this picket. Until you tell us otherwise we will presume, particularly on the basis of what Senator Bolkus said yesterday, that the Government is not prepared to support you in the removal of the picket.
      </para>
      <para>
       In answering that, Mr President, I ask that you answer one further question, because we on this side of the chamber are unclear as to what is now being sought in this dispute. The workers who have been dismissed have been paid a compensation package. The new contractor is now in possession and meeting the contractual responsibilities. You say to us tonight that you are continuing to negotiate in this dispute. What is being sought by those with whom you are negotiating? The two questions that I respectfully request be answered are as follows: firstly, is the Government supporting you in seeing that this picket is removed; and, secondly, what is now being sought by those who are continuing the dispute?

       I turn to a point that Senator Hill raised. Just yesterday we were discussing an urgency motion about the plight of unemployed people in this nation. Crocodile tears were flooding from the opposition benches yesterday. Opposition members were citing the fact that we have hundreds of thousands of unemployed people. What they are looking at outside these doors is a very small group of unemployed people that used to be employed by us and served us as recently as a few weeks ago.

I think that is an absurd proposition to put, with respect. Senator McLean does not have a mortgage on caring for these people, or their affection or relationships. But that is not the point. It is not a question of whether their cause is right or wrong. That is not what it is all about. It is a trite thing to say, and it could be said by the other side, but this debate in terms of who says what is thoroughly and absolutely predictable. If anybody on this side of the chamber dared to say that the union movement was breaking the law, that person would be automatically regarded as a union basher and Government senators would jump up and defend this breaking of the law because they felt that they had to take the union movement's side, to defend it against us.

The tragedy with these debates-it is like talking about apartheid in South Africa-is that if you do not take one position, you are 100 per cent wrong. We are not arguing the rights and wrongs of the people in the dining room and we are not arguing about the decision that was made yesterday, we are arguing about the capacity to move freely in and out of this Parliament. If it were a bunch of truck drivers who were angry about the decisions that the Government was making on their licence fees, after a day or so their trucks would be dragged away and they would be dragged away with them. This bunch has become nothing more than an illegal lobby group.

       I do not mind the fact that three-quarters of honourable senators opposite are here because they got the nod and the wink from the union movement that agreed to their endorsements. I do not mind them standing up and offering robust arguments on the unions' behalf. But if sitting there looking stupid and giggly, and whispering trite comments to each other goes to make up substantial intellectual debate, I have to say that the sooner they lose government the better.

        â€”In the contribution I made on this subject last evening, I made the point that the dispute that has caused these picket lines would not be resolved in this chamber, in the other place or, indeed, within the Parliament itself. The contributions that I have heard this evening, with a few exceptions, endorse my view that I was accurate in what I said last evening.

       The dispute will be solved when all parties to it sit down and work out a settlement. In that, Mr President, I wish you all the luck in the world and the wisdom of Solomon so that you will fulfil your role-as I know you will-to bring about an early solution to the dispute that is causing the problems at the moment. There are problems for honourable senators-there is no question that there is minor inconvenience to us. It is not the first time that we have suffered minor inconvenience in getting into this place to do our jobs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Like every other senator in the place, yesterday morning I had to walk in from Melbourne Avenue and last night I had to walk out to Melbourne Avenue. This morning it proved to be a costly exercise for me as I walked in from Melbourne Avenue where the picket line is set up, because I was carrying my lunch-I had just been to the delicatessen-and, unfortunately, chocolate biscuits were on the top. I was encouraged to share the chocolate biscuits with the picketers-people who had served me my meals in this place. I had no problems in sharing with them or in exercising empathy with them. It is not the first picket line that I have ever been associated with and it will not be the last.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mention was made earlier that some of us are crying crocodile tears over the plight that these people find themselves in. I am certainly not one of the people crying crocodile tears. I empathise with their position because I have been there myself-I have been made redundant-and I know the fear that runs through people's hearts when they know they have dependants for whom they have to provide. They cannot run back to their farms and undertake other occupations or live on savings because few of the people have any savings that will matter or that amount to much. One has to have been there to understand what is now going through the minds of these people.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not intend to go on for too long in this contribution. The point has been made about the inconvenience and the right of people to protest. I said earlier that it is not the first time we have suffered this interference. Not so very long ago when the weather was warm-and I stress that point-the whole of Parliament House was encircled by huge trucks. They blocked access to the Parliament-to the Senate entrance, the ministerial entrance, the Representatives entrance and the main entrance. We had to walk to get inside, but it was a joy to us because the weather was warm. Opposition senators are like the football supporters who support the home team when they are winning but cannot stand it when they are losing on a wet day. I had no problems in getting out of the car and walking into Parliament House because I supported the rights of the truckies to protest.
      </para>
      <para>
       We also had the motorcyclists not so very long ago. They are beautiful people, every one of them. They came here with their protest about lights. They encircled the Parliament and gave us the noise as well as the beauty of their machines and personalities. They actually blocked the entrances. I was one of the people who had to walk a short distance. There was no problem; they had a right to protest. They were not damaging my person in any shape or form. They were inconveniencing me, but they were not hurting the Parliament.

       Where were the screams from those opposite on those two instances when the Parliament was being threatened because we could not get to our jobs? The weather was warm. Maybe that was the reason there were no screams from the other side. Another incident I recall very vividly involved the farmers.

In the comparison they made, part of Senator McKiernan's speech was rubbish and all of Senator McLean's speech was rubbish.

       When I was listening to this debate in my office, I was annoyed to hear Senator McLean compare this protest and blockade with that of the loggers. Senator McLean and Senator McKiernan know as well as I do that the trucks blockaded nobody. Everyone was able to come and go at their will and they were not stopped at all. The loggers were peaceful and caused no trouble at all; they definitely did not stop mail coming in; they did not stop supplies to the dining room; they did not stop stationery supplies to any offices, or anything of that sort. Yet we have had Senators McKiernan and McLean comparing them with those picketers. It is a total disgrace to compare the picketers with the loggers' peaceful demonstration. Getting onto where I agree with Senator McKiernan, I respect the right of the picketers to protest. I support them 100 per cent to do what they want, but that does not give them the right to hold up the traffic going in and out of Parliament House. That is the difference between the loggers and the people out there at present.

To compare with a lobby group the workers who are legitimately on strike and picketing-I emphasise the word `legitimately', because I understand that a number of workers today did go on strike and left this building-is absolutely ridiculous.

       They are taking legitimate industrial action and they are picketing. That is not illegal in this country-not yet, anyway-at least until those opposite become the government, if they ever do. It is not illegal to picket and it is not illegal to strike. The logging trucks that were here were illegally parked. For some time they were blocking the traffic and they were certainly illegally parked. We did not hear cries from those opposite that those trucks were illegally parked or demands of the President to have them hauled away.

       We did not hear any comment at all about those trucks being illegally parked. It is quite clear that they were illegally parked.

For the record, I simply point out that most of the issues I raised last night were raised in writing with both the President and the Speaker when I became aware that the catering service was to be contracted out. I think I did that on 18 June. So I did inform the President and the Speaker of my concerns that I believed might arise, and unfortunately have arisen, because of this dispute.

However, there are some basic issues I must quickly refer to since Senator Hill referred to them. The issue was raised whether all the people have been paid who are supposed to have been paid. The union is saying that they have not. Another issue raised was whether they have been paid the correct amount. The union is saying that they have not. Those are two of the issues raised at the meeting this afternoon. I think you will all want Mr Speaker and I to seek advice to try to find out the correct situation.

        As I have said, we are in a difficult situation. I do not believe at this stage that the operations of the Parliament are being severely disrupted. The discussions that Mr Speaker and I are having with our officers and with the unions will continue tonight and into tomorrow. I hope to be able to make a statement tomorrow afternoon. However, I must say at this stage that I am not confident that the pickets will be lifted at that stage.

         â€”On 8 November 1990 in a short adjournment speech I referred to a quest by Sonia Turkington of Como in Western Australia regarding Italian detainees during World War II whereby she was seeking recognition, some sort of reconciliation and function, for what had been done to them. That evening I was supported by Senator Macdonald, whom I hardly knew at the time-he had just come into the Senate-and later on Senator Robert Ray gave me some encouragement. I also gave a notice of motion, which was later declared formal and carried, concerning reconciliation towards those internees. The matter was also raised in the House of Representatives by Dr Woods, supported by Mr Ruddock and Mr Noel Hicks from the conservatives' side and Mr Sciacca, Mr Ronald Edwards and Mrs Crosio from the Government side.

        Mrs Turkington pressed on with her reconciliation dinner. After this motion went through the Federal Parliament she asked the Western Australian Government to host that reconciliation dinner, which it did. The dinner was held on 8 August this year; it was attended by 67 internees and with their wives the number of people who sat down to dinner totalled 130. The dinner was attended and addressed by the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence; at least five other members of parliament, including Mr Con Sciacca-who travelled all the way from Queensland-attended it, as I did. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sent a letter which was read out during the dinner. I have not shown the letter to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) who is present in the chamber, but at this stage I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.

        I am proud to state that your mistaken internment in the 1940s was based on community attitudes of the time and would not occur in the multicultural Australia of 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the firm policy of my Government to acknowledge and promote cultural diversity, and to maintain harmony between all ethnic groups. Experiences such as yours as internees, strengthened by the good will which you have consistently shown to a nation which was at the time much less welcoming, have helped Australians develop a much more mature and sophisticated attitude to our multicultural society.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is aware of the important contribution of our large and well established Italian community to Australia's economic and cultural growth. As a nation, we are particularly conscious of how much we owe to the hard work and determination of Italian migrants and their children. In such diverse areas as business, community service, language, education and sport, the energy and enterprise of the Italian community has played a major role in shaping our unique multicultural society.
       </para>
       <para>
        The entrepreneurial skills and vigour of Italian Australians have major importance for all of us. Your community has also been outstanding for its determination and self reliance in building a new life in a new environment. This is a record of which you can be proud.
       </para>
       <para>
        Your strong combined will to survive and prosper has made it possible for so many of you to meet again, 50 years on-this is a magnificent achievement. I hope that you all have an enjoyable time at this Reconciliation Dinner and I wish you and your descendants all the very best for the future. Australia is proud of you.

         â€”I thank the Senate. The reconciliation dinner was a very successful function. I could detect no bitterness about something which happened just over 50 years ago among the 130 people who attended that dinner. However, I wish to put on the record my thanks for the support I received from all parties in this chamber and in the other place. Of course, I also wish to thank the Western Australian Government, which I seldom do, and any other groups or people who contributed to the successful reconciliation function achieved that night.

        One thing is still outstanding from my formal motion; that is, that a notation should be put on the files of these internees. After 30 or 40 years-I do not know exactly how long-the files kept on these internees were made open to the public. One of Mrs Turkington's first concerns after she had exercised her right to examine her father's file was that it contained some statements that she considered were not totally correct and had not been corroborated or backed up by someone. That was her primary concern; certainly it is still my primary concern. I picked out the files of people I know very well and examined them, and I am sure that a lot of the accusations they contain were not true. However, those accusations remain on the files and I think it is totally unfair that when those files become available to future generations-to grandchildren or great-grandchildren-they will think that their ancestors were criminals and were locked up for nearly five years when their only crime was to be of Italian origin in Australia at that time. I call on the Government to look at the idea of making notations to those files because the conclusions on them are not necessarily correct.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I would like to record the contribution made by Sonia Turkington of Como in Western Australia and her drive and tenacity to get this reconciliation dinner under way. As I said, it was only on 8 November last year that I raised this matter in this chamber and she had written to me on 26 October. Hopefully this sort of function will be repeated in other States.

         â€”It is one of the ironies-and a very sad irony indeed-of a recession that at a time when people's need is greatest the amount of money available to alleviate their need is perhaps least. This is no less so in the case of the young. Tonight I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time to give my recognition and appreciation to a great bunch of Australians who have done their bit to alleviate the need and the particular disadvantages of young people in far north Queensland.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have spoken in the Senate before about the particular needs of people in Cairns, about how in Cairns there is a very high number of single parent families and that this has caused all sorts of difficulties because parents do shift work and there is nobody at home to look after the children. This has led to the highest youth crime rate in Queensland, where 56 per cent of all crime committed in Cairns is committed by juveniles. We believe that this year the arrest rate in Cairns for juveniles will be 28 per cent-that is, almost one in three people arrested in Cairns for crime will be under the age of 18 years. Any reasonable person looking at these statistics would say that there is a major problem in Cairns and something must be done about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the efforts to alleviate this problem is being made by the Police Citizens Youth Club. A group of people is endeavouring to put together a hall so that young people can be involved in activities, be given assistance, be given day care and be out of potentially bad influences. It is but one effort to cut down the high rate of juvenile crime. But there is a problem because, in spite of the need, and in spite of the undoubted valuable contribution that the Police Citizens Youth Club is making to these young people in Cairns, there has not been enough money to fund that club. So during the recess I went with the chairman of the Police Citizens Youth Club, who happens to be even younger than me--

We visited some 20 national companies around Australia which operate in the Cairns area and asked them to contribute to the community in which they operate. There were many instances where those companies said that they wanted to make a contribution, that they were strapped for cash but would give goods or services, or whatever.

        But I rise to record a donation that was made by Placer Dome Mining, which operates a number of mines in north Queensland, Western Australia and Papua New Guinea. In spite of the fact that it had a very depressed gold price and the Kidston goldmine profits had fallen quite considerably, when we went to the company's offices in Sydney we were told, `We are going to give you some money. How much do you want?'. We said, `How much money can you give?'. We discussed it at length and were told that the company was very committed to what we were doing and would give us some money. By the time we got back to Cairns a cheque for $15,000 was sitting on Grant Cassidy's desk.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such action renews my faith in mankind. It renews my faith in the generosity of private individuals around this country. At a time when so many people seem to be saying so many negative things about Australia, if only we had more people like the good people of Placer Dome Mining who are willing to fork out of their own pocket for what they know is right, many of the problems that this nation faces would not be as difficult as they appear today. I am very grateful to Bill Hundy, John Shaw, Alf Paton and everybody else at Placer Dome Mining for their contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amount of $15,000 will not build the Police Citizens Youth Club hall but it goes a long way towards our raising the money that we need and, more importantly, it is a sign to everybody that the corporate sector and private individuals have to do their bit. If Placer Dome Mining can do it, so can many other companies. I encourage those people who may be listening and who may read these comments to recognise that a community is only a community if it pulls together. As I said, with more companies such as Placer Dome Mining, our communities would be better still.

         â€”I want to take a few minutes of the Senate's time tonight to progress a little on the matter I raised today in debate under Government documents relating to the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Today I drew the Senate's attention to the fact that the Advance to the Minister for Finance had been used in June to make a payment of $2m to the Government of Queensland to meet an undertaking that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-apparently without any backing from his Cabinet, and in a unilateral action-had made in March of this year for Commonwealth assistance for infrastructure restoration following the recent natural disasters experienced by the State. I drew attention to aspects of that today.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”As my colleague Senator Michael Baume says, instead of the standover tactics that appear to have been used by the Prime Minister in this instance earlier this year. To refresh the Senate's memory, on 8 May of this year the Prime Minister wrote to the former Treasurer drawing his attention to a letter that the Prime Minister had written to the Premier of Queensland on 13 March on this matter of Commonwealth assistance for infrastructure restoration. Although that letter was not tabled today with the other documents relating to the Advance to the Minister for Finance, it is clear from the Prime Minister's letter to the former Treasurer that the Prime Minister had committed a payment of $2m to Queensland for infrastructure restoration in each of 1990-91 and 1991-92. He requested of the former Treasurer that that be done by way of an Advance to the Minister for Finance under the Treasury appropriation because it related to Commonwealth payments to the States.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not know whether the Prime Minister thought he was going to get a better or more gracious response and acceptance of his letter from the former Treasurer because of the fact that he crossed out the words `My dear Treasurer' and wrote in `Dear Paul'. The net effect was that as a result of the letter from the Prime Minister, the former Treasurer-he obviously did not know anything about it at the time; it was prior to the receipt of the letter-then wrote to the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, on 29 May drawing attention to the fact that the Prime Minister had recently written to the former Treasurer concerning a commitment the Prime Minister had entered into on behalf of the Commonwealth to pay a capital grant to Queensland of $2m in each of the two years to which I have already referred.
       </para>
       <para>
        The former Treasurer, again in his letter to the Minister for Finance, pointed out that the Prime Minister's letter specifically indicated that the payment for 1990-91 should be by way of an Advance to the Minister for Finance. He then went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand (following consultation on this matter between our officers) that your approval for the payment to be made in this way, in writing and in response to my request, is necessary by virtue of Finance Regulations 44b. In view of the Prime Minister's specific request, I would be grateful if you would give the necessary approval.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite obvious from that letter that the Treasurer was not too keen on this at all, but he had been backed into a corner by the Prime Minister and he could see no easy way out of it. Subsequently, on 7 June the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, wrote back to by that time a new Treasurer, Mr Kerin, replying to Mr Keating's letter of 29 May. In his letter of 7 June Mr Willis said he understood that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Prime Minister has informed the Premier of Queensland that, in view of the impact of successive natural disasters on the State budget, the Commonwealth will provide additional assistance of $2 million in 1990-91. This commitment was made after the Additional Estimates Bills for 1990-91 had been finalised.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then went on to say that he supported the proposal to provide the additional money. He then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that an application for funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance will be forwarded to my department shortly for processing in the usual way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The significance of this is that the Prime Minister entered into a commitment, apparently without the approval of his Cabinet, to pay money to Queensland and to do it by way of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, without having sought to follow in any way the proper procedures that it is necessary to follow in order to obtain money from the Advance to the Minister for Finance.
       </para>
       <para>
        That Advance is supposed to be used for unforeseen and urgent circumstances. According to the correspondence tabled today in the Senate, the Prime Minister gave that commitment to the Premier of Queensland on 13 March. Apparently, he did not write to the Treasurer-let alone to the Minister for Finance, who of course is responsible for the Advance to the Minister for Finance-until 8 May. That was almost two months after he had made that commitment to the Premier of Queensland. It then took another month or so to action. Indeed, the commitment and the approvals to use the Advance to the Minister for Finance were given before any application had been made to the Minister for Finance for the payment of those funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have had considerable debates in this chamber, in Senate Estimates committees and in other committees associated with the Senate-including the Joint Committee on Public Accounts-over recent times about the propriety of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. We on this side of the chamber have drawn attention time and time again to this Government's quite improper use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance to make payments, particularly to State governments and particularly to State Labor governments, for purposes which are never, ever perceived to be the proper purpose of the Advance to the Minister for Finance.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the reasons why that has been done is undoubtedly that using the method of the Advance to the Minister for Finance very largely disguises the fact that the payment has been made. It comes to light only after the event and it normally only comes to light buried in a huge mass of papers which may be tabled in the Parliament, or subsequently buried in some of the background papers to the Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        But that is all after the event. It is not subject to the normal appropriation processes that a Budget has, whereby the expenditure is scrutinised before it is approved by the Parliament. All we are doing by using the Advance to the Minister for Finance is allowing the Parliament to see what has happened after the money has been committed and actually paid out. It is done in a very hidden, secretive way.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am delighted to see that-as a result of the Opposition's pressure in relation to this matter, the attention it has drawn to this matter in recent times and, no doubt, importantly, the quite flagrant breach of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance which the payment to Queensland that I have outlined tonight exemplifies-the Department of Finance on 25 July issued a new statement on the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the guidelines to be applied to it. That was in the form of Estimates Memorandum 1991/24. I seek leave to have the memorandum incorporated in Hansard.

        ADVANCE TO THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE (AMF)-GUIDELINES

        Guidelines for the use of AMF were originally issued in September 1988 as Estimates Memorandum 1988/29.

Only those applications which conform with the attached pro-forma will be processed.

       <para>
        2. Application for funds from AMF must be made in advance of the requirement for those funds, and there should be no presumption on the part of departments and agencies that applications will be approved by the Minister for Finance's delegate. It is the responsibility of departments to ensure that expenditure does not exceed appropriation at any time. Finance Circular 1991/12 of 8 April 1991 also addresses this issue.

        3. The delegate may request additional information in order to be satisfied that the requirements set out in the Appropriation Acts and the Guidelines have been met. This may cause delays in the processing of applications. To avoid this, departments should ensure that the Guidelines are strictly adhered to, and that adequate explanatory material is provided. Details of all issues from AMF are provided to the Parliament on a monthly basis, together with supporting applications. As a result of recent Senate Estimates Committee hearings, information relating to unsuccessful applications will, from 1 July 1991, also be collected on a trial basis for later provision to Parliament, if required.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Application for funds from AMF must be made in advance of the requirement for those funds, and there should be no presumption on the part of departments and agencies that applications will be approved by the Minister for Finance's delegate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, if those guidelines had applied before the example of the payment to Queensland that I mentioned, the Prime Minister would have been even more in breach of the proprieties of the Advance to the Minister for Finance than he was. I congratulate the Department of Finance on at least making this step, which should, hopefully, at least go some way to reducing the quite flagrant breaches of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance that have been occurring increasingly over the life of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        On behalf of the Opposition, I can assure the Senate and the Government that we will be continuing to monitor this matter very closely indeed. It goes to the heart of the propriety of government in the use of public moneys. I welcome the guidelines and put the Government on notice that we are going to be very diligent indeed in ensuring that those guidelines are followed.

         â€”I make two very brief points. Firstly, I commend Senator Short's remarks and say to the people of Australia that, if they get worried about the fact that sometimes the bureaucratic machine takes a long time to work for them, they should just note that it took the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) three months to get his will eventually implemented. He wrote on 13 March, promising the money to Mr Goss, apparently, and Mr Goss did not get it until after 7 June, despite `Dear Paul' letters and all the other paraphernalia. Maybe a lot of us should not feel too bad. I wonder what the relationship was between the Prime Minister and Mr Keating at that stage. I notice that the letter from the Prime Minister, dated 8 May, was not acted on by the Treasurer until 29 May. That seems quite a long time for the Treasurer to act in response to a `Dear Paul' request from the Prime Minister.

         â€”The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, who no doubt has many relations of perhaps a less than satisfactory nature with the former Treasurer, says that, relatively, that is lightning fast. That may be so. However, it obviously did not satisfy the Prime Minister, who was massively underwhelmed by the fact that after two months nothing had happened about his request. It took another three weeks for the former Treasurer to do anything about it. The day after he did something about it, he took action against the Prime Minister. Maybe this was the straw that broke his back.

       <para>
        What I wanted to say is that I have a solution to our transport problems in view of the present industrial situation. Some people in Canberra-Senator McMullan, for example-have cars and can drive themselves to the Parliament. Obviously, all that needs to happen is that a car pool system be introduced. The reason I suggest that is that, if such a pool were introduced, no doubt Senator Richardson would give us a $20,000 government grant to assist us in that venture.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the period when Senator Richardson was Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories he said in response to a question from Senator Walsh that he provided to the Flinders University conservation group a $20,000 grant to establish a viable car pooling system which, apart from educating the public in the importance of reducing the use of motor vehicles, was a step towards minimising the emission of greenhouse gases. All I can suggest is that we could do our bit to reduce greenhouse gases. All we need is a $20,000 grant from the Government. We could solve all the problems of the blockades here. No doubt Senator McMullan and I could spend the money quite well.

      <para>
       (1) Has the Department considered the effectiveness of direct marketing? If so, please provide details of: (a) the areas in which the Department believes direct marketing will be of most use to it; (b) the results it would hope to achieve from direct marketing; and (c) the types of direct marketing methods considered most relevant and effective for the Department's purposes, for example, direct mail, telephone canvassing or other forms of direct marketing.

        â€”-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Most program areas of the Department engage in some form of direct marketing - by targeting specific industry groups to receive relevant information specially tailored to that group. This saves on the cost of dissemination of information and enables the Department to best design its information to achieve maximum effect with the specific target audience.
      </para>
      <para>
       My Department also engages in direct marketing in its broad sense through a flagship magazine, Ascent Technology Magazine, and through various specialist publications targeted to specific audiences. A number of areas in the Department use mailing lists of clients, such as industry associations, companies, educational institutions, trade unions, scientific and research organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       In April the Department surveyed readers of Ascent Technology Magazine to find out needs for information on its programs. To date, more than 1,000 responses, expressing predominantly positive views, have been received. Media releases are also targeted to specific media and specialist writers to achieve maximum impact.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Department does not separately identify direct marketing as a budget item within its program allocations. Annual expenditure on Ascent Technology Magazine and other such publications is not sufficient to warrant the creation of a separate item within the Department's appropriation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Corporate Communications Branch uses a database of 16 000 entries for mailing the bi- monthly Ascent Technology Magazine to industry organisations and individuals.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) In accordance with its mission of developing and supporting sustainable international competitiveness throughout the manufacturing and service sectors, the Department continuously disseminates information through the mail about its activities. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, the Department mailed the March Industry Statement, `Building a Competitive Australia', to 10,000 entries from its mailing list including industry associations, trade union companies, educational institutions and individuals.

The acquittal date varies depending on the completion date of the project for which the recipient has been funded. These processes are audited by both the Australia Council's internal auditors and the Australian National Audit Office. Grants worth $218,315 in total are still in the process of being acquitted for 1989-90. It is too early to assess overdue acquittals for grants paid in 1990-91.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) While there may well be US legislation applicable to US military activities in the United States and overseas, so far as the Australian Government is concerned the relevant environmental standards governing the activities of US military personnel in Australia are defined in Australian legislation. This is provided for in a Status of Forces Agreement between the Australian and United States Governments (Australian Treaty Series 1963 No. 10). Article 13 provides that the United States Government shall conform to relevant Commonwealth and State laws and regulations, and that United States personnel shall observe those laws and regulations. These include environmental laws and regulations. Our agreements with the United States regarding the operation of the Joint Defence Facilities make provision for this situation to apply also at the Joint Defence Facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The obligations of the US Government under the Status of Forces Agreement and arrangements governing the Joint Defence Facilities remain undiminished by any domestic United States procedural obligation on the US Department of Defense to make available compliance notices to Congress.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) There are no US military sites currently in Australia and there have not been any for very many years. In view of the costs and other resources involved in researching any records that might still be available on any historical sites, such as those used by United States forces in the defence of Australia in the Second World War, I am not prepared to authorise the work necessary to provide a detailed response.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government acknowledges, however, that numerous areas throughout Australia are or may be affected by unexploded ordnance as a result of wartime training and testing activities by both Australian and allied military forces. The Department of Defence has for some years been working to identify these areas and the nature and extent of the unexploded ordnance problem there.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force are responsible for the disposal or rendering safe of any explosives or ammunition of military origin. This is provided for in a national policy for the management of land affected by unexploded ordnance as a result of military activities. The policy also imposes on Defence certain responsibilities for the management of land affected by unexploded ordnance. These responsibilities are primarily aimed at protecting members of the public from the hazards associated with such ordnance.
      </para>
      <para>
       In November 1990, the Prime Minister wrote to the State Premiers and Territory Chief Ministers to inform them of the Government's policy and to affirm the Commonwealth's long standing commitment to make specialist Defence personnel available on request to render safe any items of unexploded ordnance which might be discovered.

       (1) Is it a fact that, according to a September 1990 paper produced for the Uranium Institute by a departmental officer, Mr R.G. Crick, under current policy guidelines, Australia's annual uranium production capacity could be increased to 10 000t/y subject to market availability, that is, 6000t/y at Ranger and 4000t/y at Olympic Dam, without opening any more mines.

      <para>
       (3) Does the Minister accept the view that, if Australia cannot even get a guaranteed market for its current output of uranium, and that further mining in the Kakadu region would have a negative environmental impact, then there is no argument for opening more uranium mines.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. The paper presented by Mr Crick to the Fifteenth Annual Symposium of the Uranium Institute was entitled `Australian Uranium and Nuclear Policy'. The paper included the assessment that, by the late 1990s, annual production capacity from existing Australian uranium mines could be increased to 10,000 tonnes U(3)O(8) within current policy guidelines, subject to market availability.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Some environmental groups would seem to take the view that Australia's future market potential could be satisfied by expanding output from existing uranium mines rather than by opening new mines.
      </para>
      <para>
       Such an approach, however, does not appreciate the way the uranium market operates or the extent of future market opportunities for uranium. In reality, market participants would not enter into contracts to a mine's maximum nominal capacity. Moreover, for reasons of energy security, major utilities seek diversity of supply, not only geographically, but among different projects within a country. They would be cautious about the extent to which they were committed to any one project.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The world uranium market is currently adjusting to past oversupply and excess of available stocks. This has led to cutbacks in production around the world, including the closure overseas of some higher cost mines. Although Australian producers have also felt the effects of the depressed state of the market, Australia has retained a significant and assured market for its uranium.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1990 Australia produced 4,163 tonnes U(3)O(8) and exported 7,442 tonnes U(3)O(8). Exports comprised 2,900 tonnes from the sale of the Nabarlek stockpile and 4,542 tonnes from sales by the existing producers under long term contracts. As recently as over the past twelve months, Australian producers have signed new, long-term contracts with utilities in Asia, Europe and the United States. Market opportunities will expand over the coming years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The government has in place comprehensive environmental requirements, regulations, and monitoring arrangements relating to uranium mining in the Kakadu region. In relation to the existing mine there, the Supervising Scientist has attested to the high level of environmental protection which has been achieved.

       (1) Is it a fact that, according to a Department of Primary Industries and Energy officer, Mr R. G.

      <para>
       (3) Is it a fact that the environment group, FOE, has claimed in a widely circulated submission made in 1990 to the International Atomic Energy Commission and the ALP Uranium Policy Review Committee that, if nuclear capacity estimates made by NUKEM of 326.6Gwe for the year 2000 are taken and all reactors not currently under construction are removed from this estimate, a reasonable step in view of construction lead-time, and post Chernobyl uncertainties, we will derive FOE's number of 302-304Gwe for nuclear capacity in the year 2000.

       (4) Is it a fact that, by removing from our calculations the 50Gwe that NUKEM says is not yet under construction from the 348Gwe NUKEM says will be in operation by the year 2005, we obtain the even lower number of 298Gwe for nuclear capacity by that year.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The paper given by Mr Crick of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to the Uranium Institute symposium in 1990 estimated that WOCA nuclear generating capacity in the year 2000 would be 320 GWe. This was contrasted with Greenpeace's estimate of 310 GWe and other estimates from industry ranging from 326 GWE to 330 GWe.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Forecasts of western world nuclear generating capacity for the year 2000 are based, for the most part, on reactors that are operating, under construction, or firmly planned. Variations in estimates arise because of different judgments about rates of construction and, in some cases, about public acceptance and government approvals. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, not surprisingly, take a conservative approach to the rate of growth of the nuclear industry. The estimate of 320 GWe, contained in the paper referred to in the first part of the question, reflects a realistic appraisal of government and industry processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) The claims attributed to the FOE submissions, as indicated in the questions, are based on the assumption that no reactor, not currently under construction, will be completed before 2005. While it is reasonable to expect that there could be approval problems and construction delays in a number of cases, the fact that approval and construction processes, in some countries, are currently continuing suggests that the validity of the FOE assumption is questionable.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The letter of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to the ALP uranium policy review committee did not claim that the nuclear power industry will undergo a rapid expansion post 1995. It suggested that there would be a significant upturn in the world uranium market from about the middle of the 1990s. This view is based on an analysis of both reactor-related uranium demand and uranium production and other supply trends. (See also the answers to questions 930 and 932).

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) All uranium market analysts, including those opposed to uranium mining, agree that western world nuclear generating capacity will grow in the period between now and the year 2000. There is general agreement about growth rates to 1995, but there are more substantial variations in estimates of the pace of growth beyond that.
      </para>

       The basic fact is that nuclear generating capacity is expanding, not contracting. This growth, coupled with draw-down of excess inventories accumulated in the expectation of more rapid growth in the 1980s, signals a significant improvement in the market outlook for uranium in the second half of this decade.

      <para>
       (1) Regular members are provided with disability/invalidity cover as shown in the following Table 1.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Reserve members are provided with disability/invalidity cover as shown in the following Tables 2 and 3. Members called out under sections 50E and 5OF of the Defence Act are required to render continuous full time service and are thus provided with benefits listed in Table 3.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In relation to the Ready Reserve disability provisions will be exactly the same as for normal reserve members. That is while on reserve service they attract the benefits at Table 2. When on continuous full time service they attract the benefits of Table 3.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Commonwealth does not provide disability insurance to cover the private business expenses of its employees. Some reserve members did attempt to obtain such cover privately prior to deployment to the Gulf. In the circumstances insurance companies were not prepared to underwrite new policies for such insurance, while some companies stated an intention to invoke a war clause to deny liability in the event of injury or death in the Gulf.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The first contingent of reservists to serve on the USNS COMFORT deployed in September 1990. Following representations in early November concerning the perceived inadequacy of the level of disability cover (provided under the Veterans' Entitlements Act (VEA)) the Government agreed that as an Act of Grace, in the event of injury or death, reservists serving in the Gulf would be provided with invalidity and death cover as if they had been members of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) scheme. The benefit was non-contributory though the regular member is required to contribute to DFRDB to obtain the same benefits. In addition a new provision was introduced for the reimbursement to reservists of any excess premium payable on invalidity insurance policies by virtue of service in the Gulf. No such provision exists for regular members. Members were informed of these initiatives in December 1990 prior to the departure of the second deployment to USNS COMFORT. Given the range of policy considerations which had to be addressed I consider the delay in finalising these matters was reasonable.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Government has received submissions from reservists who claim they are suffering financially from their service in the Gulf.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) With the introduction of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS) in October 1991, reservists who serve in an operational area described in the VEA will be able to contribute to and obtain the invalidity benefits of that scheme. Normal VEA operational service provisions will of course apply.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Civil Aviation Authority on 3 June 1991 invited registration of interest in a project to modernise the Australian air traffic system.  The project, among other things, will consolidate the provision of air traffic services, to the greatest extent possible, into two new major Air Traffic Service Centres to be located in Brisbane and Melbourne. The modernisation program is known as the Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS) and has a target date for commissioning of December 1995.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Six companies have been invited to register interest:
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       Thomson Radar Australia Corporation Pty Ltd
      </para>
      <para>
       The response period for registrations of interest closes on Monday 22 July 1991 for technical descriptions and Monday 29 July 1991 for price information.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No companies have yet registered an interest. IBM Australia, NEC Information Systems Australia and Thomson Radar Australia were invited to register an interest. However, no Australian parent company was invited to register an interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The approach chosen by the CAA of restricting invitations to companies that have demonstrated success in the implementation and integration of complete air traffic systems does not preclude opportunities for Australian industry. The CAA considered that no Australian firm met their qualifications, but the prime contractor chosen will be obliged to comply with Australian Government policies regarding offsets and Australian and New Zealand industry preference. The CAA will also require that a support capability for the selected system is available or established in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The high cost and schedule risks associated with development and implementation of air traffic control technology are well known. Cost overruns of billions of dollars have occurred on major projects. Therefore, it is no surprise that the CAA has chosen to minimise its risks by adopting a 'turnkey' approach. By seeking proven systems and inviting interest only from organisations which have demonstrated success in the implementation, integration and commissioning of complete air traffic systems, the CAA has adopted a low risk approach significantly reducing the potential for large cost and schedule overruns.
      </para>
      <para>
       The CAA made a presentation to a large group of representatives of Australian industry in Canberra on 5 June 1991. At the meeting, the CAA provided Australian industry representatives with copies of functional specifications distributed to potential prime contractors, thus enabling local industry to assess potential areas of future involvement in follow up discussions with potential prime contractors.
      </para>
      <para>
       In this regard, a group of Australian companies has now registered an interest with certain of the overseas companies on the CAA's prime contractor list.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The CAA does not discourage Australian firms from tendering for projects.  However, the CAA is a government business enterprise seeking to operate more efficiently and reduce costs to the aviation industry, without compromising safety standards.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. The Defence Housing Authority (DHA) believes that its first priority is to the Service families occupying the houses it provides.  In order to avoid disruption to families, the DHA would, ideally, like to provide assured tenure for the term of a Service member's posting to a particular posting locality. Although this may not always be possible when the dwelling has been leased, a no release clause at least gives security for the period of the lease.

However, both Defence and DHA ensure that members are informed of the implications of being posted back to the locality of their own home before the expiration of their leases.

       (2) Living Out Allowance is paid to meet a member's reasonable living costs in respect of accommodation, food, utilities and laundry when suitable Service quarters can not be provided. As these costs vary according to the posting locality the Allowance is not paid at a set rate. Payment is of reasonable costs up to a locally set ceiling. Evidence of the costs incurred is required prior to calculation of the amount of Living Out Allowance a member is to receive and this payment is regularly reviewed by the approving authority. Members in receipt of this allowance are required to contribute an amount for board and lodgings known as the rations and quarters charge as if they were living in service accommodation.

       In practice, however, there would be problems in bringing Saddam Hussein to trial. There is no existing international tribunal which could try him, and it is difficult to see how he could be brought before any tribunal that might be constituted for the purpose without substantial international intervention in Iraq to apprehend him. The US Government has said that it would not use force to arrest him. We understand that, in the circumstances, it is not the intention of the UN to initiate war crimes proceedings against him.

The sanctions restrict all forms of trade and commerce with Iraq except for dealings in foodstuffs, medicines and materials for essential civilian needs. In addition, Security Council Resolution 700 of 17 June 1991 reinforces the provisions of SCR 687 relating to the prohibition on the sale or supply of arms and defence- related supplies to Iraq.

        â€”-On 21 June 1991 (Hansard, page 5327), Senator Watson asked me a question without notice concerning the eligibility of students at private tertiary education institutions to receive Austudy. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The tertiary courses approved for AUSTUDY are the bulk of courses at TAFE colleges and higher education institutions. Up to the end of 1990 it was a requirement for AUSTUDY approval that courses be government funded. The only private tertiary education institutions with courses approved for AUSTUDY in 1990 were private business colleges which had received a States Grants fees subsidy (phased out in 1989); Avondale, Signadou and Macauley Colleges which received States Grants funding in respect of teacher education courses; and Marcus Oldham Farm Management College which received States Grants funding in respect of a Diploma of Farm Management.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 1990 Budget the Government decided to extend AUSTUDY to other private business colleges in 1991. The further courses which have been approved for AUSTUDY this year are secretarial courses accredited by a reputable accrediting authority. The courses are similar in nature to those which were approved for AUSTUDY in 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 1991 Budget the Government will be considering the possibility of further extension of AUSTUDY for privately provided courses. A requirement for approval would be accreditation by the relevant State or Territory accrediting authority.
