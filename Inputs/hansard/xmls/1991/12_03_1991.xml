        <para in-line="1">
         —Yes, I am certainly aware of this difficulty. As I have pointed out on a number of occasions, one of the great differences between Australia and, for example, New Zealand and the United Kingdom-to whom we are often compared-is that we have a federal system of government which has strict demarcation lines in responsibility between the Federal government and the State governments. Of course, whatever amount of reform the Commonwealth can deliver on the waterfront can be matched, according to the Inter-State Commission report, by the reform that is needed in the operations of the ports, which of course are State government responsibilities.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is also a serious problem with the interface between the wharf and the land transport system, either road or rail. That matter is in hand in some of the agreements that are being progressed. For example, the National Terminals (Australia) Ltd agreement-much criticised-provides for a turnaround time of 30 minutes for trucks by providing a continuous discharge and receival cargo arrangement at its terminal and an earlier start-up time for the terminal to cope with the early peak period of demand for trucks. National Terminals also proposes to introduce some enhanced computer operations, directly aimed at reducing the truck turnaround time problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        To sum up, there are three outstanding areas that will need urgent attention and which are currently getting it-and I hope I will be able to concentrate on them a lot more in the future when the stevedoring reform is accelerated. The first area is electronic data interchange (EDI), which has already had a very promising beginning in the industry and which has enormous potential. There are currently, in some situations, up to 100 paper transactions which have to take place in getting a container into and out of a port. That can be significantly enhanced by EDI, with great productivity gains.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area is the overhaul of the port operations themselves, which is principally a matter for the State governments but one which is being done in close cooperation with the Federal Government. A classic example of that cooperation is being exhibited currently in the port of Melbourne, and certainly in the States of Western Australia and Queensland which have recently completely overhauled their port authority structures, so a beginning has been made there.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third and remaining one, that raised by Senator Faulkner, is the question of the interface between the wharf and rail transport system. That is currently being addressed by a special committee headed by Peter Morris, a former Minister, who has a particular interest in this area. I conclude by urging all industry parties who want to see some improvements in this area to make submissions to that committee because I am working in close cooperation with it.

         —There has been considerable debate on this very question. Quite a number of the groups that represent the unemployed and attempt to look after their interests have argued strongly that there is no point in increasing training during times of recession when unemployment is going up and therefore immediate hopes to get jobs are very limited. I can understand the thinking in that point of view. However, the Government has taken the view that, even if unemployment is to rise or remain at high levels, we should not waste the opportunity to improve the skills base of the Australian work force. Accordingly, if Senator Alston can wait until this evening, he will see the results of those Government discussions. I think it would be inappropriate for me to announce them in advance of the statement.

In terms of why a change from then until now, there was always in the Government's program a very considerable upgrade in training for the unemployed. We are talking about a further effort caused by the fact that unemployment numbers have blown out since last October much more than we thought then. Consequently, the Government is reacting to it. I do not think that it is appropriate ever for a government to say that it will not react to changed circumstances. Circumstances have changed and, as usual, we are acting.

        <para in-line="1">
         —South Africa's return to international sporting competition took a very important further step over the weekend. Following a meeting of African and South African sports officials in Gaborone in Botswana, as Senator Schacht has said, an interim National Olympic Committee of South Africa-NOCSA-chaired by Sam Ramsamy, has now been established to assume the position of sole representative of all major sporting codes in South Africa. In that capacity NOCSA, the new organisation, will determine which sports have satisfied the requirement of non-racial unity, and then apply to the respective African and international controlling bodies to have sanctions lifted against those sports.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The first sporting body to affiliate with NOCSA is likely to be the new non-racial South African Football Association, SAFA-soccer, that is, rather than rugby, of course-which is to be officially launched in two weeks time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the new arrangements agreed at the weekend meeting, SAFA will then be able to apply for membership of the Confederation of African Football at its September meeting in Dakar. Cricket, on current indications, would follow within a similar timetable very shortly thereafter.
       </para>
       <para>
        These new arrangements have been approved by the African National Olympic Committees Association-ANOCA-whose President, Jean-Claude Ganga, attended the Gabarone meeting. These arrangements are expected to receive International Olympic Committee recognition when the senior delegation of IOC officials, including Kevan Gosper, visits South Africa later this month.
       </para>
       <para>
        This important step towards the normalisation of South African sport is in complete accord with the strategy proposed by Australia and mapped out at the London meeting of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa, which, as I have previously told the Senate, affirmed the Commonwealth's support and encouragement for the non-racial unification of sporting bodies, cleared the way for a selective easing of the sports boycott on a sport by sport basis, and placed control of and responsibility for this process back in the hands of the South African non-racial sporting bodies themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this respect I noticed-I could hardly help but notice, because Senator Baume has been so noisy about it-the concern previously expressed by some senators that the Commonwealth's sporting policy was being held to ransom by the African National Congress or by ANC-affiliated sports bodies. In fact, the ANC and its affiliated body, the National Olympic and Sports Congress-NSC-have been the catalysts for the change that I am now describing and applauding this afternoon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me emphasise, however, that NOCSA also consists not just of the ANC or ANC-affiliated bodies but of the two major white-run, establishment sports federations-the South Africa National Olympic Committee-SANOC-whose Chairman, Johan de Plessis, is now the General-Secretary of NOCSA, and the Confederation of South African Sport, or COSAS, which controls over 100 establishment sports organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, Australia will continue to monitor, encourage and support the normalisation of South African sport in accordance with the new Commonwealth policy, which I outlined in London last month.

         —It is a fact that last week the Government launched a report from the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which I believe sets a model for measuring the costs of all drug abuse in Australia. It was estimated in that report that tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs cost our community $14.3 billion. This is the value of resources which are unavailable to the community for consumption or investment as a result of past and present drug abuse. I suppose the more frightening statistic is that some 26,000 people die from direct drug use each year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The costs to the community include health care, lost productivity from death and disability of workers, welfare costs, law enforcement and loss of life. It is estimated that the private sector and industry lose at least $3.7 billion in direct costs from drug abuse each year. Quite clearly, it is not up to the Government alone to address this matter. We need employers and unions to cooperate on industry reform, workplace health and drug education to stop this drain on our economic productivity. I understand that my colleague in the other place, Mr Staples, will be addressing these issues in a conference on drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace in Melbourne in April this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tobacco and alcohol account for nearly $12.8 billion of the total cost to the community of the abuse of drugs throughout Australia. The Federal Government has taken significant steps in reducing tobacco and harmful alcohol consumption in Australia. We have banned direct advertising of tobacco on the electronic and print media, stopped smoking on domestic flights, interstate coaches and VIP flights and banned the sale of smokeless tobacco. In addition, there have been extensive education campaigns launched on smoking and alcohol abuse. Now the alcohol industry itself is ready to contribute to education campaigns and discuss broader issues such as advertising.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a fact that Australia has very large alcohol consumption compared with other Western countries. Drinking alcohol is part of our culture. It is vital that people practise safe consumption and remember that the National Health and Medical Research Council recommendation of two and four standard drinks per day for women and men is observed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The costs that Senator Colston mentioned of some $14.3 billion per year are horrendous. The Government will continue to take action on this front in cooperation with unions, industry and the community, not only to have economic gains but to better safeguard the health of all Australians.

         —I am delighted to get a dorothy dixer from the Opposition. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to correct this piece of nonsense, because Julian Manser has been widely misquoted. I am very pleased to have the opportunity because it simply confirms something I said five minutes ago. What Julian Manser said-and I am happy to send the honourable senator a copy of the speech, which was delivered in Sydney at a waterfront and shipping conference which I attended-was that the savings that will be achieved on the waterfront in the National Terminals agreement will not be passed on to users if those savings are simply eroded by increases in charges levied by State-controlled port authorities.
        </para>

       <para>
        That is what Julian Manser said. It has been misquoted by the National Farmers' Federation and by the Australia shippers users group, principally I would imagine because it was initially misquoted by John Sharp, along with all of the other nonsense he puts out. I agree with Julian Manser. As I said a few moments ago, the Inter-State Commission report clearly identified productivity gains to this country in the port authorities area equivalent to those that can be achieved on the waterfront. It is a fact that if the port authorities see the opportunity, because they are under State governments-I must say, that in State-Federal relations, it does not really matter much what complexion the government is, whether it is Labor or conservative-they will certainly take to get a few more dollars out of the Commonwealth by whichever means they can. If there is any attempt made to increase port charges to take up the opportunity that is created by the provision of those savings, indeed those savings will be eroded.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is extremely important that the State governments deliver on the question of State port reform. The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority have been deliberately involved by the Commonwealth in this exercise to make sure that the savings that will be gained on the waterfront with productivity increases in those enterprises will not simply be eroded away by some opportunistic action on the part of State controlled port authorities to increase their charges.

As Senator Reynolds quite rightly said, the Bureau has been in existence in one form or another for nearly 30 years and it has been recognised by the Government as having made a major contribution to improving women's participation in employment, education and training. However, I am advised that there is now a need to review arrangements for progressing women's issues in the portfolio. This need has been brought about because within a few months DEET will have in place for the first time national action plans in all major areas of the portfolio, covering higher education, technical and further education schools, and the Commonwealth Employment Service.

However, Mr Kerin has said that one will not know what the effect of that is-and it is therefore difficult to respond to it-until such time as the Australian Wheat Board sells all its wheat this year, because the compensation component is really the difference between that amount and the price the Wheat Board would have got had the Gulf conflict not gone ahead.

         —At the time of the Budget I predicted that the financial community in Australia would react properly to this new deeming initiative, and that is what has happened. In fact, it has gotten better and better, even over recent weeks. If I were making a statement as to the number of accounts available at call, three weeks ago I would have said 29; two weeks ago I would have said 33; and a week ago I would have said 39. There are now 44 accounts available at call, and the numbers are going up all the time. Thirty-three of those 44 accounts are special accounts that have been made available for pensioners.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Obviously there is some variation in the conditions which apply to those accounts and that will always be the case in a competitive environment. However, there are now 26 accounts that pay 10 per cent from the first dollar-on the whole balance-and that includes three of the four major banks, that is, the Commonwealth Bank, the National Australia Bank Ltd and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. No doubt they are all doing well as a result of it. The State Bank of New South Wales and a host of the other larger banks have that now as well. A number of banks like the Advance Bank Australia Ltd and the ANZ Bank have actually improved their accounts in the past few weeks by announcing some changes. On that basis I think it is now able to be said quite categorically that the financial industry in Australia has reacted positively and the criterion I set down in the first place of 10 per cent available at call across the country is now well and truly met. That does not mean that I will not continue to monitor the situation carefully. I shall certainly do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is now an extensive radio and newspaper information campaign under way to explain the new rules, and Social Security hot lines are also well and truly in use. I have written to all age pensioners to inform the ones who are likely to be affected by deeming and of course we now have the situation where we believe most of them have complied already. One of the most successful measures, however, has been the Financial Information Service for Pensioners. In the last Budget we announced there would be 32 more officers in that service. Over the four-week period ended 1 March, FISP delivered help to over 17,000 pensioners and beneficiaries, which is an extraordinary record, a magnificent achievement, and one for which we should commend the 61 FISP officers around the country. Given that, the level of confusion and fear is gradually dying down. I am very confident that within a few months this will be an accepted reform where every person affected by it benefits financially.

Even in the newspapers one is confronted with the situation where the management, in a sense, is responding to that initiative. So, yes, I share the view which Senator Lewis has put about this sort of initiative. I have been aware of it for some time and I have already passed my congratulations to the unions.

The report produced recently by the EPM Consulting Group on the projected supply of professional engineers in Australia confirms the projection of other bodies that this country is facing a shortage of 30,000 engineers by the year 2010. It further states that to fill this gap will require an increase in graduations of 60 per cent plus an immigration level 25 per cent above the average of the 1980s, or a graduation increase alone of 220 per cent. Has the Government considered the engineer shortage in Australia? What steps does it propose? When will a start be made, particularly having in mind the continual worsening of the position and the increasing of the opportunities?

         —This has been a very long running issue in Australia. There are always figures quoted about the employment of engineers compared with employment levels of engineers in other countries. I must say that the employment of engineers in Australia has been very much a cyclical thing, with upturns and downturns in the mining industry, for example. Indeed, it is reasonable to say that a decade or so ago it was the policy of some of the peak engineering bodies not to encourage increased numbers of engineering students because of those cyclical effects, which were very detrimental to the profession. That has certainly been said to me by people associated with peak engineering bodies.

        As far as the particular report the honourable senator mentioned is concerned, I am not familiar with that but it is consistent with other reports, and I do not in any sense query those findings. In terms of migration, I think it is true to say for both scientists and engineers that there has been a significant net increase in those professions in Australia from migration in the last few years. That is a good thing. In terms of student numbers, what the report says is probably correct-that there is a very pressing need to increase student numbers in the engineering profession. Sometimes that does not happen, however, because of the lack of applicants for those courses, largely, I suspect, because of a reluctance to teach what are sometimes called the `hard disciplines' in secondary education in the 1970s. That undoubtedly has been a problem. In respect of the general issue of engineering and engineering research in Australia, I understand that the Government will be making an announcement about that in the next few weeks.

I ask the Minister, firstly, whether the evidence is consistent with Dr Mann's opinion. Secondly, if not, is the Minister able to reassure Australian women-most especially women aged 40 to 49, who appear to be most confused about the possible benefits of mammography-to allay any concerns they may have following Dr Mann's comments, and indeed those of Germaine Greer, as reported in the Sun-Herald a week earlier?

         —The answer to the first part of Senator Giles's very important question for Australian women is, quite simply, no. Advice to the Government, as contained in the Australian Institute of Health's report Breast Cancer Screening in Australia: Future Directions was unequivocal in its finding that mammography screening for breast cancer leads to a significant reduction in mortality.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On the basis of the report's recommendations, in March 1990 the Government announced its intention to establish the national program for the early detection of breast cancer. The main features of the program, which is being phased in over the next five years and which will deliver a coordinated, quality service for Australian women, are that a doctor's referral will not be required; the service will be at minimal or no cost to those taking part; and all clinics and assessment centres under the program will be accredited to ensure a high quality service in both the taking and reading of the X-ray film.
       </para>
       <para>
        Present indications are that with a fully operational screening program, 375 deaths could be averted if screening is of high quality, there is a high take-up rate and there is proper follow-up treatment of any abnormalities found. The reduction in mortality in women offered screening after five years is estimated to be in the order of 34 per cent. Women who regularly participate in screening can anticipate a reduction in their risk of death from breast cancer of around 58 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to the second part of Senator Giles's question, I acknowledge that there is some concern among women as to whether they should participate in mammography screening. It seems to be most evident among women aged 40-49 years, who seem to be subject to much conflicting advice, as instanced by Arnold Mann's recent comments. The Minister is of the view that there is considerable evidence that the incidence of breast cancer rises rapidly between the ages of 40 and 49 years, from 23.7 cases per 10,000 in the 30-34 years age range through to 138 cases per 10,000 in women aged 45-49 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Screening for early breast cancers by mammography is generally agreed to be more effective in post-menopausal women but, nonetheless, is one of the most effective means of cancer detection for all women, regardless of age. The decision, then, to include women aged 40-49 years in the national program was made on the basis that to exclude these women from the program would prevent a large number of women from having access to a service which could be of great benefit to them. The age range will, of course, be monitored and reviewed regularly. Finally, women under 40 years, who either have a family history of breast disease or suspected early symptoms of malignancy, will continue to have access to diagnostic mammography services, including the accompanying Medicare rebate.

         —Well, it was a schoolboy question in that respect. The truth of the matter is that, contrary to earlier reports, on which clearly those cartoons referred to in Senator Panizza's question were based, that the arrangements for the mission were running into some degree of difficulty and there were dangers of coming away with very limited access indeed, Dr Blewett and his delegation have been received very warmly at the highest levels by both the Kuwaiti and Saudi governments. Dr Blewett called on the Emir of Kuwait in Taif in Saudi Arabia yesterday, 11 March. I guess a number of honourable senators would have heard Dr Blewett's own account of that meeting in a radio interview this morning on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, including his report of the Emir's very positive reaction to Australia's early contribution following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and his affirmation that Australia should participate-in fact, he said it was imperative that we do so-in the reconstruction of Kuwait.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Again, today Dr Blewett and his delegation are following up this call by a visit to Kuwait itself where he will meet the Crown Prince, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and possibly some other Ministers as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as Saudi Arabia itself is concerned, despite the very short notice for this visit to be arranged and the enormous pressures on the Saudi Government at the moment with about 40 ministerial level delegations going through the country in the last few days or the next few days, it is the case that the Saudi Government has been extremely helpful in facilitating the arrangements for Dr Blewett's mission, including by providing an aircraft for the visit to Kuwait. The visit has full official status. Dr Blewett will be staying at the official government guest house just vacated by Mr James Baker and his party, I understand. Dr Blewett's program in Riyadh will include a meeting tomorrow, 13 March, with the Saudi Minister of Commerce, Mr al-Salim. Calls on a number of other Ministers have been proposed and are presently in the process, we hope, of being organised. Dr Blewett and the delegation will also meet Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council officials as well as senior Saudi businessmen.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the case, despite the scepticism of the questioner, that Dr Blewett's reception by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia demonstrates the very warm appreciation that those governments have of Australia's role in the Gulf crisis. The opening is there for Australia to participate in the rebuilding of Kuwait. Of course, we do have to take advantage of that opening by actively promoting those goods, services and expertise by the businessmen, the entrepreneurs, themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government stands ready to offer every facilitation on a continuing basis to that process through, in particular, our mission in Riyadh, which has both a diplomatic and a trade component. We are presently giving consideration to establishing further diplomatic representation in the area-perhaps in Kuwait itself, perhaps in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, depending on how things work out.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also actively liaising with Austrade in terms of mobilising the necessary resources to take advantage of the situation that presently presents itself and we do have a very senior officer of my Department, Mr Paul Barratt, acting as special ambassador and coordinator of the Australian business and governmental effort to take advantage of that situation. So the sort of churlishness that we have heard both in the press and in this place about the Government's and the business community's efforts in this respect are entirely misplaced.

         —I am aware of the allegations that have been made. The suggestions are, of course, ludicrous and those who are making them are reducing this whole process to that of a joke-a joke on themselves, I might add. This Government introduced the affirmative action legislation five years ago. We have therefore had a chance to see it in operation. It was, at the time it was introduced, and it continues to be, legislation that is based on merit as a basis for employment and promotion at all times. Indeed, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in his second reading speech, when introducing the legislation on 19 February 1986 said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government is determined that women should be able to enter and compete in the labour market on an equal footing with men and that outdated prejudices or conventions should not prevent them from fully participating.

       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to stress that the Government's affirmative action legislation does not propose positive discrimination or reverse discrimination. We are totally opposed to the use of quotas, and this legislation, by stating that all actions are to be based on merit, makes this clear.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Bill 1986 was introduced by the Government as a practical measure to remove barriers in discrimination against women in the work force. Those barriers do exist. Some of them include the long-held stereotype of what is women's work and what is men's work in the workplace and the lack of access to training and career paths for women. Only 11 per cent of all apprentices in Australia are women. If we take out hairdressing apprentices, only 3.8 per cent of all apprentices in Australia are women.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another barrier is that women often, and almost exclusively, take responsibility for child-care in the family home and, thus, interrupt their careers accordingly. In addition, they frequently have two jobs-that in the work force and that of providing care and child-care at home as the so-called housewife.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also quite convincing documentary evidence to show that there is unequal access by women workers to over-award payments and indeed to overtime in the Australian workplace. Anyone who would argue that the legislation operates as reverse discrimination should have his attention directed to the remarks of, among other people, Mrs Carolyn Hewson, who is reported in the Australian today--

Given the fact that 17 of all those contracted may have had financial difficulties or gone bankrupt, if one were to accept the premise of Senator Newman's question, then I think we need to take that figure into account in terms of the relative budget in this area.

I would expect, as has happened in every other circumstance, that the press statement is ready and is out in the boxes already.

         —Senator Watson is getting the answer. The question was: what sorts of financial management practices have been put in place in Administrative Services to take into account these sorts of problems? Let me say: we have restructured the Department. It is on a commercial footing. It has been acknowledged by a wide number of commentators both within and outside government as operating quite successfully on that footing. The last one I quoted was Mr Henry Bosch, who talked of changes in Administrative Services as somewhat of a perestroika approach in governments in this country-fundamental changes that have placed imperatives on managers in government to provide services on a cost effective basis.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Our process has not stopped there. We are committed to continuing that process of reform within Administrative Services. If those opposite do not mind waiting a few more hours, they will probably get some more information in respect of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I go back specifically within the parameters of a commercialisation approach in Administrative Services, let me say that there are quite extensive scrutinies which take place in terms of contracting out to organisations, either in the construction area or other areas of this Government. Whether tenderers are approaching Government to go into construction or to go on contracts for the provision of all sorts of services, there are quite extensive assessments. But Senator Newman should know that one cannot have capitalisation without bankruptcy, and that is an endemic part of the system.

         —On 5 March 1991, Senator Crichton-Browne asked me a question as Minister representing the Treasurer concerning the 1990-91, $8.1 billion Budget surplus estimated at Budget time last August, and how much of that was earmarked for payment of the government debt. I have obtained an answer from the Treasurer. It is somewhat lengthy. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.

       </para>
       <para>
        The 1990-91 budget statements indicated that of the prospective $8.1 billion surplus, around $7.1 billion would be available for debt redemption. It was envisaged that this would include scheduled Treasury Bond maturities of around $3 1/2 billion, redemptions of $1/2 billion of Australian Savings Bonds and around $1 1/4 billion foreign currency debt to be retired on maturity and through early calls and the exercising of sinking fund options. It was noted that there would be scope to repay additional domestic and foreign currency liabilities prior to maturity. The stock of Treasury Notes on issue was expected to remain at around the same level at year-end as at the beginning of the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of early calls, sinking fund options and repurchases of foreign debt have already been undertaken so that a total of about $2 billion in foreign currency debt will have been retired over the financial year. Redemptions of Australian Savings Bonds are now expected to be a little lower than was envisaged at Budget time. With the reduction in the expected budget surplus, the Government has announced that a program of Treasury Bond tenders will be conducted this year to meet maturing securities. In addition, it is now envisaged that we will exit 1990-91 with a larger stock of Treasury Notes on issue than at the beginning of the financial year.

       <para>
        The growing demand for provision of higher education in North Queensland has been an important factor in allocating 1,600 new places to James Cook University between 1988 and 1993. This has been supported with capital grants of $19m. The Commonwealth does not however earmark places or operating grants for individual campuses. James Cook University has established a campus in co-operation with TAFE in Cairns and is currently providing courses in Arts, Social Work, Psychology and Community Welfare.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been pressure to invest in development of regional campuses in many regional centres throughout Australia in recent years. Before committing funds for capital development in regional centres, it has been Commonwealth policy to ensure that there is sufficient demand for higher education provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all cases where there has been pressure to invest in development of regional campuses, we have requested that demand be tested by offering a limited range of courses using TAFE facilities prior to Commonwealth commitment to large scale capital investment. A recent newspaper report from North Queensland indicated that James Cook University was able to offer places at Cairns to all qualified applicants for 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth also considers the educational viability of any projected development of new campuses. In order to be viable, a campus must be able to offer enough courses to enable students to complete their course of study. This means there must be a large enough student population to support the staffing levels required over the long term. It is important therefore to establish that the demand is growing.
       </para>
       <para>
        As establishment of a new campus has very long term implications, the Commonwealth also requires commitment from States Governments before allocating funds for capital development. A Working Party involving the Commonwealth, the State and James Cook University has been established to oversee longer term planning for higher education provision in Cairns.

        AUSTUDY PAYMENTS FOR CONTINUING STUDENTS IN 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTUDY recipients are paid on a fortnightly basis. The last pay day in 1990 was Wednesday 26 December (actually prepaid on Friday 21 December). The first pay day in 1991 was Wednesday 9 January-exactly two weeks later.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words the system is designed to ensure that there is no break in continuity of payment for continuing students who lodge correct application forms in sufficient time for their forms to be processed prior to the first pay day in 1991. Obviously, if insufficient information is provided on application forms, payment cannot be approved.
       </para>
       <para>
        DEET has established a national client service standard whereby 80% of applicants are to receive notification of approval/rejection of their application within 21 days. This standard is being met comfortably. Of those approved for pay the majority receive their payment within this 21 day time-frame.
       </para>
       <para>
        The adoption of best management practices, together with innovations such as a major redesign and simplification of the notice of assessment and application forms specially designed for continuing students, have helped ensure that Student Assistance Centres can continue to improve the level of service provided to clients. These improvements have led to impressive achievements. In comparison with the first pay day in 1990, double the number of applicants received payment on the first pay day of 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        Urgent payments may be granted to students who are in financial difficulty, either as a result of their personal circumstances or because of delays in processing their application. Cases are processed urgently or counter cheques are made available in cases involving hardship.
       </para>
       <para>
        Continuing students are catered for through the above arrangements and have no entitlement to Department of Social Security (DSS) benefits, nor should they.
       </para>
       <para>
        For new students, transferral arrangements exist whereby a DSS benefit can be paid up until the day before the intending student commences full-time study. AUSTUDY is then granted from the following day and urgent payments may be made in cases involving hardship.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even though the telephone number of a senior DEET official has appeared in a Melbourne metropolitan newspaper only two inquiries regarding hardship surfaced. I repeat my request last week for written advice of hardship cases being raised by Senator Bell.

It is not. My objection to affirmative action is, as I said, that it is a policy which makes women second-class citizens in that it leaves them open to the allegation that they achieved their position only because there is a requirement for so many women. I stand by that statement.

        Mr President, early this year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) determined that he should deliver a major statement about what we must do together to meet the economic challenges facing this country. Today we want to speak with our fellow Australians not in the jargon of economists but in terms we can all understand. We do this because, while we will be announcing decisions of fundamental economic importance for the future of this country--

Then the Minister, presumably, would want the opportunity to present his own supporting statement. We indicated, as a matter of courtesy, that we then saw no reason that the Treasurer's additional statement need be read in this place.

May I go on and say to Senator Button that I respect him calling in a runner and having someone else read the speech. I can well understand that it is a very onerous task; and I do not have any objection to that. But what we are objecting to is that Senator Evans was babbling in a way which we cannot understand. Mr President, this is said to be one of the most important speeches that the Prime Minister has made. We, in the Senate, are all waiting to hear what the words of the Prime Minister are. We do not want it babbled at us in a way which makes it unintelligible to the ear. That is the point that we are raising.

         —Thank you, Mr President. Government has the responsibility to lead the community by getting the right policy framework-we will do that. But it is only with the understanding, the commitment, of all Australians-as individuals, and through their representative organisations-that our nation will best meet the challenges ahead.
        </para>

       <para>
        What are those challenges?
       </para>
       <para>
        The first is for us all to realise that this tough, increasingly competitive world of five and a half billion people does not owe, and will not give, seventeen million Australians an easy prosperity. The days of our being able to hitch a free ride in a world clamouring, and prepared to pay high prices, for our rural and mineral products, are behind us.
       </para>
       <para>
        From this fact flows everything else.
       </para>
       <para>
        The challenge for the foreseeable future, is to produce more than we spend. The rest of the world will not allow us to continue indefinitely to live beyond our means by borrowing from them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our rural and mineral products will remain important into the future. But the challenge is to add to them. That is, we must export more manufactured goods and services and substitute more quality Australian production for imports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The challenge is therefore to make the decisions and adopt the practices and attitudes which will enable this and succeeding generations to achieve those basic goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are the challenges. How we are prepared together to meet them will determine the standards we can enjoy and the kind of Australia we will pass on to our children.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will today announce a package of substantial new measures directed to the fundamental task facing this nation: improving the productive capacity of an economy that will be more internationally competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Highlights of the package are: tariff cuts, reduced wholesale sales taxes for business, substantial business savings through simpler depreciation, retraining assistance, new support for apprentices and further initiatives in education and research to build the `clever country'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer and Senator Button will today be making more detailed statements covering the announcements in their respective portfolio areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these measures continue and intensify the far-reaching reforms the Government has initiated over the past eight years. Ultimately, they sharpen our ability to reduce the current account deficit and stabilise foreign debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        We emphasise that they share one overriding objective: building a competitive Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this statement we will reaffirm for the Australian people the longer-term economic goals to which we aspire, and identify the progress we are making towards them.
       </para>
       <para>
        And we want all our fellow Australians to understand where the nation is moving and to understand how all of us-workers, employers and Government-have complementary roles to play in achieving our common goals. I say it again: in the final analysis the challenges ahead demand the involvement of all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian economy is currently at or near the bottom of a downturn that has been sharper, deeper and more prolonged than we anticipated.
       </para>
       <para>
        We acknowledge the recession has hurt many people and cost many jobs, and that is something we regret very deeply.
       </para>
       <para>
        Higher unemployment is likely in coming months. Rural Australia in particular is experiencing a very tough period.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are some important global factors at work. But we don't walk away from the Government's ultimate responsibility to manage the national economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        And we certainly do not resile from having taken the necessary decision to squeeze demand by high interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Policy makers and commentators, in Australia and around the world, underestimated the strength of resurgent demand in the wake of the 1987 sharemarket crash.
       </para>
       <para>
        But with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that had we acted sooner to dampen that surge, some of the current hardship could have been avoided.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question facing us now is not: will we emerge from the recession?
       </para>
       <para>
        For the decisions necessary to end the recession have already been taken: official interest rates have been brought down by 6 percentage points over the last fourteen months; and tax cuts paid on 1 January will also stimulate demand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Business will begin to rebuild stocks, and international confidence will be helped by the successful end of the Gulf War.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are testing months immediately ahead. But the best estimate is that we will be coming out of the recession in the second half of this year. So the real question, and the real challenge, facing us is: how can we ensure that when we emerge from the recession, we will be best equipped to take up the opportunities for sustained growth?
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular we have the opportunity to secure economic recovery:
       </para>
       <para>
        - with low inflation
       </para>
       <para>
        - and hence lower interest rates
       </para>
       <para>
        - in an increasingly competitive and productive economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        And this Government is determined to seize that opportunity.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what this Statement is really about today. It is not about short term palliatives, but longer term structural change to make us a more competitive nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was what the Government set out, eight years ago, to achieve-through fundamental reform of long established economic institutions and of deeply entrenched attitudes.
       </para>
       <para>
        We still have a long way to go but today we can certainly say that, together, we have made substantial progress: we are more open to the world and we are more efficient at home.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are becoming more competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        1. Tariffs and Australia's trading future
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the most powerful spur to greater competitiveness is further tariff reduction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tariffs have been one of the abiding features of the Australian economy since Federation. Tariffs protected Australian industry by making foreign goods more expensive here; and the supposed virtues of this protection became deeply embedded in the psyche of the nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        But what in fact was the result?
       </para>
       <para>
        - inefficient industries that could not compete overseas; and
       </para>
       <para>
        - higher prices for consumers and higher costs for our efficient primary producers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Worse still, tariffs are a regressive burden-that is, the poorest Australians are hurt more than the richest. The Industry Commission estimates that the burden tariffs impose on lowest income Australians is three times heavier than that imposed on those with the highest incomes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Right from the start, this Government deliberately and determinedly set about pulling down the tariff walls. By 1992 our existing programs will have slashed the nominal rate of assistance to the manufacturing sector by over one-third, from 13 to 8 per cent, and the effective rate from 22 to 12 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The results, the benefits, have been dramatic.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 1985, manufacturing output, employment and exports have all expanded at rates faster than the OECD average.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the Australian consumer and business, prices for many goods are lower than they would otherwise have been.

       <para>
        Tariff cuts presented Australian manufacturers with a major challenge. To their credit, many of them are meeting that challenge. Their endeavours are too rarely appreciated and their success all too often underestimated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this Government will continue to open up the manufacturing sector and Australian industry generally through lower protection. We now announce:
       </para>
       <para>
        * the general level of assistance will be reduced from 10% and 15% in 1992 to a general rate of 5% by 1996;
       </para>
       <para>
        * tariffs on passenger motor vehicles will be phased down from 35% in 1992 in annual steps of 2.5 per cent to 15% in 2000;
       </para>
       <para>
        This change can be expected to result in an average real reduction of $2,000 to $3,000 in the price of a $20,000 car, in today's dollars, over the next decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also announce:
       </para>
       <para>
        * tariff reductions on textile, clothing and footwear will be accelerated so that the maximum tariff will be 25% by the year 2000 and the termination of quotas will be brought forward two years to 1 March 1993; and
       </para>
       <para>
        * general agricultural assistance will be reduced in line with the pace of tariff reform in manufacturing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dimension of what we have achieved is demonstrated by the fact that these changes will bring the average nominal rate of assistance down to 3 per cent, and the average effective rate down to 5 per cent, by the end of the decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these changes will help keep inflation, and therefore interest rates, down.
       </para>
       <para>
        They will also make our exporters and our import competing sector more competitive by lowering the cost of their inputs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overall impact of the reforms will be a net gain in employment, although jobs will be lost in declining industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been the Government's firm conviction that if the community believes that change is necessary in the interests of the community as a whole, then that belief carries with it a necessary corollary-that the community must not leave those individuals or groups who are adversely affected to bear the whole burden of change. It must itself be prepared to share that burden of change, as well as reaping the benefits of change.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, we will establish labour adjustment programs to assist displaced workers in our car and textiles, clothing and footwear industries with relocation, training, and wages subsidies for redeployment to other jobs. This will cost at least $90 million over the life of the programs. Mr President, with these tariff cuts, we demonstrate once again our commitment to liberalising international trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has been fortified in this approach by a number of recent reports, not least Dr. Ross Garnaut's report Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendency.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have rejected the views of the so-called ``new protectionists'' because they are simply proposing, in effect, the same discredited policies that had isolated our national economy from the rest of the world and caused the great damage we are all working to repair.
       </para>
       <para>
        However much our competitors might bend or break the principles of fair trade, our own self-interest is served by a steadfast refusal to return to the days of protectionism.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we don't for a minute seek to excuse those nations who do flout the rules of international trade, especially those who cause so much damage to our farm trade. The problem lies in the inadequacy of the rules on agriculture under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT has been an outstanding success in substantially reducing manufacturing protection around the world. As a result, world trade in manufactures has boomed.
       </para>
       <para>
        But at the same time, agricultural trade has been absolutely corrupted-particularly by the European Community and to a lesser extent by the United States and Japan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently, their combined farm subsidies have averaged more than $300 billion-a year! And this for a sector which produces only about 3 per cent of their GDP.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has imposed a heavy burden on our farmers: despite consistent large productivity gains, they exported the same volume of goods in 1989-90 as they did ten years earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        While world trade thrived, agriculture, one of our most competitive and significant sectors, has marked time.
       </para>
       <para>
        So what further steps can we take to improve our trading position?
       </para>
       <para>
        First, we will maintain our vigorous international campaign to achieve equal treatment for agriculture under the GATT umbrella. The Europeans already accept, due in no small way to the efforts of the Cairns Group, led by Australia, that there can be no result in the Uruguay Round negotiations without substantial reform of agricultural trade. We will keep pushing them hard.
       </para>
       <para>
        Members of both sides of this Parliament have recently visited Washington, and will travel to Europe in coming months, to urge both sides to avoid the chaos and insanity of a trade war.
       </para>
       <para>
        This international campaign by Australia depends for its credibility and impact on one thing: on our general willingness to practise at home what we preach abroad.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will announce a rural adjustment package in April to ensure that those farmers most in need during the current rural crisis receive appropriate assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, we will help our farmers and manufacturers take effective action against foreign producers who seek to dump their products on the Australian market at unfair prices. We will strengthen anti-dumping procedures, including by cutting 40 days off the time taken to process complaints.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourth, the preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea will be phased out from 1 July 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fifth, we will provide $2 million to continue the Australian Made Campaign, since reducing our reliance on imports is totally complementary, in economic terms, to expanding our performance in exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sixth, we will upgrade the services available to Australian exporters. In particular:
       </para>
       <para>
        * We will boost the capital base and range of services provided by the Export Finance Insurance Corporation by making available a $200 million callable capital base to supplement EFIC's existing reserves.
       </para>
       <para>
        * A new $50 million facility will be made available by EFIC, to enable Australian exporters to meet demands for performance bonds without using their own reserves.
       </para>
       <para>
        * We will create a new program of fellowships so that Australian business men and women, and recent graduates, can get direct working experience in the Asia-Pacific region.
       </para>
       <para>
        * We will implement the McKinsey report recommendations including refocusing Austrade's efforts on the Asia-Pacific region.
       </para>
       <para>
        * We will transfer responsibility for Austrade to the Minister for Overseas Trade and Development from 1 September-

        2. Greater Efficiency and Competition within Australia
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, with further tariff cuts, we are dismantling the barriers to competitiveness and efficiency that stand at the borders of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government is also set on dismantling the barriers that exist within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have pioneered the concept, and the delivery, of micro-economic reform-seen by industry, rightly, as an essential means towards higher productivity and efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are freeing up our transport systems; we have revolutionised our taxation system; we are creating more efficient workplaces; we are injecting competition where for too long Australian firms and public sector enterprises have been content with the quiet life.
       </para>
       <para>
        And we are reforming the processes of Government itself through the Special Premiers Conferences.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all this, perhaps no issue has achieved the prominence of the waterfront so essential to our export performance. It is particularly satisfying to be able to report to the Senate on the achievement, just last week, of a new agreement that will deliver breakthroughs in waterfront productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The agreement between the Waterside Workers' Federation and Conaust Ltd, following an earlier agreement with National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, now means waterfront employees and the two largest waterfront employers are committed to a total restructuring of their industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In describing the significance of this latest agreement, we can do no better than to quote the words of Mr Richard Setchell, the Chairman of Conaust, who said it was `a win for the economy and the international competitiveness of Australia'. By year's end, the national waterfront labour force will have been cut--

        Mr President, by year's end, the national waterfront labour force will have been cut by over 1,500-in anyone's language, a major gain in efficiency.

       <para>
        In all, the agreements provide for productivity gains of up to 60 per cent; in smaller ports and in grain handling, 70 per cent.

        What appeared an ambitious program when we commenced these reforms, is now proceeding on schedule, and without major industrial disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        In shipping, we are ahead of schedule in delivering smaller, more efficient crews on existing vessels and the introduction of new ships crewed at manning levels equal to or better than those of our major trading partners.
       </para>
       <para>
        In telecommunications, in aviation, in road and rail transport, in removing through national uniform regulations the requirement for business to meet six or seven different standards, we are achieving fundamental gains in efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        This activity amounts to the most ambitious plan, the most rapid pace, and the most comprehensive sweep of micro-economic reform this country has ever seen. Productivity is increasing, and new investment is taking place-all without industrial disruption.
       </para>
       <para>
        And here we are witness to a paradox. Those who for more than a generation in office entrenched the inadequacies of the past and themselves effected no change whatsoever, now with an hypocrisy that is truly breathtaking, clamour for even faster change.
       </para>
       <para>
        They bear an onus, which they simply cannot discharge, of showing how in a practical way this could be achieved without poisoning the better industrial relations and investment environment we have created-without, in short, bringing the whole reform process to a grinding halt.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a matter of our results versus their rhetoric.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will press ahead with further reform, to increase competition and efficiency within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the consumer, competition means lower prices and a broader range of better quality goods and services; for producers it provides the spur to better performance-at home and abroad.
       </para>
       <para>
        We want to see the whole domestic economy opened up to this kind of positive structural change.
       </para>
       <para>
        And we have established a sub-committee of Cabinet's Structural Adjustment Committee to examine systemically the whole economy for opportunities to promote this process.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Act is our principal legislative weapon to ensure consumers get the best deal from competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        But there are many areas of the Australian economy today that are immune from that Act: some Commonwealth enterprises, State public sector businesses, and significant areas of the private sector, including the professions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This patchwork coverage reflects historical and constitutional factors, not economic efficiencies; it is another important instance of the way we operate as six economies, rather than one.
       </para>
       <para>
        The benefits for the consumer of expanding the scope of the Trade Practices Act could be immense: potentially lower professional fees, cheaper road and rail fares, cheaper electricity.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has to be done-and the Prime Minister has initiated the process, by today writing to the Premiers urging a positive examination of all we can do, at the May Special Premiers Conference, to widen the ambit of the Trade Practices Act to bring such excluded areas within the scope of a national framework of competition policy and law.

        Investment for the 1990s
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, to secure sustainable economic growth and the living standards to which we aspire, we need to ensure that there is a fertile environment for investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our efforts to repair the macro-economic fundamentals underpinned rapid investment growth in the late 1980s-through the Accord, through floating the dollar, and through cutting Government spending.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is, however, one other fundamental which is crucial to investment: inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is vital that Australians understand the debilitating nature of the inflation disease.
       </para>
       <para>
        High inflation has brought high interest rates and a higher cost of capital than in our trading partners. This, in turn, undermined investment and made it harder for Australian firms to compete overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has also discouraged productive investment in areas that would generate jobs and exports in favour of speculation in real estate.
       </para>
       <para>
        But today we have the opportunity of putting Australia on a low inflation path.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's inflation is now below the OECD average: ours is 6.9 per cent and just 5.4 per cent in underlying terms and theirs is 7.2 per cent. A continued lowering of inflation--

        A continued lowering of inflation is, without doubt, the major contribution this Government can make to the climate for investment in the 1990s.

       <para>
        Of course new investment, combined with lower tariffs, has meant, and will mean for a time, higher imports and a higher current account deficit.

       <para>
        This becomes even more obvious at times when commodity prices are falling, as they are now, due to the slowdown in world economic growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        But this is a short term cost we must bear if we are to wind back the current account deficit in a sustainable way and thereby reduce our foreign indebtedness permanently. We are taking the essential steps to build an economy that is stronger in the long term. There are other important areas where we can take action to foster productive investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is very concerned at the difficulty which small and medium-sized Australian companies face in raising long term funds.

        We are pursuing discussions with major financial institutions aimed at overcoming this difficulty by ensuring a readier flow of such funds.

       <para>
        The development of new industry and the rejuvenation of the old depends on ready access to appropriately skilled labour-access which is increasingly difficult in our sprawling cities, with their often inefficient transport systems. These factors also reduce the quality of life for the residents affected. We are cooperating with Commonwealth, State and local government to develop effective approaches to these issues.

        Mr President, this Government has done more than any other to reform the taxation system so that, as far as possible, tax considerations do not distort investment decisions.

       </para>
       <para>
        * a substantial widening of exemptions from sales tax for business inputs used by manufacturers, primary producers and miners. The cost to revenue of this measure will amount in 1992-93 to $375 million. But the cost benefits to producers, allowing for the effects of mark-ups as goods pass along the production chain, will in that year total around $700 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        * we have radically overhauled depreciation provisions to bring them more in line with business realities. The reforms provide, for the first time, a definition in the Act of effective life. And it will allow self-assessment by the taxpayer. This will result in savings to business of the order of $100 million in 1992-93.

        An industry which will benefit from these new tax provisions is tourism, which has generated over 100,000 new jobs during the 1980s and has the potential for substantial further expansion.
       </para>
       <para>
        One sector of the Australian economy is unique in terms of the investment environment in which it operates-the forest industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government's consistent commitment is to the proper protection of our precious native forests. This has been, and remains, fundamental to our approach to Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we recognise that-in part due to this commitment-there has been a contraction of the forest resource allocated to existing operations in the industry. Concern about future access to the resource has made new investment uncertain.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Government has decided to provide resource security for major new wood processing projects
       </para>
       <para>
        * where the project involves a capital- intensive value-adding investment of $100 million or more and is directed to export or to import replacement;
       </para>
       <para>
        * where the proponent of the project makes a commitment to adhere to environment, heritage and Aboriginal policy requirements; and
       </para>
       <para>
        * where the State Government agrees to enact parallel resource security legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Resource security will involve undertakings backed by legislation, guaranteeing an agreed volume of timber supply from an identified catchment area. There will also be provision in the legislation to establish plantations to provide for long-term timber supply. The objective is to phase out woodchip exports by the year 2000 or soon after, and to replace them with value-added products. This new emphasis on plantations which will also, over time, take pressure off our native forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the Government decided on resource security legislation only after receiving unqualified legal advice that it was the sole way the Commonwealth could provide a binding undertaking of the kind necessary to get major projects started which will provide new exports and new jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government has a duty to listen to and understand all legitimate community interests. It has a responsibility then to seek as far as possible to balance those interests where they compete. It should, where appropriate, establish processes aimed to achieve that purpose. In the end, Government must do what it was elected to do and make the necessary decisions. This will mean facing up to tough issues and it will rarely entail universal approbation.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is in this case where the Government has struck the correct balance between environmental concerns-to which our commitment remains vital and unambiguous-and the interests of one of Australia's largest industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Becoming a Clever Country
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I said at the outset that securing the future of the country is in the hands of each one of us. To achieve change, we must mobilise our most valuable resource: the talents of the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        This does not necessarily mean working harder; in Germany and Japan, both highly successful competitive countries, working hours are actually falling.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it does mean working smarter-working more effectively, using new materials, new production technologies and new management methods. It means being, like Germany and Japan, a clever country.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the last election campaign the Prime Minister said that Australia needed to become a clever country. The centrepiece of his commitment to that goal was the creation of a network of Cooperative Research Centres. He said that these Centres would draw together outstanding research groups to provide new drive to our national research effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today we announce that the Government has selected the first fifteen Cooperative Research Centres. These Centres will focus their research effort on projects in the following key areas:
       </para>
       <para>
        * resource based industries;
       </para>
       <para>
        * manufacturing and information industries;
       </para>
       <para>
        * the environment; and
       </para>
       <para>
        * medical research.
       </para>
       <para>
        My colleague the Minister for Science and Technology will provide details of successful projects this week.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also decided to continue indefinitely the tax deduction for spending on research and development at 125%.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cooperation with our talented neighbours in the region is important if we are to remain at the frontiers of technology. The Multifunction Polis provides an opportunity to do this. Next month the Government will receive the report of the MFP Adelaide Management Group which was set up to assess the economic and social viability of the MFP.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cleverness is not confined to our universities and `hi-tech' firms. Cleverness is something that should permeate the entire society-and especially our workplaces. And the foundation of a clever country is its eduction system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has repeatedly stated its pride in our achievements in virtually doubling the school retention rate, in expanding the number of tertiary places.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite simply, unless we give our young people the motivation and the opportunity to bring out the best in themselves through education, we shall never be able to bring out the best in ourselves as a nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today we announce
       </para>
       <para>
        * an increase in the number and average value of Australian Postgraduate Research Awards;
       </para>
       <para>
        * extra funding of $15 million over three years for the Country Areas Program to focus on greater rural school retention; and
       </para>
       <para>
        * $10 million over three years in a community project to identify the key elements of good schooling.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ours is a dynamic region, in a world of ceaseless technological innovation and burgeoning knowledge-based industries. In a clever country, all of us, as workers and managers, need to upgrade our job skills regularly.
       </para>
       <para>
        A recession can savagely damage the job skills of a nation. Apprentices have been hit particularly hard in the past-young Australians seeking to acquire and improve their job skills have been laid off with their training incomplete.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, we announce a new program of assistance so that employers can retain and improve the skills of apprentices and other workers who would otherwise be working reduced hours or have been retrenched.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will also spend $74 million over two years to provide work experience opportunities for people unemployed for more than six months.
       </para>
       <para>
        And we will commit $50 million over the next fifteen months to provide additional pre-vocational training places, and we will seek State cooperation in this.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will provide $6 million over three years to strengthen management skills.
       </para>
       <para>
        Education is clearly a vital preparation for the work force in a clever country, but it is in the workplace itself that the skills must be developed if they are to yield the productivity dividend we so desperately need in our enterprises.

         — Encore? Encore? Those opposite have asked for an encore, Mr President. I repeat: our trade union movement has made an enormous contribution to the creation of a more efficient Australia. Union amalgamations involving workers in metals, the public service, health, textiles, timber products and telecommunications have already been concluded. There are some fifty other amalgamations currently under way. The Government will commit a further $1.45 million to assist this process in 1991-92.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We also pay tribute to those employers who, in partnership with the trade unions, have secured major gains through award restructuring and workplace reform.

        The Pappas Carter Report commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Council, and recent publications by EPAC, have placed particular emphasis on the importance of changing the workplace culture. In cooperation with the AMC, we will develop a program to raise the efficiency of Australian enterprises to world standards. We will draw on the experience of our own world class companies together with the best practice that can be found anywhere in the world in this endeavour. The Government is particularly pleased to announce that John Prescott, managing director of BHP and chairman of the AMC, has agreed to chair the board that will oversee the new program.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have earmarked $25 million over two years for the program.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the measures we have announced today are absolutely vital for the continued transformation of the Australian economy. At the same time, they compromise neither our demonstrated commitment to fiscal restraint nor our medium term objective to maintain the structural integrity of the Budget. Their total costs in outlays and foregone revenue are $33 million in 1990-91, $446 million in 1991-92 and $854 million in 1992-93.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this Government has never been in doubt about the kind of Australia we wish to build-a modern, growing, prosperous and competitive economy, within a tolerant and fair society; a nation where quality of life counts for as much as quantity of output; an outward-looking community, enmeshed with the dynamism of the Asia Pacific region, and capable of taking on the best the world has to offer-and winning.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are not short-term goals; they are not transitory values.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are deeply embedded in the character of this Government and this Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        This process of modernisation, of adaptation to the changing world economy, is not something that has some future cut-off point. It must be a continuing process.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no point at which we can say, reform is finished-because there is no point at which the world will stop changing.
       </para>
       <para>
        And this is the essential point, Mr President. We live in a world of unprecedented, indeed breathtaking, change. Our own region is a crucible for change.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can no longer afford the easy simplicities, the costly complacencies of the fifties and sixties and seventies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say ``costly'' because we are now paying the price for the neglect of those decades.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our task now is to make sure that future generations are not called upon to pay a similar price for any neglect or complacency on our part, in this make-or-break decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need the habit of adaptation-because the lesson of international competitiveness must be constantly learned and re-learned.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we get the basics right in these critical years we need not set limits on our prospects. The Government does not avoid the fact that we hold these prospects out to you at a time of recession. But we should understand that Australia comes to this task with two great advantages-enduring advantages that transcend the temporary, but real, difficulties of the recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, we bring to the task our great natural and acquired endowments as a nation-our vast material resources, our vibrant multicultural community, our strengths as a free and prosperous people, our proximity to the fastest growing regional economy in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, in meeting these tremendous challenges that lie ahead, we are not, in 1991, starting out from scratch. We are not, in this decade, coming to the task cold.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have already taken many of the essential decisions, we have already learned many of the vital lessons, we are already enmeshing ourselves with our region, we have already mastered many of the skills that we will need, to enter the next century with well-founded confidence that we will reach our goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we must face the fact unflinchingly that we need as a nation to equip ourselves, further, to meet the challenges of exposure to international competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has been central to the endeavour of this Government. It is central to the theme of this statement. It is the central purpose of the measures that we have announced today. It must remain the central challenge of this great nation for decades to come.
       </para>
       <para>
        The involvement, the commitment of all Australians is the vital ingredient to success in the challenge ahead. It is a challenge that, together, we can face and meet with confidence.

       It is about making Australia more efficient and making it work better.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are two very clear economic challenges facing the Government:
      </para>
      <para>
       * the recession and the problems which it is causing for many Australians; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * the continuing restructuring of the Australian economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The recession has resulted in anxiety and reduced levels of confidence within industry and the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       But it does not reduce the importance of continued structural change in the Australian economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Without continuing change and fundamental restructuring of industry and the economy, the next generation would inherit a much poorer Australia. We must improve our capacity to pay for all the products we buy from overseas.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1988 the Government introduced a general program to phase down most tariffs to 10 or 15 per cent by 1992. Prior to 1988 tariffs had already been lowered on an industry-by-industry basis. These tariff reductions were accompanied by other measures to enhance the performance of Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       These steps were essential to develop an outward looking and internationally competitive industry in Australia. Only by doing this could it be possible for Australia to take advantage of the rapid growth occurring in our region.
      </para>
      <para>
       The task facing Australia in 1983 was daunting. As Professor Helen Hughes noted in her report on Australian exports, and I quote:
      </para>
      <para>
       The difficulties of reversing the protectionist policies which have existed in some States for more than a hundred years and overcoming the structural and productive inefficiencies which they have created, cannot be achieved overnight.

        —Mr President, I repeat: this Government inherited a legacy of inaction from the previous conservative Government. I invite senators to listen, if to nothing else, to the next two sentences. For example, the average nominal and effective rates of assistance accorded Australian industry were not reduced over the period 1975 to 1983. As a result the huge costs of inefficiencies in our ports and transport systems were masked by high levels of protection, complacency and inertia.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Since 1983 we have had an unchanging commitment to the concept of a growing and internationally competitive industry. Our strategies have been aimed at building a more productive culture within industry and the community generally, revitalising our mature industries and fostering the growth of new industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       Despite the low base from which we started much has been achieved in a relatively short time.
      </para>
      <para>
       The decline in manufacturing's share of GDP, in train since the 1960s, has been arrested. Manufacturing investment has grown at unprecedented rates over the period. In terms of the growth in manufacturing employment, production and exports, Australia has outperformed most other countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The record of manufacturing since 1983 shows that Australian industry can compete successfully against the rest of the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       This statement will continue to build the base for continued growth in the 1990s. It involves the Government setting the environment for an internationally oriented, forward looking industry able to compete vigorously with foreign companies and to share in the growing prosperity of this region.
      </para>
      <para>
       While Australian industry has grown stronger and more resilient over the last eight years, the rest of the world has not been standing still. Other countries have been assiduous in their pursuit of reforms, increasing their research and development, and generally improving their competitiveness. That is why we in Australia have to do more. We have to change faster.

       These points have been underscored in the recent reports of the Hughes Committee, Professor Garnaut and the Australian Manufacturing Council, each of which has been a vital input to this statement.
      </para>

       The decisions announced today will assist Australian firms in facing the challenges of the 1990s.

       REDUCING PROTECTION
      </para>
      <para>
       General Reductions
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, I turn to the question of reducing protection. In 1988 the Government introduced an across-the-board program to phase down all tariffs (except passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear) to either 10 per cent or 15 per cent by 1992.
      </para>
      <para>
       If Australian industry is to compete successfully in the 1990s it needs to take a longer term approach to its activities. Equally, the Government needs to provide a stable, long-term environment within which industry can plan and invest. As such industry is entitled to know well in advance the tariff regime to apply after 1992.
      </para>
      <para>
       Accordingly, general tariff rates will phase down over four years from 1992 to 1996 from 15 and 10 per cent to a single rate of 5 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       This decision will finally put behind us the legacy of a highly protected, inward looking industry sector. It will reinforce the fact that Australia's prosperity can only be achieved by creating the environment within which Australian industry can compete internationally.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most Australian firms have already responded to the challenges of reduced tariff assistance and are able to compete on equal terms with foreign competition. Indeed our forward looking companies dismiss tariff assistance as being irrelevant to their competitive strategies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Passenger Motor Vehicles
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn to the passenger motor industry. Prior to the current arrangements there had been a plethora of different assistance packages for the passenger motor vehicle industry. The current arrangements represent the first stable long term assistance package for the industry since the early 1960s.
      </para>
      <para>
       This stability has given the industry the certainty needed to invest to improve competitiveness and integrate with the world economy. It has been able to compete with imports at lower levels of Government assistance and provide better quality products for consumers at lower real prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the plan which has the real tariff rate phasing from almost 100 per cent to 35 per cent:
      </para>
      <para>
       * price increases have stabilised below the Consumer Price Index;
      </para>
      <para>
       * model numbers have reduced from 13 to 8;
      </para>
      <para>
       * average production per model has increased from 28,000 to 45,000;
      </para>
      <para>
       * quality has improved markedly; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * exports increased from $370m in 1984 to nearly a billion dollars last year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Industry Commission commented on the current plan in a recent report, and I quote:
      </para>
      <para>
       In contrast to previous assistance packages for the industry, there have been some important positive developments under the current plan. First, a plan was announced and adhered to-most of the amendments to the plan made subsequent to its introduction did no more than restore adjustment pressure on the industry following the major depreciation of the Australian dollar in 1985 and 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       Second, for the first time in at least twenty years, there have been ongoing reductions in assistance to the industry. Third, the automatic provision of increased assistance to the industry whenever its competitiveness declined has been ended through the termination of import quotas and the local content scheme. Fourth, there has been some rationalisation of production facilities in the industry and the quality of locally produced vehicles has improved. Fifth, since the removal of quotas and reductions in tariffs in 1988, there has been a fall in the real price of both locally produced and imported motor vehicles.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new arrangements announced today reinforce the stability of the previous plan and provide firms with certainty in the assistance framework they will face until the year 2000. Without such certainty firms would be reluctant to undertake the investments needed.
      </para>
      <para>
       They also maintain the policy direction already established by continuing the existing rate of tariff reductions, while making the export facilitation scheme more flexible and rewarding to those firms prepared to make the investments needed to considerably expand their exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will encourage the Australian industry to build on its past achievements of increasing its competitiveness, achieving a higher level of global integration, and improving product quality at reduced prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is not prescribing a structure for the Australian motor vehicle sector. However, companies that limit their operations to Australia will come under increasing pressure from lower tariffs. On the other hand, companies that recognise the opportunities in overseas markets will be assisted by elements of this package.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the new arrangements, after 1992:
      </para>
      <para>
       * tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and original equipment components will reduce to 15 per cent by the year 2000;
      </para>
      <para>
       * tariffs on four wheel drive and commercial vehicles will reduce in line with general tariff reductions; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * the 15 per cent by-law entitlement to duty free import of passenger motor vehicle products will be retained.
      </para>
      <para>
       Export facilitation will be expanded and made more flexible beginning this year, while modified minimum production volume requirements will be in place until the end of 1996. The Government will commence negotiations with State Governments with a view to exempting the industry from offset obligations, and will introduce an improved labour adjustment package.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consistent with the provisions of the Closer Economic Relations Agreement with New Zealand, the Export Facilitation Scheme will not apply on certain exports to that country after 31 December 1992. Consequential issues relating to this decision are the subject of discussions between the two Governments and a further announcement will be made in due course.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Deputy President, since the introduction of the higher rate for the luxury sales tax in May 1990, there has been a dramatic contraction in sales in that sector. Monthly sales are now running at less than a third of the level over the years before the tax change.
      </para>
      <para>
       This has serious consequences on the overall business of these vehicle importers. Vehicle importing is only part of the Australian operations of the larger luxury car companies such as Mercedes-Benz and JRA. These companies also have major bus and truck operations in Australia and are large employers of highly skilled labour, including many apprentices. The downturn in their car sales has put at risk these operations and their capacity to grow in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       They have also been exporters of automotive components from Australia and have been integrating Australia into their world-wide sourcing of automobile components and materials.
      </para>
      <para>
       To ensure that these companies can continue to contribute to the Australian economy the Government has decided to review the higher rate luxury sales tax and to revert to the May 1990 arrangements. These still include higher sales tax of 30 per cent for these vehicles compared with the general vehicle sales tax of 20 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       These automotive industry arrangements will build on the achievements of the earlier motor vehicle plans in a way which will minimise disruption within the industry. The labour adjustment measures which are being put in place will provide the basis for an orderly restructuring process with minimum disruption to the people involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       The success of these arrangements will depend on all those involved in the industry committing to the future. The Federation of Vehicle Industry Unions is committed to improving productivity, efficiency, quality, work processes, the work environment and industrial relations. The ACTU strategy for rationalising unions is important for the vehicle manufacturing industry. The current ACTU policy involves one union at any `greenfield' site. For existing sites, union amalgamations are occurring and the Government expects one manufacturing union in the industry within 12 months.
      </para>
      <para>
       This should ensure a co-operative basis for progressing the constructive initiatives undertaken by the FVIU and lead to a more flexible and highly skilled work force.
      </para>
      <para>
       An independent body will be maintained to monitor progress in the industry and report to the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Textiles, Clothing and Footwear (TCF)
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Deputy President, as part of its review of overall industry assistance measures, the Government has examined the current TCF assistance arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority highlighted in its 1990 State of the Industry Report, it is clear that the pace of restructuring in the TCF industries has not been sufficient for these industries to become more internationally competitive by the end of the scheduled Plan.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been, of course, a spate of corporate failures in recent times, which has caused significant disruption within the industries as some large companies have been placed in receivership. These failures have not been related to pressures arising from the Plan. Equally the recent downturn in the market for TCF goods is also largely a consequence of the general economic downturn, rather than adjustment pressures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although investment levels increased in a narrow range of capital intensive areas immediately following the announcement of the current Plan, this had more to do with implementing necessary investment plans held up awaiting a decision on TCF assistance post-1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Deputy President, there continues to be a pre-occupation with protection levels instead of improving underlying elements of competitiveness such as technology, skills development, quality and service. This is evidenced by the generally poor take-up rate of restructuring assistance available under the Industries Development Strategy.
      </para>
      <para>
       In spite of the general lack of performance of the industry some firms have taken the opportunities to invest and restructure their operations to become more efficient. For these firms the new arrangements will provide continued encouragement. As I have already outlined, the Government is committed to lowering protection levels throughout manufacturing and has put in place further reductions. The Industry Commission has often pointed to the high effective rates of assistance applying to the TCF industries-some 12 times higher than those applying to manufacturing industry generally.
      </para>
      <para>
       To do nothing about TCF tariff levels or quotas would increase this gap without doing anything to improve the TCF industry's performance. There would be a continuing debate about the level of protection afforded to these industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is undesirable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Already, only half way through the current plan, uncertainty has been generated about the post-1995 assistance arrangements. The scheduled Industry Commission Report would generate further uncertainty, divert attention from improving firm efficiency and stall essential investment plans.
      </para>
      <para>
       Accordingly, reductions in protection to the TCF industries will be accelerated and extended beyond 1995.
      </para>
      <para>
       The revised arrangements for the TCF Plan will begin this year and will apply until the middle of the year 2000. This will provide a predictable and stable long-term planning horizon and enable the industry to plan further ahead than it is possible to do at the moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under these new arrangements:
      </para>
      <para>
       * the termination of quotas will be brought forward by two years to 1993;
      </para>
      <para>
       * tariffs will be phased down to a maximum of 25 per cent by the year 2000; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * bounties will be abolished by 1 July 1995, and where appropriate be replaced by tariffs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is also committed to the continued provision of up to $120 million in positive assistance through the Industries Development Strategy over the period until 30 June 1995. Furthermore, assistance to firms under this program will be made more flexible. In addition an Import Credits Scheme will be introduced to assist firms to integrate their operations into the global industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the current plan up to $50 million was allocated to a TCF Labour Adjustment Program to operate over the life of the Plan. While the take-up of labour adjustment assistance has been relatively low to date, the Government will ensure that current provisions are adequate for the needs of displaced workers. The current TCF labour adjustment arrangements and funding levels will be reviewed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.
      </para>
      <para>
       These changes should lead to a larger, more export-oriented textile and tanning industries and smaller clothing and footwear industries capable of producing better products at competitive prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       To ensure that the benefits of the lower tariffs are passed on to consumers, the Prices Surveillance Authority will monitor the prices of TCF goods from the beginning of the implementation of the new phasing arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Bounties
      </para>
      <para>
       There are currently a number of bounty arrangements under which individual recipients may qualify for very small annual payments. Such payments are inefficient and do nothing to enhance industry development and we have decided to institute minimum annual payment thresholds for bounty eligibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       Duty Reductions for Capital Equipment
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has decided to reduce the input costs to industry by removing the import duties on some capital equipment. Action will be taken:
      </para>
      <para>
       * to remove duties on minerals processing equipment not made in Australia;
      </para>
      <para>
       * to extend the coverage of the existing by-law which allows for duty free entry of goods for shipbuilding and ship repair; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * to extend the split consignment provisions to some goods not presently covered.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is disposed to continue a Commercial Tariff Concession System and introduce a by-law to allow duty free entry of state of the art capital equipment not made in Australia in the normal course of business.
      </para>
      <para>
       A final decision on this is subject to consideration of the Industry Commission's report on the Tariff Concession and Bylaw Systems.
      </para>
      <para>
       Anti-Dumping
      </para>
      <para>
       As tariffs continue to be lowered, the Government will not allow unfair competition from dumped imports which damage local industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       A comprehensive review of anti-dumping procedures and the operations of the Anti-Dumping Authority will be finalised by the end of this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Government has taken a number of steps to immediately strengthen anti-dumping procedures by:
      </para>
      <para>
       * speeding up the processing of anti-dumping and subsidisation complaints by Australian industry;
      </para>
      <para>
       * providing better access to the system for Australia's agricultural and horticultural producers; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * ensuring that anti-dumping actions are kept in place for a full three years wherever they are warranted.
      </para>
      <para>
       Developing Country Preferences
      </para>
      <para>
       From 1 July 1992, the preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea will be adjusted for tariff items which are phasing down. Tariffs applying to imports from these countries will be frozen from that date until tariff phasing brings the general tariff down to their levels. Thereafter the general tariff rate will apply to these countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       Agricultural Assistance
      </para>
      <para>
       Tariffs on general agricultural products will be phased down to 5 per cent between 1 July 1993 and 1 July 1996 in line with reductions in protection for the general manufacturing sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has made no decision at this stage on longer term assistance for the dairy, sugar and tobacco growing industries, all of which have inquiries either under way, or foreshadowed, by the Industry Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the interim, however, the Government believes it appropriate that assistance for the sugar industry be brought back on track with the spirit of the 1988 decision, which was altered following a Senate standing committee inquiry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The specific rate tariff for raw and refined sugar will therefore be adjusted from the scheduled $95 per tonne to $76 per tonne at 1 July 1991, and from $70 per tonne to $55 per tonne at 1 July 1992.
      </para>
      <para>
       By maintaining a specific rate tariff, the sugar industry will remain protected in the event of low world prices over this period.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is disposed to reduce assistance over the longer term for dairy, sugar and tobacco, equivalent to those now being announced in other industries. Full consideration of assistance to these industries will follow the Industry Commission inquiries.
      </para>
      <para>
       COMPETITIVENESS
      </para>
      <para>
       The phasing down of tariffs reinforces our conviction that growth and prosperity lie in building longer term competitiveness. Both Government and industry have vital roles to play.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government must provide a competitive environment so that firms operating in Australia are not disadvantaged compared with their overseas rivals. Creating this environment requires, among other things:
      </para>
      <para>
       * an internationally competitive taxation structure;
      </para>
      <para>
       * an efficient transport system;
      </para>
      <para>
       * an education system able to produce a highly skilled work force;
      </para>
      <para>
       * an innovative research and development culture; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * competitive housing and construction industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has already done much in these areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       Announcements in this statement demonstrate the Government's commitment to do more to improve the business environment throughout the 1990s.
      </para>
      <para>
       Governments can influence competitiveness. But only firms themselves can deliver the creativity and drive which build competitive advantage.
      </para>
      <para>
       The management of firms must address the challenges of quality, design, marketing, and research and development.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many firms are already operating in this way. To compete successfully in the 1990s all firms will need to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       Development Capital
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is very concerned at the difficulty that small and middle ranking Australian companies face in raising long term patient finance. A regular flow of such capital is a prerequisite for the development of Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer and I have had discussions with major financial institutions on ways of increasing the availability of development capital. The Government will continue to work with the financial insti- tutions to address the capital issue.
      </para>
      <para>
       Research and Development
      </para>
      <para>
       In the past, Australian public sector research has been excellent but the amount of research and development done by the private sector has been very low by world standards. However, with the introduction of the 150 per cent research and development tax concessions in 1985, industry is recognising the importance of research and development. As a result production is becoming more efficient and exciting new products are being developed and marketed.
      </para>
      <para>
       A strong commitment to research and development is essential if we are to create and maintain the competitive edge necessary for success in the 1990s.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has therefore decided that from 1993 the research and development tax concession will remain permanently at the 125 per cent rate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Availability of this concession on a long term basis will enable the continuation of the research and development syndication scheme. These syndications have stimulated investment in close to market product development.
      </para>
      <para>
       We need to continue to strengthen and develop effective links between research and its application. To this end the Industry Research and Development Board will focus more on the commercialisation of Australian innovations. The objective of obtaining a better return on Australia's investment in research requires continuing analysis of the commercialisation process and identification of barriers and actions needed to overcome them.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has also extended the discretionary grants scheme into the service industries and has made market research an eligible part of a research and development project under the scheme. Legislation will be introduced so that Government business enterprises and Government contractors may be deemed to be Government customers under the national procurement development program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Commercialisation of Public Sector Research
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's public sector research is a national asset capable of playing an important role in our economic development. However we do not yet derive the economic benefit from this research commensurate with the resources devoted to it. Promising public sector ideas are either not commercialised by the private sector in Australia or are developed overseas. This produces a lower return for Australia than might be achieved if they were exported at a later stage of their development.
      </para>
      <para>
       The National Health and Medical Research Council will give increased em- phasis to encouraging commercial developments from research funded by it, and to making scientists more aware of commercial opportunities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also, an examination of impediments in the biomedical area will be undertaken.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has a longstanding commitment to the development of the biotechnology industry in Australia. An area of particular opportunity is the development of applications based on fermentation of agricultural inputs such as sugar and wheat. However, commercialisation of Australia's leading edge research in this area is being inhibited by price distortions in both the domestic and international markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has therefore been decided to support the continued development and com- mercialisation of this technology in Australia through a bounty on citric acid production.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn now to the question of advanced manufacturing technologies. The use of advanced manufacturing technology and advanced manufacturing techniques can make important contributions to industry's efficiency and productivity. We are, therefore, putting in place an advanced manufacturing technology strategy to encourage greater local production and domestic use of AMT products and services. This will assist the necessary process of change and improvement in our manufacturing base.
      </para>
      <para>
       The advanced manufacturing technology development program will support joint projects for research and development, trialling and demonstration of innovative Australian AMT products and services which meet the requirements of local end-users. The program will also improve the take-up of new technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       An amount of $20 million will be committed to the program over four years, commencing in 1991-92. The operation of the program will be modelled on the national procurement development program, but targeted at the private sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       A review has been undertaken of the metal working machines and robots bounty. It is important in maintaining a key industrial capability and will therefore be continued. However, the rates will be phased down over time to align with the level of assistance provided to other industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The bounty will be extended to cater for current and prospective advances in the area of processing technology for new materials. Production of advanced and standard machines will receive uniform treatment under the revised arrangements, including, eventually, a common rate of bounty.
      </para>
      <para>
       International Performance Benchmarks
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian firms need to operate in the most efficient possible environment. However, Australian standards of efficiency in the provision of infrastructure services to business are well behind international best practice.
      </para>
      <para>
       As part of our program to accelerate progress towards international best practice, the Bureau of Industry Economics will undertake, in association with the Business Council of Australia, a major research project on international performance benchmarks of business input services. This study will identify the key services which affect industry costs and develop measures to compare performance against best international practice.
      </para>
      <para>
       Design and Quality
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian products will compete successfully with their overseas competitors only if they are well designed and their quality meets market demands.
      </para>
      <para>
       Quality and design are key determinants of competitive advantage. Increasingly, they make the difference between sales and lost orders.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has supported the establishment of the Australian Academy of Design. More recently the Australian Quality Council has been established as the prime focus for the encouragement and development of quality within Australian companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those companies which achieve excellence in the area should receive recognition for their own achievements and an opportunity to provide a role model for other companies aspiring to excellence.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have decided therefore to increase support to Enterprise Australia, through the Australian Quality Council, for a range of awards which recognise quality achievements by Australian companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will continue to support firms in acquiring skills in the area of design and quality through the National Industry Extension Service program, a joint Commonwealth and State/Territory initiative.

       The Government is disposed not to accept the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations for a ``no defect'' product liability scheme. It will instead be developing a proposal based upon the 1985 European Community Directive on this issue.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will consider shortly a detailed proposal along these lines from my colleague, Senator Michael Tate, Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       EXPORTS
      </para>
      <para>
       Increased exports will help tackle Australia's current account deficit and international debt levels.
      </para>
      <para>
       But if Australia is to prosper and advance through the 1990s we must not only lift exports, we must do it through a greater variety of high value added goods and services.
      </para>
      <para>
       In this way Australia can share in the wealth created by the fastest growing sectors of world trade. Put simply, significant growth in our net manufactured and services exports is a pre-requisite to long term maintenance and improvement of our standard of living.
      </para>
      <para>
       The range of export-oriented measures I now outline will better focus Government resources to meet the needs of Australian exporters. They will help maintain our competitiveness in international markets and stimulate in Australian industry an improved knowledge of Asian language and business culture. Together these measures will expand our contacts and trade with the fastest growing markets of the Asia-Pacific region.
      </para>
      <para>
       AUSTRADE
      </para>
      <para>
       The challenge of establishing or expanding an export market is often daunting in both financial and cultural terms. It can be difficult to identify the best contacts and establish effective distribution chains. In many of the fastest growing markets, especially those in the Asian Pacific area, there are additional cultural and language barriers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Staff from the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE) have in past years performed a valuable role in assisting firms to overcome such barriers, to identify the right contacts and to set up effective distribution networks.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the future, however, more can be done to enhance the effectiveness of these operations. For that reason, an independent review of the agency was instituted.
      </para>
      <para>
       I strongly endorse the Review recommendations and believe that the emphasis on overseas activities, particularly in difficult markets, can be better realised by closer linkage with Australia's diplomatic network.
      </para>
      <para>
       Accordingly, from 1 September 1991, AUSTRADE will come under the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio with Dr Neal Blewett, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, as the responsible Minister. Dr Blewett and I will be jointly involved in the implementation of the Review recommendations over the next six months.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Review, Mr Deputy President, has highlighted the role that AUSTRADE can play in difficult markets. These markets, despite language and cultural barriers and different styles of government administration, have enormous potential for Australian firms. North and South East Asia are of special importance. In future, AUSTRADE will concentrate more of its efforts and resources on this region and less on North America and Europe. AUSTRADE's overseas staff will have greater independence under new management arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Australia, there will be more focus on the needs of businesses, particularly those with high export potential. Those needs are better served by the relocation to Sydney of AUSTRADE's head office and with the transfer of some central office functions to State offices.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finance
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian exporters must have access to competitive financial facilities to be effective, especially in Asia-Pacific markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) has been in operation for almost 35 years. It has a unique role in providing export finance, guarantee and insurance services on the Government's behalf.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the past four years, EFIC has been part of AUSTRADE but the Government now believes it is necessary to re-establish it as an independent statutory corporation with greater visibility, and an extended range of services for exporters. New arrangements will be in place by 1 September and I will continue to have Ministerial responsibility for EFIC.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new agency will have a reorganised financial structure to ensure an adequate backing for its insurance guarantees and lending operations. The Government will provide $200 million in callable capital to supplement existing reserves of some $160 million and this amount will be reviewed in the next few months. The Government's guarantee will continue to underpin EFIC's activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       There will also be enhanced services for exporters. The agency will be able to use interest subsidy arrangements in a more aggressive way to create new market opportunities through Australian dollar financing and through lines of credit for Australian banks offshore.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to the extensive use by international competitors of concessional finance, Australian firms undertaking projects overseas find it difficult to meet performance and other bonding requirements demanded by buyers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will establish a new $50 million facility to cover bonding requirements for firms with a proven record of performance but which are unable to meet the requirements of private bonders. Over a three year period, this facility could provide up to $1 billion in additional export business.
      </para>
      <para>
       Asia-Pacific Fellowships
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Deputy President, to expand our contacts and trade with Asia, we must rapidly increase the number of business people who are fluent in the languages and familiar with the business cultures of that region. While the Government has encouraged the development of Asian language studies in our schools and universities, the benefits to business have not been fully realised.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have therefore decided to introduce, initially on a three year basis, an Asia-Pacific Fellowships program to assist Australian business people to acquire Asian language skills and foreign business experience.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Deputy President, the range of export oriented measures that I have announced today provides an environment which will support the international activities of Australian firms and encourage and assist firms which are not already exporting to take the first step.
      </para>
      <para>
       TAXATION
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Deputy President, today, the Treasurer is announcing a number of changes to taxation arrangements for business.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I noted earlier, the taxation system has a far-reaching impact on firms. Our objective must be to have the most competitive taxation environment possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       A particular concern for Australian business is tax imposts on goods and services which are not borne by competing products in export markets or by competing imports.
      </para>
      <para>
       Wholesale Sales Tax
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to the wholesale sales tax, the current exemptions from wholesale sales tax for business inputs have been broadened to include a wider range of goods used in the range of activities carried out by manufacturers, miners and primary producers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Exemptions will now apply to goods used in:
      </para>
      <para>
       * research, development, engineering or technical design of products and production processes;
      </para>
      <para>
       * production related activities involving the ordering of goods or the controlling or the costing of production processes;
      </para>
      <para>
       * storage, handling or dispatch of own-produced goods; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * the training of staff to perform any of these and other eligible activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       This measure will reduce the cost imposts faced by firms and encourage the adoption of modern manufacturing technologies. It will also reduce administrative and compliance costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Depreciation
      </para>
      <para>
       The current taxation depreciation provisions are complex and inflexible. The following changes will be introduced to assist industry:
      </para>
      <para>
       * effective life will be defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act to take full account of technological obsolescence;
      </para>
      <para>
       * the number of depreciation rate classes will be more than halved to seven;
      </para>
      <para>
       * immediate expensing of items costing up to $300 and items with lives of less than 3 years will be allowed;
      </para>
      <para>
       * the option will be given to business to pool assets within the same rate class for depreciation recordkeeping purposes; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * taxpayers will be able to determine the depreciation rate for their equipment in accordance with the definition of effective life and the self assessment principles.
      </para>
      <para>
       These changes will provide significant scope to reduce accounting burdens by clarifying and simplifying the operation of the depreciation provisions. In addition, the definition of `effective life' should help ensure that lives afforded for tax purposes accurately reflect the actual period an asset can be expected to contribute to the income earning process.
      </para>
      <para>
       Environmental Impact Studies
      </para>
      <para>
       Considerable concern has been expressed to Government in relation to the non-deductibility of costs incurred in undertaking environmental impact studies.
      </para>
      <para>
       In certain circumstances, environmental impact statements are required by law. In other cases these studies are essential to protect the environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       As part of the review of the tax treatment of environment related expenditure (announced in the 1990-91 Budget) the Government has decided that expenditure on environmental impact studies may be written off over ten years or the life of the project, whichever is the lesser.
      </para>
      <para>
       SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
      </para>
      <para>
       Small to medium-sized businesses are recognised internationally as key agents of economic growth and structural change. They are an important source of innovation and new employment. Small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the non-traded sector can also provide a very efficient supporting infrastructure for other larger businesses operating in export markets and the traded sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       To ensure a more strategic and better coordinated approach to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, existing programs and other development measures addressing impediments to business growth will be strengthened and integrated into a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Development Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Program will promote the creation and development of efficient and competitive enterprises by removing regulatory and other impediments to enterprise development and providing appropriate assistance at critical stages of business establishment and growth. The Program will also recognise the need to improve efficiency and productivity across the full range of business activity including manufacturing and service businesses operating in both the traded and non-traded sectors.
      </para>
      <para>
       INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC MEASURES
      </para>
      <para>
       Sectoral Initiatives
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has been prepared to formulate policies in relation to certain industries or sectors that have faced common problems, constraints or opportunities. This approach has generally involved the identification of impediments to improved economic performance and areas where Government action could be effectively used to remove such impediments and build on competitive strengths.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government continues to attach a high priority to identifying and eliminating any remaining impediments which may blunt industry's competitive edge and has decided to establish a special sub-committee of Cabinet to continue this task.
      </para>
      <para>
       Aerospace
      </para>
      <para>
       The aerocomponent industry, which exports over $150 million of high value added products a year, has demonstrated its ability to break into the world market. Assisted by the Government's civil offsets policy, it is now a world-competitive supplier.
      </para>
      <para>
       Future development of the aerocomponents industry needs to be based on the formation of risk sharing ventures with the world's major aerospace firms.Civil offsets are no longer an appropriate mechanism to develop these arrangements. Therefore the Government is currently negotiating with these firms to replace existing civil offset arrangements with longer term strategic agreements. Those agreements will provide Australian firms with access to risk sharing work on a free and fair competitive basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth and State Governments are also intending to establish a scheme to assist smaller aerocomponent manufacturers in reaching the high levels of quality demanded by the risk sharing partners.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the area of aircraft maintenance and aviation services, recent initiatives by ASTA provide new opportunities for growth. Following the Government's commitment to privatise part of ASTA, an injection of equity by Hong Kong's HEACO Corporation and a five year service contract from British Airways make it well placed to expand. It is estimated that over 600 new jobs will be created at Avalon in Victoria.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition ASTA's Avalon airfield facility has the capacity to become a major centre for aircraft repair and maintenance and will have an important role in the future of the Geelong region.
      </para>
      <para>
       Information Industries
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the Information Industries Strategy was launched in 1987, the world information technology market has changed substantially. Hardware has become a commodity and software and services are the most rapidly growing parts of those industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       These changes in the structure of the information industries offer Australian companies excellent prospects for growth. In particular, Australia has competitive software and service companies and these firms have the potential to grow into major international players.
      </para>
      <para>
       The original Information Industries Strategy addressed primarily the hardware side of the industry. Today the Government is announcing initiatives to address the software and services side.
      </para>
      <para>
       The strategy, particularly through the Partnerships for Development Program, has already encouraged transnational companies to increase their long term commercial activities in Australia through commitments to exports and research and development. In 1987, the companies now committed to the Partnerships Program exported $190 million worth of goods and performed research and development worth $63 million. In 1990, their exports had risen to $460 million and research and development to $180 million. The companies are committed to similarly large rises by 1995.
      </para>
      <para>
       The main extensions to the current Government Strategy are in purchasing of information technology, offsets and the Partnerships for Development Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is a major customer of information technology goods and services. As such, it can make demands on its suppliers and influence the development of the local industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       To facilitate this, the Government will rely more on private sector providers of information technology services. It will establish a panel of these companies to service major public sector information technology projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The panel will comprise both local companies and multinational companies that have demonstrated a major commitment to the development of Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is also making some evolutionary changes to the Partnerships for Development and offsets programs. We will expand the range of eligible activities under the Partnerships scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       Partnership will become mandatory for all multinational firms with annual Government sales of over $40 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       Firms with annual public sector sales of between $10 million and $40 million will be expected to enter Fixed Term Agreements with the Commonwealth Government. These agreements will combine elements of the Pre-Qualified Offsets and Partnerships programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will be abolishing offsets for firms with annual sales to government of less than $10 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       A consolidated statement of information technology purchasing policy will also be issued, clearly stating the Government's approach to the acquisition and use of information technology. Measures will be introduced to ensure compliance with these policies by Commonwealth agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is also introducing several other changes to stimulate the local information technology manufacturing sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       It will remove the tariff on printed circuit boards, and extend the Computer Bounty to include these components so local manufacturers are not disadvantaged. It will also extend the Vendor Qualification Scheme for a further three years and widen its scope to cover software as well as hardware.
      </para>
      <para>
       Resource-Based Industries
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government recognises the contribution further development of resource-based industries can make to improving the current account deficit.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the forest and forest products industries, it is the Government's objective, in cooperation with the States, to phase out the export of woodchips by the year 2000 or soon thereafter. This will be replaced by the manufacture of pulp and paper, and other value-added products, for domestic use and export.
      </para>
      <para>
       Underpinning this objective is the introduction of a five-stage Forest Conservation and Development Process, each stage dependent upon the satisfactory completion of the previous steps.
      </para>
      <para>
       With this process in place, companies can proceed with major value adding initiatives with confidence that governments will not act to inhibit their access to forest resources. The process will also ensure that the Government's environment protection policies are well applied.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is prepared to legislate as soon as possible to achieve this outcome.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, an improved process for consideration of other major resource processing projects will be implemented with the establishment of the Commonwealth Major Projects Group. This Group will be the initial point of contact at the Commonwealth level for companies proposing major projects. It will identify and seek to resolve impediments or consider ways in which project development can be facilitated. It will also provide a point of contact on major project proposals with agencies in the States.
      </para>
      <para>
       CONCLUSION
      </para>
      <para>
       Over the last eight years, industry has responded well to the challenges of a more competitive Australia. We cannot relax our efforts to improve our efficiency and respond to the global challenge.
      </para>
      <para>
       In announcing these initiatives today, the Government has sought to promote:
      </para>
      <para>
       * further integration of Australian industry with the world economy;
      </para>
      <para>
       * a more competitive domestic business climate;
      </para>
      <para>
       * better use of the technology and skills of the nation; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * specific measures to meet the needs of individual industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       In all of this, the Government is building upon the foundations of its industry policies to date, in improving competitiveness, efficiency, and the intelligent use of technology for Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government must of course deliver the right environment for the development of a more competitive economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       But it will take the efforts of all Australians to build the society we want to see at the end of the century.
      </para>
      <para>
       Industry, trade unions, management and workers all have their part to play.
      </para>
      <para>
       So do our scientists, our designers, our teachers.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am confident that Australians will respond to the demands of the 1990s and the initiatives announced today to bring about a new decade of greater competitiveness and expanding production and exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       These are the directions towards the establishment of a dynamic economy which will enable us to take up the great challenges and great opportunities available in the region in which we live.
      </para>
      <para>
       I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement by the Treasurer.
      </para>
      <para>
       Leave granted.
      </para>
      <para>
       The statement read as follows--

      <para>
       STATEMENT BY THE TREASURER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP

      </para>
      <para>
       AUSTRALIA''-TAXATION MEASURES
      </para>
      <para>
       The package of measures announced today ends forever Australia's sorry association with the tariff as a device for industrial development.
      </para>
      <para>
       In presiding over such a major transition, the Government through its Industry Minister, Senator Button, has ushered in a new philosophy for Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       By turning its back on tariffs, Australia will be further propelled in its quest for international trade and efficiency, a search begun with the opening up of the economy in 1983 when we floated the dollar and abolished exchange controls.
      </para>
      <para>
       As in all nations before it, the pursuit of trade and competition has instilled in Australia a thirst for greater efficiency at home and a larger dominion abroad.
      </para>
      <para>
       Today's Statement will further serve those ambitions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Within a couple of years, remaining non-tariff barriers will have been completely removed.
      </para>
      <para>
       By the end of the decade, tariffs on motor vehicles and on textiles, clothing and footwear will have been wound back to such an extent that effective rates of protection will be less than a third of their present levels.
      </para>
      <para>
       Across the rest of manufacturing, tariffs will have fallen to a mere 5 per cent by 1996.
      </para>
      <para>
       Within this decade, Australia will have renounced once and for all the fallacious doctrine that prosperity can be found behind the insular wall of protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       The wool industry's problems are only the most recent example of how we deceive ourselves if we think we can ignore the imperatives of the international market-place even in a commodity where we are dominant.
      </para>
      <para>
       Today's Statement completes the program announced in the Economic Statement of May 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       It puts an end to the high tariff culture which did so much to diminish Australia's potential in the post war period.
      </para>
      <para>
       But the decisions announced today do more than complete the transition to an open economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       They will also make our domestic economy more responsive and supple, giving us a greater capacity to compete with imports and produce goods and services at lower levels of cost.
      </para>
      <para>
       But our frontline goods and services can only be competitive if the productive sectors which support them are required to be similarly competitive.
      </para>
      <para>
       The measures announced today by the Prime Minister and Senator Button are designed to improve that prospect, strengthening forever the productive base of the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       As part of that process I also announce today significant taxation reform measures which will further reduce tax burdens on Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, since 1983 the Government has undertaken path-breaking reforms of the Australian tax system, increasing its fairness and economic efficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reforms direct Australia's scarce investment funds to the most economically promising activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Reform of the tax system has attacked tax shelters and discouraged speculation, while enhancing the attractiveness of genuine business projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The closing of loopholes has funded reductions in tax rates and the establishment of a full dividend imputation system.
      </para>
      <para>
       These have removed the bias against corporate equity investment and created a world-class financial system for Australian business.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reformed tax system is an essential foundation for the restructuring and growth of the Australian economy in the 1990s and beyond.
      </para>
      <para>
       Today's Statement builds on our major reforms with further measures designed to simplify the tax system and improve economic efficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       These measures will reduce the tax burden on genuine business activities, particularly those engaged in competition on world markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each measure flows from the basic tax reform direction consistently pursued by the Government and will enhance our competitiveness as a trading nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Wholesale Sales Tax
      </para>
      <para>
       The wholesale sales tax is an important element in Australia's indirect tax system, and has been substantially reformed over recent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       I announced in the 1990 Budget that it would be comprehensively reviewed in order to simplify its operation and to consider further avenues for removing tax on business inputs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given the continuing need for enhanced competitiveness, the Government has given priority to measures to reduce tax on business inputs, as these can operate to disadvantage Australian producers of goods relative to their international competitors.
      </para>
      <para>
       In last year's Budget, I announced a significant widening of the tax relief provided for computer hardware used in manufacturing-related processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has now decided to introduce a major reform to the wholesale sales tax system with a package of changes designed to substantially reduce the tax on business inputs.

      <para>
       A wider definition of production has been adopted so that a wider range of goods used by goods producers can be exempted from sales tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       Activities for which goods will be exempt include:
      </para>
      <para>
       * pre-production activities such as research, development, engineering and technical design;
      </para>
      <para>
       * production-related activities such as ordering raw materials, controlling or costing production processes, monitoring emissions, cleaning premises, lighting and so on;
      </para>
      <para>
       * post-production activities including storage, handling and dispatch in relation to the goods-producing premises, and rehabilitation of minesites; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * staff training in relation to such activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Exemption will also be extended to goods used in the transportation of products by rail, pipeline or conveyor.
      </para>
      <para>
       Restrictions on the range of goods which are exempt under the existing exemption provisions will be eased.
      </para>
      <para>
       When mainly used in eligible activities, lubricants, office furniture and equipment will also be exempt.
      </para>
      <para>
       Hand tools used in agriculture or fishing will be similarly exempt.
      </para>
      <para>
       To reduce the costs of handling goods at sea ports and international airports, exemption will be introduced for freight storage and handling facilities at such ports.
      </para>
      <para>
       Importantly, the exemption provisions will be extended to sub-contractors so that they do not suffer a disadvantage compared with in-house production-related activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The comprehensive new provisions to give effect to these exemptions will be drafted in a plain English style and introduced in the Budget sittings.
      </para>
      <para>
       They will take effect on the date legislation receives Royal Assent.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new exemptions will reduce tax revenues by $200 million in 1991-92 and $375 million in 1992-93.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because input taxes are subject to markups as goods pass through the production chain, this measure will have an even greater impact on production costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The cascade effect of this taxation relief at the input taxing point will induce a cost benefit estimated at up to $700 million in 1992-93.

      <para>
       Depreciation
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, flowing from its tax simplification agenda, the Government is also introducing major reforms to the processes determining depreciation claims by taxpayers for plant and equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       These reforms will have many positive benefits as they provide taxpayers more discretion, greater certainty and enhanced simplicity in dealing with the now complex and often cumbersome task of applying these provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       In essence the reforms:
      </para>
      <para>
       * Legislate to clarify the meaning of effective life.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Permit taxpayers to self-assess the rate of depreciation of plant and equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Reduce the number of rate classes for depreciation from eighteen to seven broad-banded rate classes.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Allow taxpayers to pool items within a rate class for further administrative simplicity.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Permit items below $300 or with a life of less than 3 years to become deductible immediately, to reduce the large accounting task associated with small items.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, the methodology of depreciation is already substantially concessionary.
      </para>
      <para>
       For instance a five year life asset which would be written off at a scheduled 20 per cent a year on a straight line basis can under present arrangements be written off as to 36 per cent in year one under the declining balance system.
      </para>
      <para>
       This means that most of the value of the asset is depreciated within the first two years of its life.
      </para>
      <para>
       The 20 per cent loading previously introduced by the Government facilitates such an outcome.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government does not believe that assets should be written off faster at an even higher budgetary cost.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rather, what is needed is a less arbitrary approach and enhanced simplicity in the application of the law.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amendment to the law to provide greater clarity to the meaning of effective life will give taxpayers a much enhanced capacity to select appropriate write-off periods suited to their circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       The law will specifically refer to factors to be considered in determining effective life, including predictable obsolescence, circumstances of use and the restriction of plant life to the life of a project in which it is used.
      </para>
      <para>
       Taxpayers will continue to be able to appeal a decision by the Commissioner on the effective life of an asset, in the first instance with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, if required, the Federal Court.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, such appeals will now be argued with the assistance of the new definitional criteria and the process of appeal will commence earlier than under present arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       These new processes should see depreciation claims equilibrate quickly with the actual effective lives of assets.
      </para>
      <para>
       Permitting taxpayers to self-assess the rate of depreciation for allowable plant and equipment gives them the freedom to use rates which they believe are more in keeping with the circumstances of the use of the asset.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner of Taxation will however continue to provide guidance on rates of depreciation through private and public rulings.
      </para>
      <para>
       Taxpayers exercising the option to self-assess depreciation rates will be required to annotate their taxation return to that effect.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner will be able to consider the taxpayer's claim. This reform will mean that for items of plant and equipment, both large and small, taxpayers will be able not only to truncate any process of review or ruling by the Taxation Office but may have the more immediate advantage of improved after tax incomes from a more appropriate deduction in the years in question.
      </para>
      <para>
       To ensure that implementation issues are addressed adequately, the detail of the self-assessment system for depreciation will be determined after full consultation between the Taxation Office and interested bodies prior to implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reduction in the number of rate classes from eighteen to seven will also greatly simplify the accounting task for much of Australian business.
      </para>
      <para>
       Broad-banding will make depreciation claims for the myriad of depreciable items at many and varied rates dramatically more simple.
      </para>
      <para>
       Pooling of assets within a rate class will amplify the simplicity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new depreciation arrangements, other than broad-banding and pooling, will take effect for items acquired and first used, or installed ready for use, for income producing purposes on or after 1 July 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       Broad-banding and pooling will be available from the 1991-92 income year in respect of all items, including those acquired before 1 July 1991, while used for income producing purposes, unless the items remain eligible for special depreciation rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       The measures are expected to reduce tax revenues by $100 million in 1992-93, but to have a declining cost in later years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, these reforms will not only materially and beneficially affect the after tax position of a business, they will also provide flexibility and relief from the onerous and costly task of preparing depreciation claims.
      </para>
      <para>
       Environmental Impact Studies
      </para>
      <para>
       I announced in the 1990 Budget a review of the tax treatment of expenditures relating to the environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       That review is continuing, but the Government has decided to announce an initial outcome today.
      </para>
      <para>
       For expenditures incurred after today on environmental impact studies, tax deductions will be allowed over a period of the lesser of ten years or the life of the associated project. The deduction will remove a bias in the tax system against projects requiring such studies and against appropriate environmental assessment processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The cost of this measure will be low initially, but steadily build up to an estimated $45 million per year after ten years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other Tax Measures
      </para>
      <para>
       Some other tax measures form part of the initiatives announced today by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The deduction for eligible research and development expenditures is to be extended indefinitely, with the rate of deduction of 125 per cent to continue after 1995.
      </para>
      <para>
       This extension will maintain strong fiscal assistance to this activity and enable companies to develop their research and development plans on a longterm basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       As part of the arrangements announced for the motor vehicle industry, the wholesale sales tax on luxury vehicles is to be reduced to 30 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is expected to reduce tax revenues by about $15 million in the current financial year, and $45 million in 1991-92.
      </para>
      <para>
       Fiscal Impact
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me now discuss the fiscal impact of the measures announced today.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's approach to budget strategy has been, and remains, keyed to the medium-term requirements of policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       This has involved, first, the need to achieve a Budget surplus, contributing to national savings and easing pressure on the current account.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the same time personal income tax relief negotiated under the Accord has bought further progress in enhancing our international competitiveness, and in successfully tackling inflation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Second, budget formulation has involved sustained efforts to improve the effectiveness of outlays programs, the efficiency and equity of the tax system and the productivity of government enterprises.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, the measures announced today are fully consistent with the medium-term objectives of fiscal policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       In aggregate, the measures will add only $123 million to outlays in 1991-92. The tax and tariff reforms will cost the revenue an estimated $324 million in 1991-92, although this will increase in the medium-term reflecting the full-year cost of the new exemptions under the wholesale sales tax and the phased reductions in tariff duties.
      </para>
      <para>
       These costs to revenue, however, are in the higher service of significantly improving the efficiency of resource allocation in the private sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those improvements will serve to strengthen the nation's income growth, with beneficial medium-term fiscal effects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The package announced today deals with our underlying structural problems without losing sight of current cyclical difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       The present slowdown in economic activity will contribute to a substantial reduction in the surplus this year compared with the record $8 billion outcome for 1989-90.
      </para>
      <para>
       This budgetary response, involving slower revenue growth and increased outlays on unemployment benefits, will serve to cushion the effects of the recession.
      </para>
      <para>
       With similar intent, measures announced to enhance labour market and training programs, at a cost of $45 million in 1991-92, will protect the skills base of the labour force from the effects of the recession and develop that base further.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the medium-term our objective will be to maintain the structural integrity of the Budget so that, as the level of activity recovers, the Budget will further contribute significantly to national savings.
      </para>
      <para>
       In order to meet this requirement the Government will, as usual, carefully scrutinise its spending programs in formulating the Budget for 1991-92.
      </para>
      <para>
       The discretionary outlays measures in this Statement are modest but the Government intends to ameliorate those impacts with measures in the forthcoming Budget round.
      </para>
      <para>
       Such an approach will ensure that the public sector comes out of the present slowdown in much better shape than after any previous post-war recession.
      </para>
      <para>
       Conclusion
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, sustained consistency in rational structural reform has been a hallmark of this Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Today we have yet again demonstrated our commitment to that standard, this time in circumstances of economic adversity.
      </para>
      <para>
       With these measures we complete our transition to an open economy. By promoting a more competitive cost structure we also underpin our transition to a lower inflation path in the 1990s.
      </para>
      <para>
       The process of structural change in this country has been long and arduous.
      </para>
      <para>
       But we have made great strides.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our export sector is now a much larger part of our economy than when we came to office.
      </para>
      <para>
       This package will continue that process and will ensure that as the economy comes out of recession we will have in place the proper ingredients for a firmly based expansion of our economy throughout the 1990s.

       </talker>
       <para in-line="1">
        —by leave-The Hawke Government came to office in 1983 with a clear call for policies of reconciliation and renewal. Australians had grown tired of the divisiveness of the past and anxious for a new era of cooperation so that we could overcome the problems facing us. We needed to rejuvenate the economy and make it more productive. And we needed to pull together so that we could do so. The new Government therefore sought the help of all the interests involved in providing ideas and helping to frame the industry, education and other policies which go to make a reform strategy.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Nowhere were reconciliation and renewal more necessary than in industrial relations where the climate had become increasingly confrontationist in the early 1970s and early 1980s. This climate had to change if the strategy of economic renewal were to be effectively pursued. The industrial relations role in this strategy involved drawing all parties together so that a reform environment could be created in which a productivity culture could be nurtured and made to flourish.
      </para>
      <para>
       All the elements of the Government's industrial relations policies since it was elected have been part of this carefully planned and phased reform program.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Accord has brought about union cooperation in structural change and wage restraint. The Government has actively supported a tripartite consultation process as a central factor in remoulding established institutions to remove impediments to flexibility in the system, particularly at the enterprise level. Rationalisation of the union structure, after many unsuccessful years, is now achieving results which are significant for industry flexibility. The Government has decided to allocate $2 million towards helping unions through the rationalisation process with legal and other costs. This will be in addition to the $2 million it has already invested in the process.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reform environment encouraged by these and other developments is already transforming the way work is performed and rewarded in many areas of industry. From the two-tier days to the current phase of the Structural Efficiency Principle, wage fixing has been linked to changes designed to increase productivity and efficiency. It has been used to force the pace of award restructuring. This is a massive exercise in which job classifications and work organisation which have existed for decades-and even for generations--have been streamlined to bring about reforms to make work at the plant level more flexible and more productive. The achievement should not be underestimated. In the metals sector, for instance, more than 350 narrow, separate job classifications have been cut to 14. In Germany, a similar sized reform took more than 10 years; here it has taken less than three.
      </para>
      <para>
       But, as massive as all these changes have been, the reform program still has to negotiate a significant cross-over point. With the momentum of restructuring continuing, we must manage the decentralisation of wage fixing to the enterprise and bring about a great change in the culture of the workplace.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has invested considerable financial and other resources in encouraging reform at the workplace level. It has put more than $25 million into its Workplace Reform Program which assists training, education, planning and other reform activities and helps fund a national network of workplace resource centres. The Prime Minister has announced today that, in its industry strategy, the Government will invest a further $20 million in this program.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has also decided to press the pace of workplace reform via demonstration projects which will illustrate the productivity gains made possible by the work practices used overseas and by our more enlightened companies. The Government will allocate $25 million over the next two years to this program, the Australian Best Practice Demonstration Program (ABPDP).
      </para>
      <para>
       The program will be administered by me, in association with the Australian Manufacturing Council (AMC). It has been developed following extensive consultations with peak employer and union organisations and enterprises. The scheme will use a competitive bidding process in which firms bid for inclusion. There is advantage in this process in that, for each successful candidate, there will be a significant number of others who have brought about productivity-enhancing change. These spin-offs will be available throughout the life of the scheme as the competitive bidding process is completed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is confident that the process will produce a catalytic effect, stimulating much more widespread change than that displayed by those companies selected. Each demonstration project will be a model for what can be achieved and a hands-on resource on how to achieve the kind of productivity gains made by reformist companies. By this program, the Government wants to galvanise senior management into action, in cooperation with their work force. Only those enterprises which can demonstrate that they are prepared to undertake a comprehensive reform and restructuring program within a reasonable timeframe will be eligible to take part.
      </para>
      <para>
       The successful companies in the competitive bidding process will be selected on the advice of a panel of employer and union representatives. The panel will be chaired by Mr John Prescott, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer-designate of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Chairperson of the Australian Manufacturing Council. Members of the panel will themselves be chosen on the strength of their demonstrated practical knowledge of successful business, a track record in implementing change, and a commitment to the new workplace culture.
      </para>
      <para>
       The difficulty in creating such a culture leads me to make two final points.
      </para>
      <para>
       It can no longer be accepted that workers should leave their brains at the factory gate and pick them up again on their way home. The truly productive company uses its employees' brains as well as their hands. This calls for much wider use of consultation and participation than is ev ident throughout industry today.
      </para>
      <para>
       My second final point is that, though the Government has invested enormous resources in the reform effort over the past eight years, it cannot do the whole job itself. Peak employer organisations and unions have cooperated significantly in the effort. Their cooperation should be reflected more widely and more actively at the workplace and plant level.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government-through the statement today of the Prime Minister-has set out a clear long term vision of a productive, clever Australia. The reforming role to be played in this by the industrial relations system will be significant. This statement is to explain how the system has facilitated reform so far and how it will play its part in the industry strategy outlined today.
      </para>
      <para>
       I commend it to honourable senators. I table this statement and move:

        —In my remarks to the motion to take note of all of the ministerial statements and associated documents, I will concentrate on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) entitled Building a Competitive Australia. As the Prime Minister pointed out, we have awaited this particular statement for some time. In this statement the Government has finally accepted some responsibility for intervention in the economy. In fact, the Prime Minister says:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       But I do not walk away from my Government's ultimate responsibility to manage the national economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the Australian Democrats that is a welcome move. However, to our mind, this statement represents tentative steps in that direction. In my remarks I will indicate those areas which we welcome and those where we have concerns, and my colleagues and I will outline other measures which we believe ought to have been included in the Prime Minister's statement and in the supporting statements of other relevant Ministers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister, having stated that he accepts the Government's responsibility to manage the national economy, goes on, not too far into his statement, to make this point, when talking about questions of trade:
      </para>
      <para>
       However much our competitors might bend or break the principles of fair trade, our own self-interest is served by a steadfast refusal to return to the days of protectionism.
      </para>
      <para>
       What the Prime Minister is putting forward there is, to our mind, a black or white scenario and one which does not allow for any different approach; that is, either a full-blown protectionism-which nobody in this place would stand up and support-or the sort of flat earth theory which this Government is apparently still promoting in terms of overseas trade.
      </para>
      <para>
       Fair trade is in fact what we should be standing up for. There will be many in our community today, especially in the rural community, who will be very concerned by that statement of the Prime Minister, particularly because it is followed by at least a page extolling the virtues of the work that the Australian Government is doing at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but clearly setting out the determination of this Government not to be flexible enough or imaginative enough to deal with the problems of our own industries in the context of an international trading regime which is far from fair at this stage. That is not to say that Australia should not be negotiating strongly towards fair and open trade around the world. It does not exist and there are other considerations which must be met by a responsible government; and to be met, degrees of intervention will be necessary which we do not find in either the Prime Minister's or the other supporting statements.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the point at which the Prime Minister is discussing questions of overseas trade, he refers to new protectionists. I want to make it quite clear at this point that the Australian Democrats do not come into any category thus named. We simply say that it is not enough to take the simplistic view to cut tariffs on a rigid timetable in this way. There is a need for a strategy to increase our industrial capacity and our competitiveness, but it will require more intervention and more imagination than the Government is prepared to allow. My colleague Senator Spindler will detail, in his contribution in the debate as it goes on, our specific measures and ideas in that respect.
      </para>
      <para>
       We must be targeting what we are doing. We must develop sustainable industries, obviously, and our concern here is in the global context. We believe that we need to acknowledge that there is no level playing field and that sustainability must be a major priority. To that end, we will be discussing what we would call an exploitation index which recognises that it is environmental and human exploitation that is so often at the base of the unequal surface of the playing field on which we operate in international trade.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister quite early in his statement acknowledges the fact that we can expect increased unemployment. There is very little else he could do, of course, in the current environment. We have got over three-quarters of a million people currently unemployed. A million is clearly a figure which regrettably we look like reaching. In this context, the statement later on talks about a range of training schemes. This, of course, is welcome. The intention is to spend $74m over two years for work experience for people who are unemployed for over six months; $50m over 15 months to provide pre-vocational training places, for which I hope State cooperation will be forthcoming, because that is a very important part of this Federal Government's program; and $6m over three years to strengthen management skills. That totals $130m to address that obvious unemployment problem, which is acknowledged by the Prime Minister.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) submission which was put to the Prime Minister recently with regard to this major economic statement, in the context of the present high levels of unemployment-and bearing in mind that the figures I have quoted from the Prime Minister's statement are stretched out over up to a three-year period-assesses that in employment and training we would need $130m for work experience and $90m for training programs, plus an additional 600 staff for Commonwealth Employment Service officers, just to meet the needs which are currently there. That does not take account of any increased unemployment which will obviously be occurring as we see the cutbacks in tariffs which are ahead of us. That is a total of what ACOSS terms at least $290m in the employment and training budget for the next financial year. So we do not take a great deal of encouragement from the training scheme's $130m over up to three years, as outlined in this statement. That remains a major area of deficiency both in this statement and in the Government's policies as they stand.
      </para>
      <para>
       ACOSS put to the Prime Minister the need for a bold industry policy. As I say, Democrat initiatives will be outlined by my colleagues but I just put on record the suggestions that came from ACOSS: that we definitely need, for instance, carefully targeted grants and Government participation in pool risk arrangements for new export ventures; national guidelines to increase the proportion of Australian goods and services in government procurement-and, of course, the statement has gone some distance in that direction; and increased resources for Austrade and other trade assistance services, especially for South East Asian markets. There is a mood and an understanding in the community that there is a need for increased government intervention to get this economy moving. It is that mood, obviously, which has been picked up, at least in part, by the Government in making this statement today.
      </para>
      <para>
       While we are talking about the present stresses in the economy and particularly at the human level, we must of course look at the rural scene. The Prime Minister's statement tells us that as tariff reductions occur general agricultural assistance will be reduced in line with the pace of that tariff reform in manufacturing. That is fair enough as a statement. However, while there are still some agricultural areas where there is a high degree of assistance-and I refer specifically to the tobacco industry, where the effective rate of assistance, according to the Industry Commission's most recent annual report, has risen from 24 to 111 since 1986 up to the year 1988-89, something that we should all be questioning-we must look at other commodity areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the potato industry we have a negative rate of effective assistance of minus 3.1. The tomato industry, again, has a negative rate of assistance, minus 1.2. As for some of the extensive cropping areas, in 1988-89 the level of assistance in wheat, one of our major commodity crops and one most stressed at this time, the rate of assistance is 1.4 only; in barley, 0.6; in sorghum, a growing industry, 0; and oilseeds generally, 3.4. As far as many of our rural commodity areas are concerned, the intention to reduce is not going to be a major exercise in terms of the overall benefit to the economy or to government revenue or loss of revenue, but it certainly will be in those stressed rural industries, or has the potential to put enormous further stress on those industries. We suggest that that is something, if we are going to look at targeting and being specific on an industry by industry basis, which should not be done across the board.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister also points out that we can expect the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, to announce in April a rural adjustment package to acknowledge the difficulties that will be experienced by rural people and are being experienced. We must at this stage call for that package to move away from the present situation where rural adjustment is largely there, as it has been historically, to help people off the land in adjustment industry by industry. What is needed in the rural sector at this time in particular is rural adjustment which will help people stay on the land. In this enormously stressed period primary producers of many kinds and in horticultural industries in particular, as well as the major commodities, are not suffering because they are inefficient but because of international factors very much beyond their control, most of them-or many of the significant ones-beyond the control of this Government, including the political changes in the Eastern bloc, the situation in the Middle East and so on.
      </para>
      <para>
       Surely we do not want to force those people off the land and even spend money to get them off it and in the process decimate industries which we need for economic reasons and, of course, for social reasons, as our rural communities run the risk of total disintegration. These are difficult times and they will get more difficult, particularly for people in the rural industries. Any major statement of this kind which does not acknowledge that would be deficient, so we look forward to Mr Kerin's statement with regard to rural adjustment. We welcome the commitment to strong anti-dumping measures. We supported the establishment of the committee which is now looking at that issue, but in that process the Government must acknowledge those hidden supports, hidden subsidies, that exist in that very unlevel playing field in which the rural sector particularly is operating.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now move to the area of micro- economic reform, an area in which I think we had all expected a good deal of extension of information on what is intended and so on by the Government. This section of the Prime Minister's statement gives the clearest indication that this so-called milestone statement is largely just a media beat-up. There is nothing new in this section. What is announced is already happening. We notice that Senator Collins is still the Minister in his area-a very vital area, an area in which we welcome the reforms and developments which have taken place. We congratulate the Government on those reforms and on not being forced, as it might have been by the Opposition, to take a pace which was beyond any rational approach, particularly in the area of the waterfront. But there is nothing new in this statement. The Government appears to be running out of puff on this one. Basically we have huff and puff when it comes to micro-economic reform.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is not a word about rail. We have heard in the past about the development of a national rail strategy. Nothing could be more essential to the development of a sustainable future economy in this country. Surely if this statement is such a landmark, as it was said to be, we should have had some direction pointed out here, some initiatives begun, if this Government was interested in a genuinely sustainable economic future for this country. The trucks are out there ripping up the country roads and contributing to our atmospheric pollution. This particularly efficient, in many ways, form of transport has not been given anything of a push along by virtue of this statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having said that the Democrats welcome much of what is happening in micro-economic reform, I would have to exclude from that the disaster of reform in the telecommunications area. The introduction of competition on what is a blind ideological process is at a great cost to the community, a cost to service, and a cost to our local industry. After all, a large part of what we have been given today from the Government is supposed to be about the development of industry in this country, particularly the export industry, yet all of the evidence shows that the track down which the Government is going in telecommunications is a disastrous one.
      </para>
      <para>
       We were reminded of that on 4 March in the Australian Financial Review in an excellent article by Peter Roberts in which he pointed out specifically that in those nations where this deregulation approach, this competition approach, has been taken, local industry has suffered. I quote from that article:

      </para>
      <para>
       There is nothing in the Prime Minister's statement to commit the OTC-Telecom combined carrier or a new carrier to that sort of procurement policy. All we can say is that this statement is therefore confirmation of the worst fears that this disastrous telecommunications policy will also be a disaster for a major sector which has massive export potential, particularly in our region, about which a great deal of lip-service is paid in this statement. That is an area of massive deficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       Still in the communications area, an Aussat driven deal is being put forward to introduce pay television when two of our commercial operators are in receivership. This push is totally irrational. There is no sense of economic or social responsibility in that sort of approach. Yet, that is the direction in which the Government is going. Although there is nothing new in this statement, there are moves that are to be welcomed in some aspects of micro-economic reform. In other areas, the Government is clearly rushing down a disastrous path.
      </para>
      <para>
       In his statement, the Prime Minister talked a little more about structural change in the economy. He referred to the Trade Practices Act as the principal legislative weapon to ensure that consumers get the best deal from competition. If it is a sword, I would say that it is hardly out of its sheath and it is about as blunt as the Government's rhetoric. This is an area where the Democrats want to see more action; it is an area where we will be promoting more action, as we have in the past. We are reliant on a subcommittee of the Cabinet structural adjustment committee and the State Premiers in terms of the process of new federalism. So how can we really have confidence in this process?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister and, in more detail, Senator Button make the point that the Government has rejected product liability. This matter has been fobbed off again to a later date and, in our view, we are left with an inferior proposition. It is interesting that this announcement in Senator Button's statement comes immediately after his discussion about the need to promote quality in our industry. The Democrats believe that that is a major negative in this statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister says a good deal about inflation and the success in that area. The Government has brought about a small reduction in inflation through its induced recession which we are suffering at the moment at human cost and long term damage to many key industries. The Government could have achieved this reduction, and probably more, had it reduced asset price inflation through financial regulation. Financial deregulation has been a disaster. We are clawing back in inflation terms only part of what has been caused by this Government's policy. In speaking about the accord and wage restraint, Senator Cook did not mention that there has been no control of management salaries under that system. Blow-outs in that area need to be dealt with. That is a matter which the Government cannot be congratulated on at all.
      </para>
      <para>
       In his statement to the Parliament, the Prime Minister made the point that this Government has done more than any other to reform the taxation system so that, as far as possible, tax considerations do not distort investment decisions. The Democrats agree that some important tax reform measures have been implemented during this Government's term of office-fringe benefits, capital gains tax and so on. Those measures have been supported by us. We agree that the tax system should be used to effect structural change through investment decisions so that they fit in with the direction in which we want to go. We believe that it should be an instrument by which the Government promotes sustainable development.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, we support the tax initiatives that are in the statement-the widening of exemptions from sales tax for business inputs and the overhaul of depreciation provisions to bring them into line with business realities. In particular, these measures come into the category of positive tax reforms by this Government, which my colleague Senator Spindler has been pushing very strongly for since he has been in this place. But there is nothing in the statement about the use of the tax system to encourage, for instance, pollution control by effecting a polluter-pays policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Democrats put the Government under enormous pressure, which finally resulted in the removal of sales tax from recycled paper. A new developing industry has now been given a boost by that process. Senator Spindler has attempted a similar approach in respect of recycled plastic. Again, this potential industry has enormous social and environmental benefits. As the Government has not stated that it will do that or given us any encouragement, we shall continue to apply pressure as we did on the issue of sales tax on recycled paper. These are just a couple of examples of the growth industries of the coming decades. There are many others, which I am sure my colleague Senator Coulter will mention, which could and should be developed, encouraged, assisted and supported through the tax system.
      </para>
      <para>
       A good deal was said in the statement today about the motor car industry but we did not hear a word about developing fuel efficient cars, about alternative powered cars. Again, I know that Senator Coulter will refer in detail to the ideas of the Democrats in that area, which are not encompassed in the Prime Minister's statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The statement also referred to the disaster of the removal of the sales tax on luxury cars. This tax ought to be extended to other luxury imports. Our problem is one of too many imports. This is the sort of tax that, if the Prime Minister really means what he says about the use of the tax system, the Government should not be removing but extending.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will not spend very much more time talking about the resource security approach which has been taken and which was already in the public arena before this statement was made. My colleague Senator Coulter will deal with that. But I want to say that this approach would not even be necessary if we genuinely had a government which understood the reality of sustainable development which equals genuine resource security; not a short term exercise which protects an already heavily subsidised industry, which the proposal for the forest industry is, but genuine long term security for all members of the community and for future generations.
      </para>
      <para>
       A good deal was said about cooperation with our regional neighbours. That is essential and the concept is welcomed. But care will need to be taken in our foreign policy and defence postures if this is to bear fruit. We must not strut the Pacific stage like big brother. We must not only be looking at industry and economic policies. We must look at other policy areas if we are genuinely to forge good relations in our region which will have an economic benefit to us all.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have said, the Prime Minister's statement represents something of a breakthrough in that the total costs of $33m in the first year, $446m in the second year and $854m in the third year are basically increases in industry assistance. Of course, we welcome that as an acknowledgment, at least in part, that government has a responsibility to intervene in the economy in the interests of the kind of society in which Australians deserve to live. However, the direction that the Government intends to take us is, no doubt because of the tentative nature of this, unclear. Sustainability, either social or environmental, is not an issue in this statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       We welcome the direction and some of the specific moves, many of which I have already mentioned. We note the Opposition's non-response today. It, of course, does not provide an alternative. The Democrats have substantial alternatives and they will be detailed by my colleagues as the debate proceeds.

         —At long last we now have the opportunity to consider the other side of the coin because what we have had so far today, and indeed what we have had for most of the past eight years, has been failed attempt after failed attempt to get the economy right. Unless the Government gets the economy right, it is really not in a position to do anything about the social consequences that follow. It has to be said time and time again that the best antidote to poverty is employment. Yet, what we now find is that, after all the anguish and toil and the gymnastics from the great showman, from the world's greatest Treasurer through to the world's greatest recession engineer, it has all been for nought. What we now have is levels of unemployment as high and dole queues as long as they were in the early 1980s.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This Government has always prided itself on its commitment to social justice as though it had a monopoly on compassion and concern. The Australian Democrats, of course, are also past masters of this. But there is not much point in having that concern unless one has practical policies to do something about it. The Democrats' idea of doing something about it is to throw money at it-large dollops of money which they do not have and which they do not have the responsibility of raising-which, of course, just compounds the problem. The solution is, as this Government knows in its heart of hearts, to restructure the economy-to bite the bullet, to create more jobs and to provide the opportunities that people really want. People do not want to be put on welfare. By and large, people do not want to get benefits, allowances and handouts. They ought to be a last resort. They should certainly not be a first resort. People should not really be put in that position.
       </para>
       <para>
        The approach of the Government ought to be to provide as many opportunities as possible for people to help themselves. If it had done that, by having a competitive economy, a growing economy that leads to increased capital investment and more job opportunities, we would not have the magnitude of welfare problems that we have in this country at the moment. That is the great tragedy-not just the pathetic non-event that has been launched today by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I think we all noted who launched it in this place. It clearly was not the person who ought to have been representing the Prime Minister. There is a very good reason for that. That person could not bring himself to address the hypocrisy contained in the statement put down on behalf of the Prime Minister. There is just one small example that I found particularly instructive that is contained in the following passage, where Senator Button said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Other countries have been assiduous in their pursuit of reforms . . . That is why we in Australia have to do more. We have to change faster.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet, when we turn to the Prime Minister's statement, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Those who for more than a generation in office entrenched the inadequacies of the past and themselves effected no change whatsoever, now with an hypocrisy that is truly breathtaking, clamour for even greater change.
       </para>
       <para>
        So on the one hand we have Senator Button saying that we have to change faster and on the other hand we have the Prime Minister saying that it is truly breathtaking hypocrisy to clamour for greater change. That characterises the extraordinary contradiction between the rhetoric of this Government in professing to have achieved breathtaking micro-economic reform and the reality that it has managed to achieve virtually nothing in that area. It was the catchcry of the third term of government; it was the catchcry of the fourth term of government; it is now the catchcry of what is laughingly called `building a competitive Australia' when we do not even have a solid foundation let alone an edifice about which we ought to crow.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the tragedy of it. Whilst the Government knows that it ought to be about structural change and micro-economic reform, it really has not been prepared to even embark upon that process. Because the Government is not interested in real reform on the waterfront, because it is not interested in anything other than mickey mouse telecommunications restructuring, because it is not prepared to embrace flexible labour market policies and because it is too afraid of what the union movement might say, we have an ossified economy. We have a structure that is making us fall further and further behind our competitors, not only in this region but elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        The end result of that policy paralysis is that we have social consequences that are getting greater and greater by the passing day. That is the point of our matter of public importance and the issue that I am sure exercises the minds and hearts of all Australians. No-one wants to see people getting in the dole queues; no-one wants to see them going to voluntary agencies and asking for handouts; no-one wants to see them ringing rural counsellors in the bush because they are out of work, their income has gone down dramatically and there is no hope in sight; no-one wants to see pensioners having to rely on the advice of financial investment service counsellors; no-one wants to see people going to government departments looking for mickey mouse training schemes and all sorts of methods of keeping people out of the labour force. They want to be in employment. They want to be doing something useful and constructive. They want to have a bit of self-worth and self-esteem. They want to contribute to the economy-not simply take government handouts.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why it has all come unstuck for this Government. What we will see, and what we will develop over the next few days, is an analysis of the Government's latest effort at tackling this problem- almost everything but structural change. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being thrown into make-work projects.
       </para>
       <para>
        One thing that struck me as very puzzling, and it came up today in Question Time, is that less than six months ago Senator Richardson was saying, `I think it would be very difficult for us to try to upgrade training for the unemployed. I am not certain that there is room in the system for more expansion, even if you could find the money'. Well, the Government found the money; it simply decided that Budget surpluses did not matter any more-that $8.1 billion ought to be translated into a likely deficit. It thinks that one can buy one's way out of a recession. But one cannot, and we know that. The Government can create as many schemes as it likes for keeping people out of the work force and massaging the numbers, but at the end of the day it will simply compound the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what we are seeing at the moment, by way of response to Mr Keating's masterful engineering exercise. There is simply no hope in sight as a result of the statements that have been made today. Therefore, we have to ask ourselves why it is that, with a social security budget in excess of $23 billion, that money cannot be used more productively. Why do we have to have $73m, or 14 per cent of the payroll of the Department of Social Security, being spent on training employees of that Department, when in most instances those regional office people last in the job for little more than 12 months?
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of this money is going on people who have no use for it because they will be quitting the system. Ultimately about half of the total work force of 16,500 are the beneficiaries of these training schemes, travel allowances and all sorts of lurks and perks and a sum of money approaching $100m in the present year could have been spent on the alleviation of their poverty. It is money that did not have to go to the bureaucrats but it has.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most offensive items-and I think that my colleague Senator Chapman will give us a practical example of this tomorrow-is the $11.5m that is being spent by the Department of Social Security on promotional projects. I could not believe that this Department is actually printing balloons, sunshades, fridge magnets, wall charts and a whole range of things that are utterly useless when it comes to its sole professed purpose in life, which is income transfer payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I used to get stuck into Telecom for promoting itself when it was a monopoly and wasting around $30m a year on telling everyone what a great job it was doing when we all knew that it was doing quite the opposite. However, I find it morally offensive that, when we are prepared to have a Department of Social Security committed to the alleviation of poverty, or hopefully to its amelioration at least, it spends money on these sorts of self-congratulatory exercises. That is flaunting the bureaucrats' wealth in the face of those who are desperately in need of assistance, and they are everywhere around us.
       </para>
       <para>
        One does not have to go to the local Commonwealth Employment Service office or Department of Social Security office to see people queued up on the footpaths, and quite often being kept waiting deliberately because that is a way of discouraging people. One has only to go to the voluntary agencies to see the massive increase in demand that has occurred in recent weeks and months.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Brotherhood of St Laurence has reported that in January its material aid service in Frankston, Victoria, assisted 394 people but was unable to assist another 154 people because of insufficient stocks of clothing and furniture. The Anglican Community Service at Elizabeth in South Australia reported that in January 197 people were given assistance, but another 540 had to be turned away. The Salvation Army's welfare centre in Adelaide gave away more than $23,000 in food and vouchers in January and $17,000 in February to 1,624 people-more than double the amount for the same period last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sydney City Mission reports that it is having to turn away 20 people a day at its Campbelltown centre, and the story is similar at other centres in Green Valley, Mount Druitt and Wollongong. The mission's 26 senior staff have agreed to take a voluntary pay cut of 10 per cent over the next four months to allow for more funds with which to aid its clients. The mission says that 20 per cent to 30 per cent of families coming in for financial counselling are in trouble because of retrenchment or reduced income owing to the recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the face of all that we have had on two occasions-one in response to a question by Senator Lees-Senator Richardson saying quite blithely `No, we are not thinking of giving any more money to voluntary agencies because they have not asked for it. Indeed, if they want to come to talk to me about it, I will be very interested to hear from them, but I cannot vouch for my colleagues. Perhaps they have approached others'. If he did not know, he ought to have known.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the Australian Council of Social Service approached Mr Staples over a month ago asking for a grant of $7.5m to be given to the voluntary agencies to assist them in immediate and practical income and poverty relief. The answer from the Minister's office, as reported in today's newspapers, was that a decision was still pending and was likely to be made sooner rather than later. What an appalling and cynical response. If ever one wants to see an indifferent government, one has only to look at that type of reaction.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that the Government does not want to provide assistance through voluntary agencies because it will lose control of the process. Never mind that they are the people at the coalface who understand the level of need and are the people best placed to provide assistance. Never mind that the voluntary agencies are very well regarded by ordinary Australians and that people are much more prepared to consult with non-government organisations than they are to confide in bureaucrats. Despite the propaganda, we know that that is clearly the fact with the family income supplement scheme where pensioners are literally terrified that any information which they provide will be taken down in evidence and used against them. This Government is acting in this way for purely ideological reasons. There are those in its ranks who believe that volunteers and voluntary organisations are not quite the right way to go because somehow they exploit people and should be paying their employees twice as much as they are getting, so bureaucracy is better.
       </para>
       <para>
        That sort of approach in government clearly is alive and well to the extent that the real need as measured by those on the ground, the voluntary agencies, is being totally disregarded by this Government. That is what we mean when we talk of a cynical disregard for the tragic human consequences of this deliberate recession. It is not something that has just come about. We know that from the Treasurer's own mouth. Despite the fact that he has had eight years to get it right, all that we are being offered today by way of a statement is promises of more to come. I understand that the Government intends to establish yet another subcommittee of Cabinet to look at structural change. It is pathetic to think that somehow one can buy off the Australian people by promising to set up even more committees and structures and not bite the real bullet.
       </para>

        In the Weekend Australian, Alan Wood pointed to two obvious and easy ways of measuring progress on micro-economic reform. One was trans-Tasman trade, if one were prepared to free that up, and the second was the third runway at Sydney airport. That is what business has put to this Government as the benchmarks. These things are easily achievable, and there have been endless reports showing what needs to be done. Therefore, there is no logical or economic reason why they cannot be accomplished immediately. The only objections are political. That is why they have not surfaced. That is why we have not heard a word about them. That is why there will be no progress in terms of economic recovery. Of course, eventually one day we will come out of a recession, because no recession lasts indefinitely any more than do boom periods.

One does not have to look at the statistics, which show: the number of people who have been out of work for more than 12 months rose by more than 30 per cent over the last 12 months to January; the unemployment rate in January rose by another 26,000, in other words, about 1,000 a day; the number of people unemployed in Victoria has risen by over 10 per cent since April 1983, just after this Government came to power, and the same figure generally applies in other States; and Australians have been joining the dole queues at a rate which now sees over half a million people receiving unemployment benefits, many more than the 455,000 predicted in the Budget.

        They are the figures that one cannot encapsulate in human terms in the course of a debate, but anyone who walks the streets, particularly the western suburbs of the major cities, will be made acutely aware of the position. Certainly those who come from rural areas will have been made acutely aware, by means of phone calls and meetings that people attend, of the anguish that is alive in the bush at the moment over the wool and wheat debacles. This is compounded by the fact that there are literally no job opportunities, no ways of people rescuing themselves from government-induced predicaments.

        Yet all of this money is being squandered in all sorts of other ways. For example, the $45,000 that was paid to Cleo to assist the Australian Council of Trade Unions to advertise itself to women was an obscenity. But we have not heard a word of apology from this Government. Rather, we have heard almost a boast that this is the sort of thing that ought to be tried in other places.

        I do not suppose that the Senate is aware that the Department of Social Security is presently spending $40,000 on a feasibility study to determine whether it should have a corporate uniform. A few years ago Qantas Airways Ltd got bagged on this, and so too did Australian Airlines Ltd. However, that has not stopped the agency that is supposed to be providing income support payments for those who are sick and unemployed from spending $40,000 on a feasibility study for corporate uniforms. I do not need to go on much more about those sorts of waste and extravagance.

        The tragedy is that the numbers now receiving benefits do not need to be anywhere near as high as they are. It is not just a matter of throwing more money at the problem. It is a matter of freeing up the system and having a flexible labour market that would enable many able-bodied people who want to work to actually get into the workplace.

       <para>
        I am delighted that the Government is now talking about training wages and other support programs, which are the thin end of the wedge and which presumably the trade unions will hit on the head as soon as they recognise them for what they are. It has taken the Government eight years to start to go down that track and it simply has not been prepared to bite the bullet to date. As a result, we will have more and more stories of heartbreak from non-government organisations, detailing to us in graphic terms what the ordinary citizens are incapable of expressing other than in the privacy of their own homes. The occasional person who bursts into tears during a radio interview is really symbolic of mass human tragedy that results, in many ways, from deliberate Government policy. This Government will have a lot to answer for to Australian society in the years to come.

         —We have once again in one of these matters of public importance a speech which indicates the important distinction between talking about important things and saying something important. Important as the subject matter we are talking about is-Australia's present economic circumstances and its human consequences-and eloquent as Senator Alston always is, there was nothing new in what he said. He did not put forward one proposal on what should be done about the human consequences of the recession. In fact, his speech was all about people receiving too much assistance-not too little. It was about an attack on public servants and the conditions under which they work, as if somehow or other that would resolve the problem. It was all about trifling around the edges.

        No-one can deny the significant human cost involved in any recession. Recessions hurt people. It is an inevitable consequence. As the economy gets smaller, we obviously cannot all be better off. What is more, the burden falls unfairly. As Harold Wilson once said, even if unemployment is only one per cent, the individual concerned is 100 per cent unemployed. The significant human costs at the moment are very real, and it is government's obligation, firstly, to try to implement policy to bring us out of the recession and, secondly, to try to compensate and assist people who are carrying the burden of the recession.

        However, we need to somehow put the current economic circumstance in context. We get these wonderful figures thrown around on how the economy has been in a mess for the past eight years and whatever. I do not happen to have with me statistics on the past eight years. I have with me a document that many honourable senators will be familiar with-the monthly economic and social indicators put out by the Parliamentary Research Service of the Parliamentary Library. It uses as its cut-off point the 1986-87 financial year. That is why I will use that figure, not because it is particularly advantageous to the Government-we would actually be better off going back to 1982-83.

        Even though no-one can deny that the economy is in recession, and that is a bad thing, let us have a look at the situation relative to July 1986. Since July 1986-and Senator Alston correctly says the best antidote for poverty is employment-there has been an increase in the number of jobs in this economy. Notwithstanding that we are now losing some of that gain, the net increase from July 1986 to January 1991 is 838,000-an increase of 12 per cent.

        People talk about the great crisis of the decline in manufacturing production, and I heard Senator Boswell interject about it earlier today. Manufacturing production has increased by 16 per cent since 1984-85. None of those statistics are put in to in any way say that the economy is not in recession and that Australians should not be concerned about it or its economic and social consequences. It is simply to say: let us not pretend that somehow or another there have been eight years of disaster. We have a recession, but it is a recession that has followed from seven years of enormously high growth-much higher than in the countries with which we normally compare ourselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Alston did, I want to briefly outline some of the relevant features from the industry statement that relate to this particular debate, to make some comments about the continuing attempts by the Opposition to have it both ways, to give some examples of Government initiatives to assist those in greatest need, to highlight that contrast in the time available, and to try to bring together some of those economic and social policy questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the statement made in the Senate on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by the Prime Minister himself in the House of Representatives and released publicly, there are some important short term measures to deal with the impact of the recession and the process of adjustment to a more competitive economy, particularly some important initiatives in the area of labour market adjustment and training. This is another of the very many contrasts we find with the circumstance in 1982, when we came out of that recession. Not only was it a recession that in many ways was significantly worse, but we came out of it with our skill base fundamentally eroded.
       </para>
       <para>
        So those labour market adjustments and training initiatives in the statement, consciously included as part of the package of reform and restructuring, are designed to soften the impact in human terms. I reject the criticism that somehow or another this is an inappropriate way to try to assist people in a recession. It is very appropriate that we provide extra labour market adjustment to keep apprentices in employment, to keep trainees in employment, and to encourage employers by giving them greater assistance to employ apprentices and others so that as we emerge from the recession-as we certainly will-we emerge with the skill base intact and do not put those stresses on the labour market and do not find the bottlenecks in shortage of skilled labour that we did as we emerged from the 1982-83 recession, which caused significant labour market problems with inflationary and other consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those measures in this statement complement the fundamental medium term focus of the statement by putting in short term labour market adjustment and training measures that will both soften the impact of the recession in human terms and ensure that the economy comes out in a better condition to cope with the upturn than after previous recessions. That is compatible with a number of other things that are taking place in terms of getting some gain out of all the pain and trying to ensure that the economy emerges from the recession in better shape than it did in the past. Those are matters we have debated before; I do not think I will have the time to deal with them today.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement also contains reference to the package that will be handed down in April on rural adjustment to ameliorate the impact of that crisis. It is obvious that many of the problems in the rural sector are more of an international nature than a product of the Australian recession. However, that does not make them any the less painful for the individuals who are suffering their consequences. It does not stop the fact that they will have adverse social and economic effects flowing through the Australian economy and society because of the importance of the rural sector. So that rural adjustment package will also be important. I have briefly referred to those parts of the statement today because otherwise they may not have been taken into account in this day's considerations.
       </para>
       <para>
        We once again find, in dealing with this matter and in listening to Senator Alston and his predecessors who have moved similar matters of public importance over the last fortnight, that the Opposition tries to have it both ways. It says, `We are going to be very macho in fiscal policy. We are going to cut $3 billion off outlays, and half of it will come from cutting people off the dole. But we are also concerned that the Government is not sufficiently concerned about the human consequences of the recession'. It wants to appeal to the small government constituency who say, `Get out there and beat down the government outlays from their already record low. Go out there and tighten fiscal policy further', even though they know that will kill off any recovery in the economy. At the same time, it wants to hide behind a mask of compassion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has said that, in government, the Opposition would cut expenditure by $3 billion and $1.5 billion of that would come from restricting access to the dole. That is a great exposition of concern for the tragic human consequences of the recession. We had the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his previous role as shadow Treasurer, saying that the long term unemployed should live by their own means. That is fairly easy to say if one owns sports cars, restaurants and all those sorts of things, but it is not easy for the long term unemployed to be told that they have to live by their own means.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that that $3 billion cut would substantially worsen the Australian recession. It would snuff out the insipient recovery that we have. The only good fortune that we can see is that there will be no opportunity for those opposite to implement that proposal. But we can try to look for some indication of where that $3 billion might come from. Across the Tasman the conservative Government of New Zealand came in with a similar sort of macho rhetoric. We find that in its Social Security Amendment Bill it has displayed great concern for the tragic human consequences of the recession! It has axed the dole for 16- and 17-year-olds. It has cut $NZ35.40 per week off the unemployment benefit for those aged under 25 and made substantial cuts for those over 25. It indicated at the weekend that it will look for more savings by cutting superannuation payments to people in New Zealand and making a whole line of other draconian cuts. That Government reflects that great compassion that we also see in the conservatives here! It was most starkly illustrated by one of the great quotes of modern political life, when the Police Minister, of all people, in New Zealand urged people to grow silverbeet instead of collecting welfare cheques.
       </para>

        We have the sort of simplistic nonsense that somehow or other if only people would wander out and take care of themselves there would be no need for further assistance and therefore we could make massive cuts in welfare payments and still profess compassion and concern for those in greatest need.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the redeeming features of Australian democracy is that political parties that tend so grossly to underestimate the intelligence of the voters tend to pay the price. Voters do see through double standards like that. They do know that one cannot pose at one and the same time as the pillar of fiscal rectitude and as one with concern for the tragic human consequences. They know that the whole equals the sum of the parts. We cannot try to reduce the size of the cake and say that we are going to make everybody better off. They do see through an entirely negative approach. That is what we have seen today.

        One of the interesting things to speculate about is what poor old Opposition members are going to do when the economy picks up. They will be absolutely bereft of things to talk about because they have nothing positive to say. They are always in here talking about the recession. They must have been absolutely distraught today when they started to find newspaper headlines saying, `Signs of slump moderating', and `Figures suggest economy is ready to begin growing again'. I am not crowing about those small indicators of possible future improvements. It is far too early. I do not wish to be misinterpreted as saying that the economic problems are behind us. I am simply saying--

         —Not however one pronounces it. I am simply saying that the Opposition is taking a totally negative approach in the almost endless series of matters of public importance that we have been facing recently. How bereft it is of policy will be displayed when the economy picks up, as it inevitably will. We find, as I have said before, that most of the economic commentators are expecting the economy to pick up during 1991 and predicting a healthy rate of growth in 1992.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have referred before to the Westpac Banking Corporation's Market Insights magazine of March 1991, in which the bank indicates that it is expecting in 1992 real growth in gross domestic product of 2.8 per cent with inflation at 4 per cent. It would be a remarkable achievement if it were to be true-to have that growth combined with inflation at that low level. That is not an unreasonable prediction from a very competent and impartial observer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to take a little time-I have only a few minutes left-to look at some of the social expenditures undertaken by this Government that deal with what this matter of public importance is supposed to be about, although Senator Alston did not make much reference to it; that is, the consequences for those individuals who are carrying a disproportionate burden of the cost of the recession. It is always the case that some individuals do that, because unemployment inevitably cannot be distributed equally. Of course, there are individuals who are suffering loss of income in other ways and households which might have gone from two incomes to one. They are not suffering the same sorts of consequences as in previous recessions, where we had households losing their sole breadwinner, but it is still a very significant social and economic problem for those families.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not have time to go through all the issues that one might consider and contemplate the consequences of the Opposition's proposals for cutting $3 billion from outlays and its other policies as enunciated. But for many of those families one of the very important factors is the availability of child-care. They may previously have had two incomes and now be down to 1 1/2, or one if they are battling, but there is still the capacity to take advantage of some of the enormously increased numbers of government-funded child-care places that have been made available. One of the most fundamental underpinnings of the social wage, of social conditions in which families under stress find themselves, is services made available to them by Medicare; the guarantee that they will be able to afford to take care of the health of their children without being left by the wayside, as has occurred in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been very fundamental income support measures introduced as a consequence of the 1987 election promises, highlighted by the family allowance supplement, and also the benefits that are flowing to many families in need through the child support scheme. Those two things have done a lot to enhance the income level of families in greatest need in Australia. They are reforms of which the Government is justifiably proud. But income support measures alone will never be enough. They will not eliminate all the social problems that families have. They do not deal with all the social wage aspects that a government would wish to have.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other measures are provided for, such as improvements in housing and education. We have already seen the important statistics about the jobs, education and training program; about, as I have said, the child support scheme; about rent assistance for low income families; and about the provision of more public housing. All these, and the initiatives that today's statement has reflected in the area of training and labour market adjustment, will assist families to cope with the difficult and harsh consequences of the recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today's economic statement by the Prime Minister, and the supporting statements by the other three Ministers, is primarily a question about medium term strategy, and that is appropriately so. The recession is not going to finish tomorrow because of anything stated today. The leads and lags in economic policy take much longer than that, as all sensible commentators know. The initiatives that have been taken with regard to lowering interest rates, tax cuts and the countercyclical impact of fiscal policy are working to bring the economy out of recession, and will do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is appropriately and primarily a medium term strategy document; and that is what the economy needs. But it does have some of the short term measures to which I have referred that will both ameliorate the human consequences of the recession and bring us out of the recession in a healthier state with regard to our skill base. There are important other social justice initiatives that the Government has taken over the last eight years which continue to have that effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tragic as the recession is, the human consequences for the individuals most adversely affected are ameliorated in a way that no party that professes concern can deny. By proposing to cut $3 billion from expenditure, the coalition would crush the life out of the economy. It would crush many of the families who would have to bear the consequences of its policies. It is that combination of economic and social policy, of medium term and short term initiatives, that is a government's responsibility in response to a recession, and that is what the Government is doing.

         —I would like to begin on a positive note, if indeed that is possible in view of the topic we are debating this afternoon. I think we have an all-party agreement on two issues. Firstly, employment certainly is a solution. If we were able to maintain full employment-which should be the goal of any government-we would not find ourselves looking at the misery and other human consequences of this recession. Indeed, we would simply not have a recession.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second issue is that certainly people do not want to have to go through the indignity, the demeaning, arduous and difficult processes-as Senator Alston highlighted-of having to wait for perhaps two or three hours to obtain social security benefits. People do not choose to go through that process. There is a common community perception that somehow they are a drain on the system; that they are, to use the term, `dole bludgers' and all the other connotations that unfortunately this society continues to put on people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in need of support.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, we have considerable disagreement with the Opposition on the way in which we need to treat the people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in need of welfare support. The matter of public importance states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's cynical disregard of the tragic human consequences of the recession, `We had to have . . .'
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats have no problems with the fact that there is a very tragic human consequence. Indeed, the Government itself has admitted that this recession has led to considerable hardship, particularly on Australian families. But the word I do have some problems with is the word `cynical' because the majority of the difficulties people trying to access welfare benefits are having were caused by policies voted in with the support of the Liberal and National parties in opposition in this chamber. The Opposition has supported what the Government has been doing-eating away, cutting away, at the so-called social security support services or the welfare net.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my relatively short time in this chamber, I have seen the Opposition support the Government on a range of measures that have contributed to the problems that are part of these tragic human consequences of the recession. I refer to problems such as reducing the income support for young unemployed and homeless people to well below the poverty line; refusing to support exemption of family farms from the family allowance supplement-an issue which Senator Alston covered very well. Not only are farm incomes down but also there are no jobs in rural areas which these families can fall back on. At the same time as acknowledging the difficulties, farm families are still cut off from the family allowance supplement which the Government has highlighted as one of its achievements. I would certainly agree with that-it has been very successful in the case of city families on low incomes. Unfortunately, farming families and families of small business men and women are not able to access that support service.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have also seen the introduction of a liquid assets test on unemployment and sickness benefits; reductions in rent allowance; the introduction of a $2.50 prescription charge for pensioners; and so on. Indeed, in the life of this Labor Government, the list goes on and on, and grows alarmingly. The Opposition has continually aided and abetted the Government in its practices in implementing these policies. That is why I have great difficulty with the word `cynical' in the Opposition's matter of public importance.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures have served to exacerbate the problems faced by those people who find themselves retrenched or unemployed through no fault of their own and who are unable to secure any job-an inferior job, a job well below their level of expertise; indeed, any job at all. These measures have helped further entrench many Australian families in poverty. Senator Alston pointed out again-and we talked about this last week in this place-the growing lists of people trying to access the support services offered by welfare agencies only to be turned away in more and more cases. So I think a fair bit of cynicism is coming from both sides, rather than just the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst I understand the Opposition being a bit miffed about having its policies stolen from under its nose and wanting to jump on the band wagon and be full of concern about the consequences of the recession, just what is it specifically offering? What is it offering long-suffering Australian families at this time? What would it be doing in this situation? Where is the benefit to low income and rural Australian families in policies that call for total deregulation and privatisation of our transport, health, financial and communication systems? Where is the benefit in the unemployment benefit being cut off after nine months? Where is the benefit in an across the board, flat rate consumption tax? Where is the benefit for them in massive cuts in public expenditure?
       </para>
       <para>
        To those families and people now experiencing hardship, it all sounds like more of the same-the rhetoric of the trickle down economic theory and a major shortage of new ideas from either the Government or the Opposition. The country is not in good shape-and this is something else that we seem to be in agreement about today. We all know that Australian families are certainly feeling the pinch.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not spend time going over the statistics-which Senator Alston did so ably-looking at the unemployment rates. However 9.1 per cent is only the official unemployment rate. It does not take into account hidden unemployment, particularly women. It does not look at those who are now underemployed and forced to work perhaps a four-day week. In fact, officially, some 760,000 people are now unemployed; and I consider that to be very conservative. We now have statistics which show that, on average, 18 people are trying to fill each job vacancy. There is certainly a far larger number of people looking for the jobs in the low skilled or unskilled areas. There were some 3,000 bankruptcies Australia-wide in December and, as has been stated, farm incomes are dramatically lower-in fact, they are estimated to be about 67 per cent lower this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        What these families suffering these difficulties now need to hear is fresh ideas from the Government. There needs to be some acknowledgment that its way may not be the only path through these difficult economic times. The difficult times that are facing them have been made more difficult by the fact that the Government is refusing to acknowledge that they are having major problems. The Government needs to show some concern and give some practical support now. Instead, we have a situation where any alternative point of view or criticism of the Government, from within its ranks or from the community, is often taken as naive and treacherous and, as a result, we simply do not get to hear from those who actually disagree with the prevailing economic line. For example, we hardly ever hear the view-contrary to mythology-that Australia spends less on housing and social security payments than most other developed countries. Also, we are not as heavily taxed as most comparable nations. The problem with our taxation system is: who pays?
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to speak briefly again about Australia's income support system because it seems to me that this is where the Government's disregard for human consequences of the recession is most apparent. As I have said many times before, we are seeing a move away from the social security system which was designed to be a safety net; by the way, it did have the bipartisan support of the Opposition when in government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our social security system used to be driven by the attitude that we helped those who, through no fault of their own, were in financial need. What has occurred is that, through the notion of targeting, we have moved away from that basic concept-that is, that the social security system would apply universally to those Australians who lacked sufficient funds to maintain themselves and their families-and we are now dangerously close to talking about the `deserving poor', an attitude one would have hoped would have gone out with the poorhouse.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not say, as Senator Alston likes to make out, that the social security system should be available willy-nilly, as much as one likes, to anyone who happens to pass by. There obviously must be eligibility requirements. We object to the increasing whittling down of those requirements to the point where the system can no longer be said to be supporting those Australians who do not have sufficient funds to support themselves and their families. Every time a piece of social security legislation comes before this Parliament, it contains further constraints placed on eligibility criteria. What this means in practice is what Senator Alston was talking about previously: longer and longer waiting lists and longer and longer waiting periods before even getting to see somebody; a high level of literacy needed to complete the increasingly complex forms; a remarkable set of double standards put in place for women who want to receive sole parent pensions; a continuing invasion of privacy for social security recipients; and many recipients now needing personal advocates to find their way through the maze and over the hurdles that have been placed in front of them. For example, I draw the Senate's attention to what happens to young people trying to access the young homeless allowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        What it also means is that we have accepted as a community that it is okay to tighten the eligibility criteria on one group in the country, but not on others. For example, Professor Don Edgar from the Australian Institute of Family Studies pointed out that there are three main ways in which the state provides welfare. They are: public welfare or the social security and welfare programs; fiscal welfare-that is, tax relief, concessions and allowances; and occupational welfare-that is, benefits received by employees as a result of their employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has been happening in Australia is that the eligibility criteria for public welfare has become tighter and tighter, while the other two have, in fact, eased, thereby increasing benefits to the better off members of the community. And this is where targeting is taking us-not forward to a more equitable social security system, but backwards to Victorian notions of the deserving and the undeserving poor.
       </para>
       <para>
        People are either in poverty and unable to support themselves and their families and in need of financial assistance, or they are not. It does not matter how they got there or whether some of us might think some people are more deserving of support than others. We need an income support system that does just that-provides support to those who need it-instead of one that is unravelling at such a rapid rate that people in need of financial assistance are not getting it and have to resort to the welfare agencies, thus putting greater and greater pressure on the agencies' very limited resources. I call again on the Government to take note of what is happening. I ask: what is the Government planning to do for those people who are not able to access social security support and who cannot get support from the agencies? Where do they turn next?
       </para>
       <para>
        These agencies tell us that three ongoing problems are responsible for the increase in the numbers of people calling on them for assistance: firstly, tighter eligibility criteria; secondly, the longer waiting periods that now exist before people can access benefits at all, and this is particularly crucial for young people who are leaving school; and, thirdly, inadequate income support-that is, even if people eventually get onto the benefits, and again I highlight the situation of young people. The amounts they are asked to live on are so far below the poverty line that they are forced to turn to the agencies for additional support.
       </para>
       <para>
        When people receive support through the social security system, there are still numerous structural problems which the Government-and I must add here I suspect also the Opposition-refuses to address . For example, we continue to impose poverty traps and extremely high marginal tax rates on many social security recipients. Even in these harsh economic times, we hear scarcely a murmur of dissent or concern about these problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the slash and burn mentality of the Government's social security policies, it cannot target every unemployed person out of eligibility for benefits. Increases in unemployment are a direct consequence of the recession and, therefore, increased support and financial assistance will be required. I am pleased to note that additional funds will be going into training programs, but after these people have been trained, where are they going to go unless the jobs are available?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government must accept responsibility for the increasing numbers of people needing income support and it must ensure that these people get the support and assistance they need. If it cannot get its economic policies right and ensure full employment, then it must at least show some understanding and compassion for those who are suffering as a consequence of its failed policies. Unfortunately in the short term we will need more money to support those who are in need now.

        The Government's cynical disregard of the tragic human consequences of the recession, `We had to have.'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask: how many honourable senators present remember the J-curve? That was one of Paul Keating's earlier explanations for why we should not worry about the economic downturn that we then all realised we were in. The simple notion was to say that we might be on the downturn, but nonetheless this was part of the process of coming up again. An analogy was drawn to this J-curve that we were simply in an inevitable part of the picking up process. For those who have forgotten the J-curve, they might remember the economy bubbling over like champagne spilling out of an overfilled champagne glass. One imagines that the Treasurer (Mr Keating), with his French clocks, is quite familiar with overfilling his champagne glass to the extent that it bubbles over. I do not happen to have the league of friends who, when they have champagne, waste it by letting it bubble over the glass. That is the privilege of people with antique clock collections, I suppose.
       </para>
       <para>
        This was another way of saying, `Look, don't worry that the current account is not as we expect. Don't worry about all these imports coming in, the economy is bubbling over and things are going well', when we all knew that that simply was not the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The trouble with this situation was that the media absolutely loved the performance put on by the Treasurer; they absolutely applauded and encouraged Australia to do the same. It is no surprise that the Treasurer has run out of positive analogies to make; there are no more that he can trot out for this performance. No-one is amused any more, and the performance looks just as tired as we have known for some time that it really is.
       </para>
       <para>
        Right now we are in the middle of the recession we needed to have. For those who do not remember, that is the recession that we were told just a few weeks before we did not need to have and we were not going to have. Those of us on this side of the chamber who said, `This nation is going into a negative growth phase, we are heading towards a recession', were labelled as the doomsday people who had nothing positive to say, who were trying to talk the economy down, when in fact we were trying to alert the Government to the fact that it was not in control, Paul Keating was not pulling the right levers, and a recession was on the way with all the tragic human consequences that we can now see.
       </para>
       <para>
        Women, of course, are the first people to sense the imminence of a recession. I do not say that because of any outdated notions that women have any sort of intuition that men do not; I do not actually believe that. I say that because they have a presence in a far broader spectrum of the daily marketplace of our lives than most men do simply because most men are the primary breadwinners and they spend much more time and confine themselves to a narrower spectrum of life than women are obliged to cope with and, by and large, enjoy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Women have been telling me and other parliamentarians what they have been able to sense by their engagement in this broad spectrum of life-what the kids need for school, what the prices are at the supermarket, whether their kids are having difficulty getting jobs-and they interchange this, if they are lucky enough to have some time to play tennis with their mates, and build up a collective knowledge which, quite frankly, is not accessible by bureaucrats locked away in Canberra. It is something someone can feel about a society, not something that someone can necessarily tell from statistics.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyway, here we are in this recession. It has apparently already been pointed out, but let me recap briefly how bad the situation is. The January 1991 seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for all persons is 8.4 per cent. That is the highest since March 1987. It is a dreadful situation. For young Australians, that is, the 15- to 19-year-olds, it is a desperate situation. The seasonally adjusted rate for January this year for young Australians who are looking for work and who cannot get a job is 21.7 per cent. As I say, it is absolutely disastrous.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation of women perhaps deserves particular attention. I would like to turn to that now, not because women have a more important place in the discussion of the recession but because the Government likes to blow its own bags about what it has done about creating jobs. I do not notice too much attention being given to the jobs the Government has not created or the jobs that have been lost as a consequence of Government activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, for January 1991, if the unemployment figures are split into males and females, the figure for females is actually higher. It was 8.5 per cent and the highest level since November 1987. Looking at the unemployed in terms of numbers, for females the figure is 300,100. That is the highest level ever of unemployed females. I admit that is partly because more women want to work in the first place, but it is not only that. That is not why that level is now the highest ever. It is at the highest level because we are in a recession and people cannot get the jobs they want. The January 1991 figure for unemployed females looking for part time work is 106,800; again the highest level ever. There has been a dramatic increase since December last year, with a further 17,700 women looking for part time work.
       </para>
       <para>
        I listened to what Senator McMullan said and I do not think I heard him refer to numbers of people. I heard him refer to technical policies and what the Government was going to do about this and that in a very impartial and third party sense. The only aspect he raised which gave some insight into the fact that he might perhaps understand what it is like to be unemployed came when he quoted someone as having said, `It does not matter if you have only one per cent unemployment; if you are the one unemployed, you are 100 per cent unemployed'. He did not go on to say how many people fit into that category. There are 300,100 women who, as far as they are concerned, are 100 per cent unemployed. He did not mention that there were 418,500 men who are 100 per cent unemployed, as far as they are concerned. There are 106,800 women looking for part time work and 193,300 looking for full time work. Each of those people, in his or her own way, feels 100 per cent hard done by because of the policies of this Government. Every one of them is quite entitled to feel like that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased that Senator Lees commenced on a positive note by saying that the answer to this situation is jobs. That is what we need for people who are unemployed. The way to alleviate the tragic consequences of this recession is to create a situation where people have jobs. However, she went on to say that the coalition deserves some sort of criticism for assisting the Government in better targeting welfare programs. She somehow sought to create the impression that better targeting programs was a bad thing, and that if one wanted to target welfare better, one was somehow out to get all welfare recipients, which is simply not the case. If there were an unlimited-or an almost unlimited-pool of money, one is nonetheless doing the right thing by those who are to receive that money if one makes sure the money is most appropriately targeted.

        We could have a debate about that. Had I left home at 15, 16 or 17 years of age, I do not think there would have been the slightest question that I could get the unemployment benefit because the social attitude then was that one did not leave home when one was 15. I am grateful that honourable senators have not made any unkind remarks about how long ago that was. However, things have changed in that time. I know that and young people expect to get away earlier or, if you like, cut the umbilical cord, the apron strings or whatever.

         —As Senator Lees said, there is another cycle coming on. All I mean by raising that matter is that the cycles do change, and what was an appropriate welfare payment for one generation may not be appropriate for another. I do not think it does the debate on welfare, which hopefully will continue to improve and become more informed, any good to say simply that if one wants to question the validity of continuing with a particular aspect of a welfare policy, one is therefore anti-welfare. I do not think that is an appropriate remark to make at all.

        If one has in one's own mind a vision that welfare can be better targeted to people who are more needy, I do not think it is appropriate to say, `Well, you are just raising the concept of the undeserving poor'. I think that is a huge quantum leap and not one that I felt was explained in the speech made by Senator Lees. Senator Lees said that it was a question not of whether one is undeserving or deserving but of whether one is in need or not. I take issue with that. That is not a philosophy I endorse. I do not think that, if one is in need because one is not looking for work, it is fair to expect other taxpayers to foot the bill for one's indulgence. I do not say this to indicate at all that I believe there is a huge number of people in that category or that there is some unbelievably large proportion of these people on the unemployment benefit.

        I do not think the guy who is on the assembly line at Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd thinks it is fair either. He has to work to support his family and children and he does not think that other people should have the choice about that, and neither do I. I do not think that is having a go at welfare recipients at all. Quite the contrary. I think it is maintaining the integrity of welfare recipients. If a guy is laid off from his job because of circumstances-because the company was mismanaged, because of the economy, or because the company failed because of the ineptitude of the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-and he has genuinely lost his job through no fault of his own, it is an unmitigated disgrace to ask him to line up with people who cannot be bothered to look for a job, because he deserves every penny and the others do not. We could debate another day the circumstances under which and how we define and ascertain whether someone is genuinely looking for a job. That is a difficult area, and I understand that. However, I do not think we should be deterred from pursuing that task simply because it is a difficult area. It is a task we should definitely continue to pursue.

       <para>
        Senator Lees said there is cynicism on both sides but she did not point out that the cynicism on her side is such that the Australian Democrats produced a whole whack of policies at the last election but could not cost them. Here is the party that picks up the bits and pieces of policy left by the major parties, according to them-the nooks and crannies they shove their beaks into-and parcels off what policies they can to people, telling the major parties here they are cynical. I would have thought that was the pot calling the kettle black.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that the whole focus of this debate should be on the fact that, unless there is structural change in this country, jobs will not be created. What the Government and the Democrats do not understand is that one does not create jobs by giving money away. One creates jobs by structural reform. This is what we are on about. Senator Lees says she does not know what we are offering. That is what we are offering-reform of the labour market, reform of the waterfront and reform of the taxation system. I could go on had I more time, but I clearly do not. That is the way to give people jobs-not just give them money and say, `We're sorry for the mess we created'. The way to give people jobs is to fix up the mess and that is what the coalition will do when it gets into government after the next election.

         —Tonight we are debating the following matter of public importance proposed by Senator Alston:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government's cynical disregard of the tragic human consequences of the recession, `We had to have.'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite interesting that this matter of public importance is proposed on the day of the release of the Government's industry statement where the Government outlines in a positive way a blueprint for the economic future of Australia. All we hear from the Opposition, in the most carping and negative terms, is this so-called matter of public importance. It is so typical of the intellectual bankruptcy of the Opposition-nothing more than a tirade of criticisms and absolutely no solutions whatsoever offered for Australia's economic circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has proposed, and is working in a comprehensive and integrated way, both to cure the problems of the Australian economy and to mitigate their consequences. It is a government, of course, of ideas and ideals, as opposed to nothing from the Opposition. This Opposition has no plans for the economy except for a few tired, outdated and discredited New Right proposals that are religiously expounded by the gurus of the New Right that now litter the Liberal Party both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. At the same time as putting forward this discredited New Right agenda, the Liberal Party plans to do nothing more than kick sand in the faces of those people who most need help in these difficult economic times. So I ask you, Mr Deputy President: who is really showing cynicism at this time?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Alston talks about tragic human consequences. I think it is worth examining how the Opposition would plan to treat the unemployed, the aged, those people who need assistance in our community, the disadvantaged. What is the Liberal Party proposing at this time? Laurie Oakes said it all in an article in the Bulletin magazine when Dr Hewson described his mind-boggling plans for the social security area. In an article headed `Efficiency out, ideology in', he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one should be under any illusions about the hard line the coalition is taking on the question of social welfare under John Hewson's leadership. The ideas being tossed up by Hewson and Alston,-
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Hewson and Senator Alston, I interpolate-
       </para>
       <para>
        including the possibility that the federal Department of Social Security could be abolished altogether, give the first real indication of how a coalition government would set about trying to achieve that $3 billion cut in federal spending that the Opposition's economic `dries' have been talking about for several years now. The plan is to slash the welfare budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, I must give Senator Alston credit because he has had a very significant role in coming forward with this Liberal Party policy. In this same Bulletin article he is quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        I think things such as review teams and rehabilitation exercises could all be done by the private sector much more efficiently.
       </para>
       <para>
        What did Laurie Oakes, who, of course, is no noted Labor supporter, say about all this? He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Picture this. A woman pensioner answers a knock on the door and is confronted by a man from Wormauld or Mayne Nickless demanding to know whether she is living with anyone and, if so, who. What is his authority? His company has a government contract to check on the bona fides of welfare recipients. Most Australians, I suggest, would regard that scenario as unacceptable, but it is what the Federal Opposition is seriously putting forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        That, of course, is Senator Alston's view of an ideal Australian society. I think it was the Treasurer (Mr Keating) who correctly said that Senator Alston would have age pensioners lining up in the marbled foyers of the major accountancy firms.

         —That is right: the Treasurer. It is interesting that Dr Hewson and Senator Alston have now gone quiet about some of their plans, but I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, that they are very serious. I know that they do not want the electors in Australia to get a grip on what they are proposing, but I think it is worth while reminding the Senate tonight in this matter of public importance of precisely what Senator Alston is putting forward.
        </para>

       <para>
        This is his program: the abolition of the Commonwealth Department of Social Security, with many of the responsibilities of the Department of Social Security passing to the States; decisions about eligibility for benefits to be made by welfare agencies such as the Smith Family or St Vincent de Paul Society, presumably by voluntary workers; more money to be given to charities to distribute as hand-outs in place, at least partially, of current welfare payments; the actual payment of benefits to be made by firms of accountants; and eligibility reviews to be conducted by private firms with a government contract to check bona fides. In other words, those firms would have the power to investigate social security recipients' private lives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the welfare functions having been handed over to State governments, people in some States would then possibly receive higher welfare payments than people in other States. The coup de grace is the abolition of not only the Commonwealth Department of Social Security but also the health and education departments. That is the Opposition's agenda, to the extent that it has one. As I have said, the Opposition has gone a bit quiet on it now. But there is no doubt that fundamentally the Opposition is committed to destroying a targeted and equitable social welfare system such as the one we have in Australia-which, I might say, is the envy of other countries-and would put in its place the sort of appalling system of social security that we see in the United States.

        I was very interested in an article in the Age on 24 October, 1990, entitled `US study challenges Libs' welfare plan', which stated:

        The ``safety net'' of welfare payments has many holes in it, through which a large number of Americans fall. It is common to see people sleeping on the footpath and in parks in big cities; it is impossible to walk through central Washington or New York without being asked to hand over your spare change to a homeless person.
       </para>
       <para>
        The social divisions-between rich and poor, between black and white-are often sharply defined. Income levels and, even more noticeably, benefit levels vary widely between states.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the sort of system that Senator Alston is proposing for this country. He wants to tear up the welfare safety net which existed even under conservative governments in Australia, although it has been greatly improved by Labor governments. In the meantime, Senator Alston diverts himself by repeatedly attacking the Department of Social Security as to the way it is administered. He tries to claim that the Department has no need to train its staff. He resents the fact that the Department of Social Security is such an efficient deliverer of services that it spends only 3.5c in the dollar in delivering its services-a record that private enterprise would kill for.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the debate on this matter of public importance it is valid to draw out some of these basic philosophical differences which so obviously exist between the Opposition and the Government. This Government does not want the sort of divided and angry country that Margaret Thatcher bequeathed to England. This Government and the Australian Labor Party want a reasonable and compassionate society which takes care of those people who, for whatever reason or for that matter for whatever length of time, are not in a position to provide for themselves financially.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the one hand, our policies aim to provide such a society through the good times and through a recession such as we are enduring now. On the other hand, the Opposition seems to aspire towards a social welfare system such as that in the United States where social welfare recipients have to go cap in hand to receive benefits and then humiliate themselves in the community by paying for goods with food stamps, and where in some States, left to set their own levels of benefits, unsustainable levels of support are offered deliberately so that poor people will not settle there. Dr Hewson and Senator Alston do not look at a system such as this and shudder as any reasonable person would; they look at that system and say, `Yes, that system is for us'. Yet they are the people who, in a matter of public importance such as this, talk about a cynical disregard for the tragic human consequences of the recession.

Indeed, there does need to be a focus on the tragic human consequences of the recession but, as pointed out by previous speakers on both sides earlier this evening, there certainly needs to be a focusing on the solutions to our current economic crisis. Let us not pretend that it is not worthwhile focusing, as I said, on these tragic human consequences in a balanced way. It is important that politicians who are ensconced in this Parliament House in Canberra for weeks at a time have a feel for what is happening on the streets, under the bridges, on the park benches and in the homes, and a feel for the consequences of their economic actions.

        It is important that people understand that the Treasurer, Mr Keating-who claims so much credit for the way the Australian economy was managed over the past few years, when he reassured us that he had his hands firmly on the lever and was in control, that we would not have a recession, that we would have a soft landing-and the Ministers in this place have a clear understanding of the consequences of their actions. The word `cynical' that my colleague Senator Alston put into the terms of the matter of public importance is important. It has obviously hurt the Government senators who have spoken in this debate, but the word `cynical' does describe some of the attitudes of some of the Ministers in this Government.

        Senator Button, in response to a question yesterday as to whether the unemployment rate would hit 10 per cent, said that he was not sure, that it was just a pedantic matter and was not really a problem. I think that getting too carried away with unemployment statistics is quite boring and quite pedantic. However, for each body in the community who makes up a fraction of a percentage of an unemployment rate, it is very important. As Senator McMullan said earlier, if one is the only person in Australia who is unemployed, one is 100 per cent unemployed. In the northern suburbs of Perth, the latest figures I have show that youth unemployment-one of the most devastating forms of unemployment-has hit well over 35 per cent.

         —Senator Calvert tells me that it is up to 39 per cent in Hobart. Those figures are fairly stark. Because new people, untrained people, are looking to join the work force, youth unemployment is higher than the average rate of unemployment. But there has been more than a doubling of the rate of youth unemployment in the northern suburbs of Perth in my electorate of Western Australia. For example, in the electorates of Stirling and Moore about 3,500 additional people have become unemployed in the past 12 months. That is, 3,500 young Australians, many of whom have been at school for 10 or 12 years, who are looking forward to joining the work force and taking their place in Australia, to growing up and finding their own way through life, upon deciding to leave school at somewhere between the ages of 15 and 19 years just cannot find a job.

The second half of this year, I inform honourable senators opposite, is not very far away. The leaves on the trees in Canberra are beginning to turn brown; winter is upon us. The second half of the year is very close. If we have just experienced what the Treasurer assured us only a few months ago would be a soft landing, I put it to him that we have only just entered into this recession technically and that technically it will take a lot longer than the second half of this year to get out of it. A lot of the problems that have caused this recession will not be solved before the end of this year.

        I came to Canberra this week expecting that the much revered 12 March statement would offer some hope. I am sure that there are thousands of young people out there who listened to the delivery of this statement by the Prime Minister, and by Senator Evans in this place, who were looking for a ray of hope. If we looked at the sort of news coverage this statement received during the suspension of the sitting for dinner, we would see that the reaction has been very mixed. If we analyse the statement, I suppose it makes one think about Senator Faulkner's description of his Government as a government of ideas and ideals.

         —As Senator Calvert says, this statement is a dog's breakfast. Let us try to bring some balance back into the argument. There are a number of things in the statements which we have to applaud. Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, in his press release which was released only a couple of hours ago, praised the tariff cuts, which obviously form a central part of the Opposition's economic policies. We have praised the lowering of tax on business inputs, even though we clearly do not believe it goes far enough. We have praised the accelerated depreciation which will help business of all sizes. We have also praised the directions of the decisions in relation to the anti-dumping provisions.

        Without having seen the resource security legislation, we believe that in the resource security legislation debate we have seen the pendulum clearly swing from a green anti-development stance that this Government seemed to find practical prior to 24 March last year, towards a more rational balance between development and environment, which the Opposition has supported for a long time.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are things that Dr Hewson has supported, and I obviously share his support for them. However, we must understand that Australia is in a very tough economic position. Our economy is not just suffering from a cold; it is suffering from a recession which has been created by a number of factors. Many of the deep structural factors require far reaching micro-economic reform. In the past few weeks we have heard the cliche about trying to find some gain from the pain that we are experiencing through this recession. In this respect, we do need those structural reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why the statement which was made today just does not help. Bandaids are being applied to some fairly deep scars but those bandaids are not going to help the problem. Dr Hewson and the Opposition have identified something like $16 billion worth of development projects which are held up because of all sorts of environmental delays at the moment. We hope that this resource security legislation and the new emphasis the Government is placing on development may speed up those approvals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The package delivered this afternoon creates at best about a one-tenth move towards the sort of increase in export performance that Australia needs-an increase that the Opposition and the Business Council of Australia (BCA) have identified as being able to be achieved in a single year from the broad range restructuring that the Opposition's policies propound. We believe we can have a $43 billion turnaround.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to restate what Australia must achieve as a nation if we are to overcome the economic crisis. Part of that economic crisis, of course, is the foreign debt problem. Even to stabilise that level of debt, Australia needs to achieve a 4 per cent per annum net export turnaround. Clearly, to do that we need to make some structural adjustments, which are not included in the statement we have seen today.

        I put it to the Senate that those thousands and thousands of young unemployed people out there can take some heart from the statement but clearly we cannot embrace it as the sort of action that we all know-at least those of us on this side of the Senate-is required to solve Australia's long term problems. Indeed, many of those young people are going to have to wait until 1993, when the next Federal election is held, to have any hope whatsoever.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have spoken about the young unemployed. I guess that it is quite often politically astute to focus on those people. But it is also sensible to focus on some of the other people who are feeling the deep human tragedy caused by this recession that we had to have. I refer to a much maligned group of people called WA Entrepreneurs who, apart from having taken a hammering in the press since 1987, do have a number of redeeming features. Western Australia is one of the leading States in the whole of the world as far as mining production and agricultural production are concerned. We have led the world in other areas such as property development, construction and civil engineering. I am reminded that we lead the world in many areas of financial services, with Australia-wide groups such as the Armstrong Jones Property Trust and Growth Equities Mutual Property Trusts having actually been formed in Perth and become some of the leading financial institutions in this nation in the last few years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The entrepreneurs I talk about-many of whom have run into severe problems during the last year-are a very important part of this nation. It is often not politically popular to stick up for these people. I think it is important to understand, and important particularly for young unemployed people to understand, that these are the people who go out and borrow money and risk capital and their own livelihoods to develop something-be it a mine, a building, a shopping centre, some new civil engineering work or new financial service.

         —That is right. These are the people who go out and take the risks. These people have been hurt very badly by this recession, by high interest rates, by some industrial action and by some of the structural problems in the economy. One of my former colleagues and clients in Perth, Western Australia, was a fellow who developed a woollen mill, a shopping centre and an office building. He has just been wound up. He was someone who borrowed a lot of money and put a lot of his own equity into these projects. But he had to be wound up last month basically because of the high interest rates which were eating away at his projects, because of the industrial disputes on his building sites and clearly because of the effect of wool prices on his woollen mill. Basically every factor that drove that person to the wall was totally outside of his control and they were all the structural problems. The price of wool, interest rates and the industrial disputation on his sites were all outside his control.

        That fellow will not come back in five years' time after he has sorted out his current problems. He will, I guess, sit back and not take any risks for the rest of his life.

        Senator McMullan talked about the skills base. He talked about the training schemes that Australia needs during this recession. I suggest that one of the consequences and one of the deep human tragedies of this recession is that many of these white collar people-the entrepreneurs, the professionals, the executives-will be destroyed, have already been destroyed or are going through the process of being destroyed. They have either had receivers appointed or banks are winding them up. They are all going through this pain at the moment, and it is very much a human pain.

        These people are the entrepreneurs. These are the people who actually travel to South East Asia to build the links that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, (Senator Button) refers to. These are the actual people. They are not the Austrade officials, they are not the bureaucrats; they are the actual people who go up there and build these links that Australia so needs. I close, Madam Acting Deputy President, by saying that there are many deep human tragedies caused by this recession which will have long and meaningful consequences for the Australian economy.

All Senator Faulkner could do was to quote his friend and comrade Laurie Oakes. In fact, we need to be aware that Laurie Oakes is trying desperately to boost the flagging popularity of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) again. Of course, the problem really surrounds the Government trying to do the same thing. The media generally have built up an expectation in Australia that we will have a presidential-style election campaign year after year and the Government is now faced with the situation that it has to get the Prime Minister off the hook because it knows that simply on a one to one basis it cannot defeat Dr Hewson.

         —Well, actually that is a very good point. Yes, I withdraw what I said. I should have said that Senator Faulkner read the whole article in the absence of writing a speech. I pick up my contradiction there by the honourable senator's interjection and I thank him for that. It was a shame; if the honourable senator had concentrated a bit more on the problems that Australia is encountering at the moment, we might have had a decent debate out of this. I do not wish just to quote articles other than to remind Senator Faulkner, who is obviously an avid Bulletin reader when it suits his purposes, that he obviously did not read last week's edition which I will come back to in a moment.

       <para>
        Senator Faulkner was attempting to be critical of our policies which aim to give people jobs, a future, security and hope. It is a shame that he has been critical of all of those things, particularly given the fact that some industry statement has been put down in both chambers today that does not go anywhere near trying to solve the problems that this country is faced with.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Faulkner also attacked my colleague Senator Alston for proposing policies in the social security area that will give the disadvantaged, the poor, the homeless, the unemployed and the generally less well-off a chance for a future. Once again, I find it a great shame that he chose to attack Senator Alston on such basic fundamentals that this Government has seen fit to just jettison for the sake of expediency. Of course, the Government which Senator Faulkner represents offers no jobs, no security, rising unemployment and unprecedented rates of business bankruptcies-and it pretends that none of it exists.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyone who listened to the contribution of Senator Faulkner tonight would have been led to believe that we were in cloud-cuckoo-land, that everything was perfect and that the garden was absolutely rosy. I wish that Senator Faulkner and his colleagues would have the courage to go out and tell those people who are suffering the tragic human consequences of the recession that everything is well, that they will be looked after, that they will have a job soon and that the employer that they are currently working for will not go out of business. He knows that the Government cannot do it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, I remind him of the Bulletin article which he chose not to quote, of course, because this article gives the Government a message-or it should do anyway. Of course, Senator Faulkner and his colleagues do not want to hear that message. Page 20 of the Bulletin of 12 March 1991 states:

        Following the latest rash of bad economic news, the Hawke government's popularity has again slipped, according to the latest Morgan Gallup Poll, in late February. The poll-conducted after the announcement of the South Australian State Bank's problems and the release of high inflation, high unemployment and poor retail sales figures-showed that had an election been held at that time, the Hawke government would have been easily defeated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Faulkner is saying that everything is fine, so let us not worry about it. In the same edition of the Bulletin we have only to go over two pages to an article written by the Government's friend and comrade Laurie Oakes which is headed `Labor's out-of-tune quartet'. South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and my own State of Western Australia are going down the mine shaft with a tail wind. But does that worry this Government? No, of course it does not. Big brother, the Federal Government, is taking their hands and defending them.

        Over many months, we have seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) defending the former Premier of Western Australia, even though there has been evidence to suggest that the former Premier has not acted properly and is not a fit and proper person to hold the position of Ambassador to Ireland. Yet the Minister for Foreign Affairs decided to condone that type of action by his belligerence in not answering questions. Of course, successors of Mr Burke-both Mr Dowding and Dr Lawrence-have seen fit to carry on the trend that Mr Burke started. Of course, as my colleague and friend Senator Campbell has just said--

         —Senator Faulkner obviously mentioned the Government of ideas and ideals, referred to by Senator Campbell. Senator Campbell said that the Government of deals is more to the point. One has to look at the State governments.

        All one needs to do is to look at all the indicators by which this Government can be judged: unemployment is up; exports are down; more businesses are going broke; economic growth is down; retail sales are going down; job vacancies are going down; labour force participation is down; average weekly earnings, in real terms, are down; and taxes are up. That is the record by which this Government wants to be judged and it is the record by which it wants the Australian people to say that they are happy and that everything is magic. Everything is not magic, and the sooner this Government realises that the better off all Australians will be.

        Today's industry statement not only did not contain answers; it gave no hope. The criteria by which this Government should be judged and which I just mentioned really cause people right across this country an enormous amount of suffering. It may be easy for Government senators to sit in here, in their cosy jobs, and not be concerned about the level of unemployment and not be concerned about the young people in this country who will never have a job the way this Government is going.

Yet has that been discussed tonight by the Government? Have the unemployment increases, the business bankruptcies, the retail sales decline-any of those subjects-been discussed tonight?

        In many respects, I found the industry statement this afternoon a joke but, nonetheless, it was a major statement that was brought in by the Government. Yet in the Senate we had the Minister responsible not even prepared to read the Prime Minister's statement on the Minister's portfolio. I can understand his being a bit churlish, hurt and indeed a bit embarrassed about it, but the people of Australia are being treated with disregard, and so is this Parliament. We had a charade this afternoon with Senator Evans mumbling words that mean nothing to all those people who are suffering so tragically under the effects of this Government and, one must remind the Senate, from the effects of four State Labor governments. Also, one must not forget that there is possibly a fifth Labor State Government yet to be added to the list.

        To think that this Government has also tried to pretend that the problems of the State Bank of South Australia were unforeseen. To think that the Labor Government in Victoria tried to say that the problems with the Pyramid Building Society and the State Bank in that State were unforeseen. Yet we get the Ambassador to Ireland saying that he was the crystal ball gazer with Rothwells and sought to bail them out at taxpayers' expense. There is one big difference between the problems in South Australia and Victoria compared with those in Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bailouts in the other States were done well after the event, when all the facts were known. In Western Australia it was a knee-jerk reaction to help their mates. The other fundamental difference is that, in comparable terms, there were very few little old grandmothers who invested $20 or $30 in Rothwells. In South Australia and Victoria there were many such people. But once again the question needs to be asked: does this Government care? Sadly, the answer is no, based not only on what has been going on over the past 12 months, but on what has transpired in this debate in this Parliament on this very day. There has been no constructive contribution from the Government, nor any shade of hope whatever that it will turn around the problems that this country faces to make sure people will not suffer any longer.

I believe that I have been misrepresented and ask for a withdrawal.

       The document read as follows-
      </para>
      <para>
       The report I have just tabled deals with the redevelopment of Borneo Barracks at Cabarlah in Queensland. The limit-of-cost estimate for the work is $12.71 million (at August 1990 prices).
      </para>
      <para>
       The works referred to the Committee combine into a single project the construction of additional facilities for the Joint Telecommunications School and support facilities to enable 7 Signal Regiment to provide the necessary support for the School.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Joint Telecommunications School provides specialist signal training for the Australian Defence Force. It cannot train the required numbers in the facilities it currently shares with 7 Signal Regiment.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1985, the ADF examined specialist signal training common to two or more Services with a view to conducting joint training by one Service, and to recommend the most appropriate location for a training school. As a result of this study, Cabarlah was selected and the Joint Training School was raised there on 1 September 1986. Navy and Air Force relocated their schools to Cabarlah, leading to a significant increase in the staff and student population. The 1985 study was reassessed in 1990 and Cabarlah was confirmed as the most suitable location for the School.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most of the existing facilities at Cabarlah were constructed in the 1960s, when there were 212 personnel posted there; some facilities remain from the 1940s. The current establishment is 420 Service personnel (including 160 trainees) and 15 civilian staff. By 1995, there are expected to be 718 Service personnel, including 230 trainees at any one time, and 25 civilian staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       The objective of the proposal is to provide sufficient working and living accommodation so the School can train sufficient specialist personnel for the Defence Force by building:
      </para>
      <para>
       * permanent, purpose-designed training facilities

      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       * rank and file dining and recreational facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee was concerned about the quality of the water supplied to Cabarlah and took evidence from the Crow's Nest Shire Council that it was examining the possibility of providing an adequate filtration system. We have recommended that Defence and Australian Construction Services continue their discussions with the Shire council to provide better quality water to Borneo Barracks.
      </para>
      <para>
       The land surrounding Borneo Barracks is zoned ``Rural A'' and most of the blocks in the one kilometre buffer zone around the base are about four hectares in area. Rezoning to ``Rural B'' would allow two hectare blocks and there could be consequential effects on operations at the base. While Crow's Nest Shire Council does not anticipate pressure for more intense subdivision before its current strategic plan expires in 2000AD, it is aware there is some development in an area close to the buffer zone.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both the council and Defence are aware of these potential problems from urban encroachment, and the Committee commends them for their sensible and cooperative attitudes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee would like to thank the personnel at Borneo Barracks for all the work which went into its inspection and public hearing on 19 December 1990.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending existing legislation administered within the primary industries and energy portfolio. The Bill contains minor administrative amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 and consequential amendments; the Dairy Produce Act 1986; the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986; and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985. The amendments to this Act provide for the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to be changed to the Meat Research Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to change the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to Meat Research Corporation was made at the request of the Corporation. The change was sought because its name was being confused with the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. In addition the length of the name itself was causing confusion, particularly in the media.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments to this Act also bring the Corporation into line with Government policy and the legislation for other rural research and development bodies by confining the Government's commitment to match industry funding for the Corporation to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequential amendments following from the change of the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation and the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 being changed to the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 are being made to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977; Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council Act 1984; Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984; Beef Production Levy Act 1990; Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Act 1990; Cattle Export Charge Act 1990; Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1990; Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989; Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977; Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964; Rural Industries Research Act 1985; and Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dairy Produce Act 1986 and Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986. This amendment is required to reflect the inclusion of equal employment opportunity provisions in the Dairy Produce Act 1986, which is the enabling act of the Australian Dairy Corporation. The amendment will bring the Australian Dairy Corporation into line with existing government policy on equal employment opportunity. The amendments to this Act also provide for the name of the Australian Dairy Industry Conference to be changed to the Australian Dairy Industry Council and for its executive council to be known as its executive. These name changes require consequential amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        Horticultural Research and Development Act 1987. The amendment provides for changes to the commercial role, administrative controls and accountability of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The changes are consistent with provisions contained in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 which provides the framework for portfolio research and development.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendments to the Corporation's functions and powers concern the commercialisation of research and development and powers to join in the formation of a company and to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property. Arrangements for the conduct of corporation meetings and the decision making processes are streamlined to permit meetings by electronic means and for decisions to be taken without face to face meetings. Minor modifications are made to the Corporation's research and development plan and program to assist the Corporation to use these documents as more effective budgetary and planning tools.
       </para>
       <para>
        The accountability of the Corporation is strengthened by a requirement that commercial activity in which the Corporation has an interest and activities relating to the formation of a company are included in the Corporation's annual report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes to the Horticultural Research and Development Act 1987 will increase the commercial flexibility of the Corporation and are consistent with the Government's policy of increased industry autonomy and coordination of research and development.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The chief purpose of this Bill is to provide a mechanism for the establishment within the Australian Horticultural Corporation of an Australian Dried Fruits Board.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill forms one component of the Government's response to the Industries Assistance Commission's report into the dried vine fruits industry of September 1989. The Government agrees with the Commission that there needs to be reform of the existing level of government assistance arrangements for the dried vine fruits industry. The other measures are contained in the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill which covers changes to dried vine fruits statutory equalization and sultana underwriting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill is also consistent with the Government's decisions in response to the Professor Jeremy Davis ``Review of Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities'' of March 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government announced on 18 October 1990 in response to the Davis Review that it would not proceed at this stage with the recommendation to reform the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and the Australian Honey Board into an Australian Agricultural Marketing Corporation. Rather than disrupt the relationship being developed between industry and the Australian Horticultural Corporation established in 1988, the Government announced the incorporation of the dried vine fruits industry into the Horticultural Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, the dried vine fruits industry will retain a high degree of independence over its export marketing operations within the Australian Horticultural Corporation. This arrangement reflects the industry's long history of competing successfully in export markets, a record of achievement which, unfortunately, has not always been matched by some of Australia's other horticultural industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The future participation of the dried vine fruits industry in the Australian Horticultural Corporation through an Australian dried fruits board is also in line with the Government's view that when monopoly export control powers are exercised, government needs to be assured sufficient checks and balances are in place to ensure that national interest is taken into account. The range of dried fruits export controls which are currently exercised by the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation will be continued by the Australian Dried Fruits Board but under the broad oversight of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Government's concerns in this area will then largely be met.
       </para>
       <para>
        The mechanism for the dried vine fruits industry joining the Australian Horticultural Corporation will be, as I have indicated above, the establishment of a product board which is provided by the Bill before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage, it is my expectation that only the dried vine fruits industry will operate within the Horticultural Corporation under these special provisions and that existing participants and newcomers will continue to participate directly in the Horticultural Corporation under the existing provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the specific provisions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill 1990. A product board established within the Australian Horticultural Corporation will be required as its major task, in the same way as is the Corporation, to assist, or in the case of dried vine fruit, to continue to assist, specific horticultural industries in export marketing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Product boards will replace the existing option of industry forming product group committees. These were intended to provide a formal mechanism for the provision of product-specific advice to the Corporation. This role is now being efficiently and cost effectively exercised through market liaison committees established by the participating industry organisations in consultation with the Corporation. Should industries wish to formalise these without going to the cost of a product board, the Corporation retains the power to set up committees under the general committees provision and to delegate powers to such bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Changes to the structure of the Australian Horticultural Corporation to provide for product boards are contained primarily in the early sections of part 2 of the Bill. The balance of part 2 sets out the form and areas of operation of product boards.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Horticultural Corporation's strategic planning process will need to take account of, and include reference to, products covered by product boards. The Corporation's annual report will include accounts of product board operations and separately audited product board financial statements.
       </para>
       <para>
        In many respects the structure and operations of product boards mirror those of the Horticultural Corporation. This can be seen, for example, in the relationship between the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Minister which is largely replicated in the relationship between the Corporation and a product board.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the dried vine fruits industry, the Australian Dried Fruits Board is set up under part 3 of this Bill. If there is a case in the future, any other product board will be established by regulations. These will set out the name of the board and the products to be covered by it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill makes special provision in the amendment to section 8 of the Horticultural Corporation Act to prevent both the Corporation and a board doing same things at the same time to the same products. This is achieved by providing that the Corporation will not undertake functions in relation to a board's products unless that board is in agreement. Obviously, corporation-wide activities may nonetheless be appropriate in such areas as advertising or market research programs and a product board will still have the opportunity to participate in these.
       </para>
       <para>
        A product board will be a body corporate. There are sound commercial reasons for providing a product board with corporate identity particularly in terms of financial and contractual activities that it might undertake but, as well, it clarifies for those who have contact with a board the authority under which it is operating. This will be particularly important for the Australian Dried Fruits Board which will take on long standing arrangements with a number of overseas agencies and groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        A product board will have functions and powers that mirror the Corporation's. However, mindful of the great diversity in horticultural industries and the need to ensure the product board structure is not unnecessarily rigid, the Bill provides for the functions of a particular board to be tailored to the products it covers. For example, the dried vine fruits industry runs a very active private industry marketing program in Australia and there is no need for statutory involvement in this. The Australian Dried Fruits Board will exercise only export activities and the functions relating to domestic activities are set to be removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        A product board is to be empowered to control exports through the inclusion of new clauses in part V of the Horticultural Corporation Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has agreed to the continuation of the current range of export controls for dried vine fruits. I would expect that these controls will be exercised by the Australian Dried Fruits Board as conditions of export licensing under export licences issued by the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister is empowered to give directions to boards under the same circumstances as apply to the Corporation, that is only in exceptional circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        A product board is to comprise an independent chairperson selected by the Corporation in consultation with the relevant producer organisation and five other members. All board members are to be appointed by the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each of the members other than the chairperson is to be selected by the relevant industry body so that each of the areas of expertise identified for these other board members is represented. In line with the Government's recently announced policy, no age limit is to apply to members.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because a product board is likely to have coverage of quite a narrow product or group of products, it is important that it can draw on product specific advice and expertise from within its membership. The selection criteria therefore provide for 3 of the 5 board members to have such expertise. The other two members may be drawn from more general areas and in any case the board will have recourse to the expertise of Corporation members for more broad ranging advice if necessary. The selection process is not formalised in the same way as it is for statutory marketing authorities because of the product-specific nature that its membership will have.
       </para>
       <para>
        The representative industry body for products covered by a board is in the best position to identify such members. I would nonetheless expect that the selection process adopted by industry bodies will be a disciplined one that will withstand scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision is made for the chairperson to be a member of the Corporation board or be drawn from outside the Corporation's membership. In either case, attendance at corporation meetings will provide an important opportunity for the corporation to monitor regularly board activities and provision is therefore made for the chairperson, if not a member of the Corporation, to attend meetings if requested.
       </para>
       <para>
        A product board's membership does not include a government member as each board will have regular access to the advice of the government member of the Corporation. A board would still be free to request an officer of my Department to attend a product board meeting if this was considered necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        A board will have a general manager and its own staff. For the Australian Dried Fruits Board, the existing staff of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation will become the employees of the new board.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for the Corporation, a board will be required to prepare corporate and annual operating plans which will be subject to the approval of the Corporation. To assist in the process of assessing a board's effectiveness, and in keeping with recently announced government policy, a board will be required to develop, in consultation with its industry bodies, performance indicators. These indicators are to then be included in both the planning and reporting process. Once prepared, board plans will contribute to the preparation of the Corporation's plans.
       </para>
       <para>
        A board will contribute to the overheads of the Corporation and this arrangement will be set out in regulations. I would expect the Corporation and the relevant industry body covered by a board to contribute substantially to identifying this share on an equitable basis. The cost will nonetheless reflect the activities that the board will undertake in its own right which, for other participant industries, will be provided by the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bill sets out the mechanism for payment of funds to a board and for the payment of costs to the Corporation such that both payments are to be made at the same time to each body. Amendment to the Horticultural Levy and Export Charge Acts and the associated collection Acts is necessary for this to occur and these are provided for in parts 5 to 8 of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's recently announced policy on accountability to levy payers now requires that annual general meetings be held. In conformity with this policy, the Australian Dried Fruits Board will be required to account annually to its levy payers through an annual general meeting. In due course, the Australian Horticultural Corporation will also be required to hold annual general meetings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions the board's annual general meetings, contained in division 4 of the new part IV, have been designed to take account of the broader corporate structure within which the Dried Fruits Board is to operate. Provision is therefore made for the chairpersons of both the board and the Corporation to present reports and for the board chairperson to present the board's last audited financial statements. As well, levy payers will be able to debate and vote upon changes to the rates of levy and export charge and, in the extreme case, on motions of no confidence in the board chairperson and members.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only levy payers of dried vine fruit will be eligible to vote at the annual general meeting of the Australian Dried Fruits Board and provision is made for the board to establish a register of such persons for each meeting. Voting entitlements will be relative to levy paid. The detailed procedures for convening a meeting and establishing the register of voters will be set out in regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth will continue to collect and disburse industry levies to fund the operations of the Australian Dried Fruits Board as is the case for the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. Costs of these activities are fully recovered by the Commonwealth and there are no costs to Consolidated Revenue which will result from the Bill.

       </para>
       <para>
        I have moved the amendments because of the Opposition's concern about the slowness of the Minister in bringing reports from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) and its councils to this Parliament. In our view, it would be better if the Act were tightened so that there is a requirement on the Minister to bring reports before us in a speedier fashion than is the case at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments do nothing to reform the whole defective structure of advice and decision making that applies to education at present; they cannot make NBEET and its councils genuinely separate from the Minister; and they cannot stop politically motivated decision making by the Minister. What the amendments can do is speed up the time in which these reports are provided to Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report of the Higher Education Council (HEC) which was presented to the Board last August did not reach us in this Parliament until November. It took six weeks for the report to get from the Board to the Minister. The report was not presented to Parliament until November. The present requirement allowing up to 15 sitting days is permitting this unjustifiably long time for reports to reach us and the public. For there to be healthy debate in any policy area, there needs to be adequate information; and in higher education, there needs to be access by the interested public to these documents as quickly as possible. Thus the Opposition seeks to speed up the process by changing the requirement from 15 to five sitting days. There is no doubt that the 15 days allowed have been abused, frankly, by the Government, which has stretched them to as long a time as possible.

One can stretch them into longer days by determining the non-sitting periods and bringing reports in in such a way that the presentation of that information can be delayed for 8 1/2 weeks and has been. One wonders, in view of that response, whether it is not deliberate by this Government-a deliberate stretching, a deliberate set of delays, pushing the delay factor as long as it possibly can. What its motives are, I do not know. I do not attribute generous ones to it, because it is not in this Government's interests obviously to provide information speedily and properly to this chamber.

        I dare say that the Government will try to tell us that this is not practical and it all takes longer and so on. Quite frankly, there is no cause to believe the Government on that score. The Government is not being anything more than a postbox, a sort of monumentally inefficient Australia Post-I look at the Minister and that concept comes to me-if it takes 7 1/2 weeks. I will give examples in a minute to cheer the Minister up about how this 15 days has been stretched into 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 weeks.

One could say that the average weight of the Government is something; that does not mean there are not some very large members of the Government. We are objecting and complaining about particular instances. We are not asking the Minister to add something to the report as it comes through his dilatory letterbox. We are asking simply for the Minister to pass the report on to the people for whom it is intended-the Parliament and the people. If the Minister were wanting to make some commentary on these things, maybe he might have some justification for spending so much time doing it. But there is no policy statement, as I said.

        All we want is to require the Minister-because obviously it is not going to be done unless there is a requirement-to respond promptly and to convey promptly to us what has been conveyed to him. I believe that it is entirely practical for the printing and other arrangements to be accomplished so that tabling can occur within five sitting days.

       <para>
        Perhaps to cheer up the Minister, I should give him the instances which he seeks to hide under a cloak of averages. I do not know whether the Minister's average relates only to section 25 reports or to any other reports. But I want to deal specifically with section 25 reports. When the Minister ceases getting briefed he may be able to--

         —Let us see how thin this argument is: why did it take-perhaps the Minister in charge of the matter will be able to explain this to us-8 1/2 weeks? The first report of 1989 went from HEC to NBEET, I think, on 23 February; it was endorsed by NBEET on 24 February; on 2 March it went from NBEET to the Minister; and it was tabled in the Senate on 4 May. It took 8 1/2 weeks.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On 21 August 1989-the Parliament was sitting-HEC sent the second report to NBEET; it was endorsed by NBEET on 25 August; NBEET sent it to the Minister on 31 August and it was tabled in the Senate on 25 October. Perhaps Senator Collins thinks that is remarkable expedition. It may be when it is relative to what Senator Collins thinks is speed. We have seen his speed in trying to fix up the waterfront, and his year is about to run out.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the third report: on 15 February HEC sent it to NBEET; on 22 to 23 February it was endorsed by NBEET; on 9 April NBEET sent it to the Minister, and there was a delay apparently in the appointment of a Minister of some kind. In other words, it took six weeks, until 17 May, for it to be tabled in the Senate. On 15 August 1990, HEC sent that report to NBEET; on 23 to 24 August it was endorsed by NBEET; on 28 September, NBEET sent it to the Minister; on 26 November it was tabled in the Senate-8 1/2 weeks later.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government seriously intends to oppose these amendments, I would be grateful if it could explain to us why there were these delays. I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) is handling this matter. I have given him the specific dates and he has heard them all. If he genuinely believes that the Government is doing a good job, can he explain to us why those delays took place? While he is at it, he can explain to us why the annual report has taken so long to be sent to us. This is required by section 9 and, as I understand it, the annual report was transmitted to the Minister last year on 24 September and it took until 7 November to go through the letterbox of the Minister's office.
       </para>
       <para>
        All I suppose we can say is, `Thank heavens this Minister is not running Australia Post because we would never get any mail'. Perhaps there are those people who say, `You never do anyway'. But this is just ludicrous. If this Minister's attempt to be a letterbox is as incompetent as this, something should be done about it, and that is why we are moving these amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also ask the Minister while he is resolving these problems: since the present Act is still operative, was a report prepared by HEC in February this year? Has it yet reached NBEET or the Minister? When will it be tabled? Will we wait another 8 1/2 weeks for this one too?

         —The honourable senator should not be more boring than usual. As Senator Baume, Senator Teague and most people in this chamber would be aware-certainly anyone who has been in this place for any time-the standard time for tabling these sorts of reports is 15 days from the date of receipt. There is nothing unusual about that 15 days. Can it be said that in the case of this body there has been such a volume of extraordinary behaviour that the criteria that apply to every other government instrumentality should not apply to this one; its relationship with the Parliament has been so extraordinary that we need to punish it by imposing a particular requirement?

        I understand, although I have not actually seen an example of it, but theoretically it would seem to me to be possible, that a 15-day sitting rule could be abused because of the lengthy periods between sittings-say, between the autumn and the Budget sitting or between the Budget sitting, et cetera.

         —I understand. What I am saying is that that has not applied on any of these occasions. If there were a consistent pattern that an instrumentality behave in such a manner that it took all the intervening period-between June and August or between December and February-March, so that it had three or four months during which 15 sitting days elapsed-that could constitute an abuse of its proper position in such a way that the Senate might be concerned. In all the dates that I have in front of me, including those to which Senator Baume referred, there is not one instance where such an abuse has taken place, they have all been within a period of sittings.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Baume made no reference to some comparative figure which said that this body had behaved so inordinately badly that it must be punished or singled out. I think that is a very flimsy argument. If this were a murder trial, I think the judge would stop at the end of the prosecution's submission and say, ` There is no case to answer. No body has been found and no motive has been established'. That is the circumstance we have here. There is no indication that an extraordinary situation has occurred over and above the norm, and not even Senator Baume could conjecture about a motive as to why anybody would want to participate in some sort of obscure behaviour in the way that he has performed. If Senator Baume cannot conceive a motive, I suspect that nobody can, because he is very good at those things. I think, therefore, that we really have a case of him desperately coming up with an argument to justify an amendment moved by one of his colleagues. It is very loyal of him, but it does not constitute a case why an otherwise sensible provision ought to be made extraordinary and nonsensical.
       </para>
       <para>
        This `acting as a post box' argument was whimsical and was in Senator Baume's best musical vaudeville-style comedy. I did not mean to downplay some of his more operatic contributions, but it obviously is more than that. It is more than simply receiving the report and tabling it; physical preparation of the document is required. If the five-day period is introduced, given the practical difficulties outlined last night by Senator Collins-I will not take the time of the Senate to reiterate them, they are stark and evident to everybody-it may well be that all those preliminary processes to get the report ready for tabling that at this stage take place between when it is presented to the Minister and when it is tabled in the Parliament will take place before it is presented to the Minister and there will be a hidden delay.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will not be a public situation where the document is presented. The Government has a fixed period to deal with all the proper requirements for its presentation. There will be a hidden delay where all the Minister gets is the final version. He will probably get a draft report, but the final version for tabling will only come after the printing and processing have been done. It could be tabled in half a day but nobody will have gained anything. It will simply make less transparent what is perfectly transparent at the moment. I think that, to allow the briefings to be prepared and printing to be done, rather than to speed anything up, is more likely to result in delay of the transmission of reports to the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Parliament will be no better served. It will be simply a case that for a reason that is somewhere buried in a concern Senator Teague had before the Estimates Committee, as far as I can recall, we will make an extraordinary amendment, which has no parallel, as far as I can find, in the reporting requirements of statutory organisations on the basis of no evidence that this body has abused its responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it would be a great pity if the Senate were to do this. It would not be a proper discharge of the Senate's obligation as a responsible chamber. It would not enhance the effective reporting requirements at all. It would simply be changing the time at which various preparatory things take place from what is a totally transparent requirement now, where all those things take place within 15 days, to a less transparent subsequent process.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge those who are currently contemplating supporting this amendment not to do so because the legislation will be made the less workable for no advantage. It may well mean that other statutory authorities of the Government will continue to be subjected to this sort of silly little harassment for no advantage in the administration of public policy. I think it is important that bodies such as this and others which report take their accountability responsibilities to the Parliament seriously. It is a matter that I, as a senator, take seriously, and I would encourage and insist that bodies reporting to us also discharge their obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        From time to time matters have been raised by Senator Baume among others in discussions about Government papers about the delays in the presentation of annual reports. Some of those seem to me to have been perfectly justifiable criticisms because bodies have not been properly discharging their obligations to Parliament. I think that is an important question, but it is not what is in question at the moment. We do not have any evidence of abuse. We do not have anything that says this is such an extraordinary circumstance that normal requirements should not apply. I urge honourable senators to reject the amendment.

        For these delays to have taken place, it needs a consistent pattern of the report being presented to the Minister on the Friday of a two-week sitting period, it not counting as a sitting day, the following two weeks not counting as a sitting day, a fortnight's sittings counting as seven sitting days and another two weeks not counting as a sitting day. On the first week of what is almost a fifth set of sitting days the report will eventually be tabled. For these figures to appear there has to be a consistent pattern--

However, I was certainly not convinced by the display-it was an attempt but not a convincing one-in that the best answer that I could distil from it was that, if these amendments are accepted, the physical preparation will take place before the Minister receives the document. In passing, as I understood it, the Parliamentary Secretary said that in fact, after that, the tabling could take place in half a day.

        That does not convince me that the amendments are faulty or inconvenient in any way, shape or form. When the argument for these amendments was first presented to us by the coalition I found it convincing. Looking at the situation as it then was, without any other contribution and without any other attempt at dismissing those amendments, I found myself quite ready to accept them.

        The coalition's amendments had been provided to the Government, as they had been provided to us. The coalition's argument is, as it was then and as it has been presented here, backed up by evidence. In a vacuum of information from the Government to refute that, I cannot see any reason to move from where we are at the moment. That vacuum has certainly not been filled at the moment by the Government's contribution.

        There is something at the heart of this. The Australian Democrats are not capable-and I use the word very carefully-of acquiring by any process of osmosis, mirrors or magic any of the Government's resources and information that might be necessary to refute such arguments presented by the coalition. The Parliamentary Secretary himself made mention of the limited time available for research; it was just as limited for us.

        We do not share the Government's principles; we do not share the Government's philosophies; and we do not share the Government's political directions.

The only thing I can see here is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that what would take place in the interim between the Minister receiving the document and the Minister tabling the document will now take place before, and that it could be tabled in half a day. That has not convinced me.

         —I understand Senator Baume's embarrassment though, Mr Chairman, because it is unbelievable that a person could have been in Parliament for as long as Senator Baume and fail to understand that elementary matter. It seems to me that both Senator Baume and Senator Bell are getting what this provision is about back to front. It is not that there is some particular import in the speed with which these reports get from the Minister to the Senate. The fundamental requirement we want is for the information to get from the statutory authority-not just this one but all the bodies to which this would apply-to the Senate and the House of Representatives chambers, which I regard as equally important in this matter, as quickly as possible. That is what we want.
        </para>

       <para>
        What I am saying is that this amendment will not achieve that at all. It may slow it down. It will make it less obvious to us whether it is happening or not. That is my point. There is no magic about the speed with which it gets from the Minister's office to the Senate. That is a matter properly for scrutiny and, in the proper manner that things occur at the moment, the 15-day rule achieves a reasonable objective in getting things quickly from the statutory authority to the Senate. As to the average of 42 days, it is all very well to say that there are four examples where it is longer, but obviously it follows that there are several examples when it is quicker and no particular example of motivation why anybody would want to delay.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that on at least one of these occasions-and it is the only occasion about which I have been able to get a briefing because it is the only one in which the officers here available to me have been involved-there was a problem of a delay with the printing of the document. That is not remarkable. We have all had problems and delays in printing documents for which we have been responsible, not just as members of parliament but in all the various public and private activities which all the people around this chamber have undertaken-whether it is Senator Harradine in his trade union role before he came in, Senator Bell on the city council or whatever it is. From time to time we have all been beset with problems where printers for the best of reasons-and sometimes we might all think for the worst of reasons-delay what it is we wanted them to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I want to say to honourable senators is: take a step back from the immediate amendments and ask: what is it that the provision exists for? The provision exists properly to ensure that information which comes from a body with an obligation to report to both the Houses of Parliament gets there as expeditiously as possible. If it is the view of honourable senators that a body is being recalcitrant, there exists the proper forum of the legislative and general purpose committees to which the annual reports of all these bodies go and where this can be pursued. They could go to the Estimates committees, but I think that the legislative and general purpose committees are probably a better example. I know that Senator Bell is a member of the relevant legislative and general purpose committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there is a view, after cross-examining this body, that it is not discharging its obligations correctly, then it might be appropriate for the Senate to take some action. But in this great vacuum of information we should not be taking this extraordinary action on this one-off occasion, of which there is no other example that I am aware of, without having had the opportunity in the legislative and general purpose or Estimates committees to pursue whether there has been an extraordinary pattern. We have an arithmetical argument which is not particularly edifying, but let us assume just for the sake of the argument that Senator Baume is right and that there is some pattern in some, but not all, of the cases that are before us. We have not had any attempt to use the proper forums available to all of us to pursue that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to extend this debate any further. The walls of the Government will not collapse if this amendment is carried. It just will not improve the Senate's reputation as a responsible body which amends legislation sensibly. On the grounds of cogent argument, the Senate will not be enhanced by such an amendment. I hope we do not carry it and I urge those opposite to reconsider.

       <para>
        MARINE NAVIGATION (REGULATORY FUNCTIONS) LEVY BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision in the last budget to recover the costs of marine safety and regulation from the industry that benefits from this regulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maritime and safety regulatory functions include ship control and ship safety-related activities, bulk cargo and dangerous goods inspections and the administration of the Marine Council. These functions were transferred to the new Australian Maritime Safety Authority on 1 January 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The levy will be imposed on all sea-going ships except those exempted by regulation. The ships that will be exempt are those that are exempt from payment of the existing navigation levy and include commercial ships under 24 metres, fishing vessels, pleasure craft and ships in ballast.
       </para>
       <para>
        The levy will be phased in over three years with full cost recovery by the 1993/94 financial year. The present cost of providing these services is currently estimated at $7.1 million dollars per year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The formula for calculating the levy is similar to the existing Marine Navigation Levy and is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 2 to 4 cents per net registered ton, with the rate per net ton being reduced as the ship's tonnage increases. The maritime industry was invited to propose alternatives to this method but no practical alternative was put forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also allows the rate of levy to be varied by regulation. However, after the phasing in period has been completed, the annual rate of increase in the levy which may be effected by regulation will be limited to an absolute maximum of 15 per cent. Any actual increase in the levy effected in this way will be related to reasonable cost increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        To summarise, Mr President, this Bill and its associated collection Bill will provide funding to ensure that ship safety standards and the protection of the marine environment will continue to be maintained.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        MARINE NAVIGATION (REGULATORY FUNCTIONS) LEVY COLLECTION
       </para>
       <para>
        BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill sets out the necessary procedures for the collection of the proposed regulatory functions levy and provides minor amendments to other legislation.
       </para>

        It provides for the levy to be paid to a Collector of Customs or an authorised person. The levy will not be payable merely because a ship calls at an Australian port for shelter, repairs or refitting, to take on provisions, to change crew or to land a crew member for medical treatment.

         —I wish to make an explanation in respect of the first readings of these Bills. There was some confusion about whether these Bills should be adjourned at the first reading stage and I just want to indicate the background to that. Apparently the Clerks were under the impression that we intended to move a first reading amendment. If we had done so, it would have enabled senators to speak at length on wide-ranging topics. I might just point out that, while that indication was given to the Senate by somebody, it was not my intention to do so and that thus explains the confusion.

       <para>
        Tonight we are cognately debating the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Bill 1991 and the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Collection Bill 1991. Maritime safety and regulatory functions were transferred to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) on 1 January 1991. The organisation was established by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act which was passed towards the end of last year. It incorporates a number of Federal Government operations that provide navigational services to commercial shipping interests, such as lighthouses, navigational buoys, markers and so forth, all of which are essential to the safe operation of recreational boating and maritime operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two pieces of legislation now before us propose to impose a sliding scale of levy on seagoing ships to recover the costs of maritime safety and regulatory functions carried out by AMSA for the commercial shipping industry. It is proposed in the Bills that the levy will be phased in over three years, with a target of full cost recovery for the financial year 1993-94. These pieces of legislation give effect to the decision announced on 21 August 1990 to recover costs of maritime safety and regulatory functions carried out by AMSA from the commercial shipping industry by imposing the levy, and the collection Bill provides for the administration of that levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The imposition of the levy itself is in step with the principle of full cost recovery-apart, of course, from the non-community service functions and obligations-from those who benefit from those services provided by Government business enterprise rather than from the taxpayer. I think it is worth pointing out to honourable senators that it is in fact indirectly another tax on exporters. While the user pays concept is part of these Bills and the industry has indicated acceptance of the charge, it should be pointed out that what we are seeing is a continuation of what I believe to be a somewhat disturbing practice by the Government of introducing new charges and thus getting the cost of regulatory functions off-Budget.

         —Senator, I agree with the concept, as I indicated. The Minister was not listening earlier. There is a disturbing feature of more and more additional charges being made which take the costs off-Budget. What we do not see, of course, is any subsequent reduction in government expenditure as a result of those charges being placed on the users.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The new charge amounts to something in the order of $7.1m a year. Again, I see no mention at all, with that new charge being placed on the users, of any equivalent reduction in government expenditure. Presumably, when these things are cumulative, we will have the Government saying that it has reduced government revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition opposed the establishment of AMSA as yet another unwanted statutory authority. We saw the classic case of a pork-barrelling attempt. The initial proposal was to move AMSA to Newcastle, with a cost blow-out from an estimated $6m or $7m to some $20m which, of course, the industry would have been forced to pay through the levy. There is no doubt-and I think I mentioned this in the AMSA debate-that if AMSA was already in Newcastle it should have stayed there. But as it was here in Canberra, with modern transportation and communications being what they are, to move it to Newcastle would have been nothing more or less than a blatant and disgraceful waste of $20m of taxpayers' money. Fortunately, the proponents were headed of at the eleventh hour. I notice, by the happy smiles and nods of Senator Collins, that he was the instigator of heading that off at the pass. I understand that by doing so he earned a lot of opprobrium from some of his colleagues.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this legislation the Government has placed an upper limit of 15 per cent on levy increases. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has pointed out that the levy increases are without a ceiling until 1993. I do not know whether this is an oversight or deliberate. Perhaps the Minister will explain the reason for that. If he cannot do so, I foreshadow that I will move an amendment at the committee stage to ensure that the ceiling is in place when this legislation comes into effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also seek to ask the Minister: why a 15 per cent ceiling? It appears to be quite an arbitrary figure which provides a rise clause far in excess of any anticipated inflation rate-unless, of course, the Government's continued mismanagement of the economy makes that figure a distinct possibility. The Opposition has a second reading amendment which has been circulated and which I now move:
       </para>
       <para>
        At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate condemns the Government for its failure to reduce the costs which it has imposed through inefficiencies and inadequate reform in the Australian shipping industry, placing a competitive disadvantage on Australian exporters''.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment is designed to give us an opportunity to highlight the enormous burden this Government is imposing on users of navigational services that AMSA provides. In addition, our desire was to broaden the debate to cover the full spectrum of issues relating to the costs which governments impose on shippers and upon those who use shipping services, such as manufacturers, exporters and importers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the years that I have been in this place I have highlighted the shameful inefficiencies, the disgraceful work practices and our appalling reputation for nonsensical industrial disputation on the waterfront-not just the wharfies themselves but in regard to things like the Seamen's Union of Australia, tug operators and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are an island continent and a major trading nation. Of our major exports of primary products and mining, we export something in the order of 80 per cent of our production. One of the most important aspects of exporting, on a par with costs, is reliability of supply.
       </para>
       <para>
        From experience I can tell the Senate that it is no fun going overseas, trying to increase exports and being beaten over the head by buyers about disruptive strikes. When that happens-and over the years it has happened to me quite often-one cannot help but feel ashamed by the actions of a few fellow Australians who have given the impression that they are doing nothing more or less than sabotaging our export effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dented pride, however, is nothing compared to the loss of exports which irresponsible actions have cost this country, and cost this country dearly. I know that major importers in Japan and Korea have deliberately pegged their purchases from Australia-at a cost to them, because there is a cost of diversification-because they could not and would not afford the risk of being held to ransom by seamen or other waterfront workers. Who will forget the so-called `Wran's Navy'-the massive queues of foreign vessels in Newcastle and Wollongong waiting to pick up cargo, each vessel costing between $10,000 and $20,000 a day because of disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can recall, from my own experience again, being told quite explicitly by overseas buyers and also in South East Asia, which is the market at which we should be directing ourselves, that they had pegged exports of bulk commodity products to something like 47 per cent because the risk was too great. But by doing so they had to purchase the other materials from countries such as the United States of America and Poland and pay a higher price. This was a great source of embarrassment to us and we had to advise them why a certain dispute had taken place. I recall one company that decided to go into its own shipping simply to enable it to forecast the freight rates it had to pay between here and Europe, because it was attempting to go into the European market.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the problems of selling bulk commodities into the European market is the volatility of freight rates on ships, particularly when selling on a c.i.f and e. or c.i.f. and c. basis. That company acquired a number of ships which enabled it to acquire those markets. That company was doing the same thing as the Japanese and the Koreans, but in reverse. The company was diversifying overseas because of the lid that was put on them by the South East Asian companies. It had a vessel that ended up at Port Stanvac in South Australia. It was called the Lake Berryessa, and I remember it well. It was held up there for six months while the Seamen's Union of Australia demanded that the crew on that vessel be changed for Australian crews so that in those days the numbers on that ship would go from 23 to 46.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that there have been substantial improvements, but I give this as an indication of the sort of thing that happened. The only way in which that dispute was settled was by the company invoking section 45B of the Trade Practices Act. That threat brought the dispute to an end. But the sad, final chapter is that that company then decided it was not worth while pursuing operations with its own vessels, even though it had predictable freight rates between here and Europe, and it gave up the market. This sort of reputation takes a lot of living down.

        The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, in an attempt to show that he is succeeding on micro- economic reform on the waterfront is trumpeting agreements with CTAL and Conaust. Any improvement, I would be the first to admit, is better than nothing.

But so far I have seen no indication that there is any recognition whatever that we must aim to have the most efficient, the most cost effective and best turnaround times in the world if we are even to be in the race to do something about our chronic current account deficit and foreign debt. We must be aiming at being the best. Not only do we have a bad waterfront problem, but we are a long way from markets. We have the tyranny of distance which has been written about so frequently. Therefore, we have to do better than anyone else.

        Although I indicated that any improvements is better than nothing, it achieves little if we are 20 per cent or 30 per cent better than we were before but if, as a result, we are only 40 per cent as efficient as comparable overseas ports such as Yokohama, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam. Often people quote Singapore and I am told that perhaps one should not quote Singapore because it is a hub-type port, but the simple fact is that we must aim not to be better than we were, but equal to or better than any other port in the world. When it is cheaper by some $600 per vehicle and safer for the Ford and Nissan companies to fly cars from Melbourne to Auckland than by ship, then we have a long way to go.

Anything that the Minister or this Government does to move in that direction, to seek excellence, will be supported by the Opposition. But neither the Minister nor the Government can be taken seriously on micro-economic reform until the Government takes action to stop these sorts of insidious practices. In other words, it must get rid of cabotage between Australia and New Zealand.

         —I think that I have given the Minister the answer. Let me touch briefly on coastal shipping going back many years. It has never ceased to amaze me that it is cheaper, more efficient and safer to move half a dozen motor vehicles by way of a semi-trailer from Melbourne to my own city of Brisbane than to put a hundred on a roll-on roll-off vessel and move those same motor vehicles from Melbourne to Brisbane. Why? That cannot be the case. In a cost comparison it cannot be cheaper to move those vehicles on rubber than by way of vessels, that is, if we were permitted to do so.

        Until that time comes, I frankly cannot see how we will be able to tackle the awful economic problems confronting this country.

As an island continent and a great trader, we should have a greater merchant navy. We do not.

        In conclusion, I repeat: if the Government makes serious moves to confront the real issues of the cabotage and the work practices that still exist and makes a genuine effort to create the most cost effective and efficient ports in the world, it will have the support of this Opposition. But until it does so, its credibility on micro-economic reform will go nowhere.

We canvassed all of these arguments in the debate on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and I do not intend to use this opportunity to launch into a set piece on waterfront reform. We should acknowledge that some progress is being made in this complex area. It is not as swift as the Opposition would like, but it is being made. I would argue that it is much more important that it be made in this area than in the area of telecommunications.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to address my comments to the difficulty the Democrats have with some of the procedures set in train by these Bills-specifically, the way in which the Government could be seen to be using regulation to erode parliamentary power.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first Bill, the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Bill 1991, sets out in subclause 7(2) the various rates of levy which would apply to ships when the Bill is enacted. In each case an amount of levy per tonne is specified, but there is also the proviso:
       </para>
       <para>
        or such other amount as is from time to time prescribed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This prescription will be by regulation. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has drawn attention to this subclause in terms of the inappropriate delegation of legislative power. The Committee draws attention specifically to the fact that, although the levy cannot be increased by more than 15 per cent in any 12 consecutive months, this prohibition does not come into force until June 1993. So up until this date there is no limit on the amount that such a levy can be increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Parer foreshadowed an Opposition amendment to clarify this position. He said that the levy was really a form of taxation. Much depends on how much is charged. If the levy were to be increased from, say, 4c a tonne to $4 a tonne, we could say that the levy appears to be a tax and, as such, it should be a matter for Parliament. I agree with Senator Parer that there is a disturbing trend to take matters off Budget. Who knows, as I often say, what is going to happen to Telecom's community service obligations should they find their way off Budget?
       </para>
       <para>
        However, with respect to this, we should also consider that the Government is on record as having made a deliberate decision to phase in the levy over three years-starting at 35 per cent cost recovery in year one, increasing to 70 per cent in year two and 100 per cent in year three. It was a deliberate decision. The Government has a reason for it, and I am sure that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) will elaborate on that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The costs that are to be recovered have never been recovered previously. I guess it is possible that, if the implementation date were brought forward by Senator Parer's amendment to the date of proclamation, industry would be prepared to comply. Our view on this amendment depends, too, on what view we may have of this Government's intention with respect to revenue raising between now and 1993.

        The second Bill, the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Collection Bill 1991, provides for the administration of the levy imposed by the first Bill that we are debating. Clause 7 of the Bill provides for the ways in which the levy is to be collected. Subclause 4 provides for payment to be made personally, by post addressed to the Collector, or-by paragraph (c)-as otherwise prescribed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is this paragraph (c) which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has drawn attention to. It is a Henry VIII clause, as it allows the amendment, by regulation, of the methods of payment as set out in the legislation. While this is a more mild version of a Henry VIII clause than some others we have seen in this place, nevertheless I want to emphasise the fact that this is not a good way for any government to attempt to operate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I want to draw attention to a subclause which is cause for greater concern, that is, subclause 11(2), which says:
       </para>
       <para>
        the regulations may provide for the refund or remission (in whole or in part) of an amount of levy paid or payable in respect of a ship in such circumstances as are specified in the regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, whose deliberations we should treat with great consideration, points out that there is no guidance as to the grounds on which a levy could be refunded or remitted. This would be left up to the regulations. While such regulations would be disallowable, there would be no scope within the process of disallowance for the Parliament to have input into such regulations. Accordingly, I will be moving an amendment to clarify the process of refunding or remitting the levy.

       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill is consistent with the practice, adopted over many years, of introducing an annual Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        A Loan Bill is required this year because it now appears that the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be in deficit although the Budget as a whole is still expected to remain in surplus. The situation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund being in deficit while the Budget is in surplus arises because appropriations from the Fund include various items that are classified as financing transactions rather than budget outlays, so that they do not affect the budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the Loan Fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated by Parliament, apart from loan raising expenses, which will be small. It is important that the Bill be passed as soon as possible so that necessary borrowings authorised under the Bill to finance the deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund can be accommodated within the Government's normal seasonal pattern of raisings.
       </para>
       <para>
        In concluding, I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge upon the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate public moneys, but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

         —Today a notice of motion in the name of Senator Brownhill to establish a joint select committee to inquire into the Family Law Act was declared formal and agreed to. I now take the opportunity on the adjournment of saying a few words about the Family Law Act. Since the Act came into operation, as at 31 December 1989 there have been 599,496 divorces, and a total of 705,279 children have been directly affected. As I understand it, those figures are to the end of December 1989. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act will have a very important task. There is probably no other piece of Commonwealth legislation which has produced such continuing animosity from the ordinary people who have come under its operation. It is often said that the difficulty lies in the administration of what is essentially a law which perpetuates injustice. I note that the terms of reference for the Committee are somewhat limited, but I believe that it will be necessary for the Chairman of the Committee and the Committee itself to accept submissions made to it from people who are concerned that they have suffered injustice as a result of the operations of the Act and other factors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Brownhill has indicated that there will be a focus on the questions of reconciliation counselling and property and custody matters. It is important for the Senate to recall at this juncture that a terrible tragedy has been wreaked upon the community as a result of the number of divorces. This is a matter of concern and hurt particularly amongst those directly involved, and that surely is the most important matter for us to consider. But it also has an effect on the Commonwealth Budget. Some years ago I took out a figure which even then ran to something like $1.2 billion directly paid out by the Commonwealth as a result of the dissolution of marriage.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been a number of identifiable problems. The report on homeless children stated that a very substantial percentage of homeless youth have parents whose marriages have broken up. That also is surely a matter for consideration by the Committee, and no doubt there will be submissions which go to that aspect. I remind the Senate that some years ago-I think on 6 October 1983-I moved amendments to the Family Law Amendment Bill which received quite substantial support. Those amendments would have required a party to a marriage, 12 months prior to applying for a dissolution thereof, to undergo, together with the other party, counselling for the purpose of considering the legal, social and financial consequences of the dissolution of the marriage-in particular, the effect of that dissolution on any children of the marriage. Unfortunately, though that proposal received very substantial support, it was defeated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is necessary to point out that the counselling services of the Family Court of Australia provide largely, if not exclusively, divorce counselling, not reconciliation counselling. No doubt the Committee will be aware of section 43 of the Family Law Act, which asks questions of the Family Court counselling services as to whether the counselling has been effective and in accordance with the legislation. I remind the Senate of the provisions of section 43 of the Family Law Act, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Family Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children;
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their welfare; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) the means available for assisting parties to a marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps this Committee, at the end of the day, will be able to come forward with recommendations to improve the relationships between spouses and encourage the parties to the marriage to consider the effect of any possible dissolution on their own happiness, their own livelihood and the happiness and future of their children. I think an expectation has built up over a period as to what might come out of this inquiry. One finds from the letters one receives that there is a great deal of hurt out there in society. A great many people are carrying on their shoulders the burden of what they see as an injustice. Whatever happens, I believe that the Committee should receive the submissions that are made and consider them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that the terms of reference will not be interpreted narrowly. I know that my colleagues around the place, both here and in the House of Representatives, are concerned about this. I hope-indeed, I am confident from the feedback that I am getting-that it will not be the intention of persons I have spoken to to have the terms of reference narrowly interpreted. If people who feel as though they have suffered an injustice are not able to express themselves freely to the Committee, their frustration will be compounded, and I do not think that would be a good thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part of our function here is a representative function. One of the ways that we exercise that function is to get information and submissions from constituents. I do not suppose there is one single member of parliament, either in this House or in the other, who has not received numerous representations concerning the operation of the Family Law Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I see this as a first step. I hope that the Committee's considerations and recommendations will start to improve the situation, which needs to be improved not only for the individual welfare of married persons themselves and their children but for society as a whole.

         —First, I thank Senator Harradine for again reminding the Senate of the number of people involved with divorce, the number of children involved in divorce and the cost associated with divorce. He also talked of the heartbreak of people associated with divorce whose marriages have ended up in failure. One area he did not mention-and I am sure that this was only an oversight on his part and that he would have mentioned it had he thought of it-was the heartbreak for the grandparents when they see their children's marriages break up. In some cases, they do not even have access to their grandchildren. That is an area that we must all think about.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are the problems caused with property settlements, particularly in the case of country properties. I know of cases where a father and son have built up a property over a lifetime and then, because of a property settlement following the divorce of the son, the property has had to be sold. As a result, the father and mother have had to move off the property. So there are problems in this respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Harradine mentioned that a number of submissions would be sent to the Joint Select Committee into Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. Because of the feeling amongst all people in this Parliament that something needs to be done to remedy some parts of the Act that are not working quite as well as people would hope, I am quite sure that the Committee will take into account the submissions that are put to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe the terms of reference are too narrow. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats, some of my colleagues and I helped to set the terms of reference in such a way that they are not too confined. This has been done so that at the end of the day we will be able to make some good recommendations so that things will be little bit better in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very pleased that my motion was passed by the Senate tonight. I have been talking about it for some two years. In fact, it was introduced last May. I want to thank senators from all parties and persuasions in this chamber who, privately and publicly, supported this inquiry and who understand the reason it is so important that the inquiry proceed with haste. I also thank Senator Tate for his contribution and the help and support that he gave me earlier on. I will not go through all the names of members in the House of Representatives from all sides of politics who feel that there should be an inquiry. I hope that the motion to establish the Committee has a speedy passage through the other place.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a couple of points that I want to briefly canvass tonight. I believe the terms of reference as outlined are fairly comprehensive. I was concerned that the terms ought to reflect genuine community concerns while at the same time not be so broad as to render the inquiry unworkable. I believe that these terms cover most, if not exactly all, the points of view that have been put to me. As can be seen from the terms, there is an emphasis on the role of counselling and mediation-which Senator Harradine has already mentioned-and I believe that is very appropriate. It is important that the mediation and counselling be pursued if they can prevent the irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
       </para>
       <para>
        Marriages ought not to fail for want of proper and timely counselling. It is only right that any inquiry into family law also examine the role and effectiveness of the counselling service. It was equally important in my view that custody and access be given high priority. Probably no other aspect of family law is more contentious than this, nor more heartbreaking. Similarly, reference is made to effective enforcement of rights and duties under the Act. Again, there is a perception, a view, that the Family Court of Australia lacks teeth and there is a need for court orders to be enforced. So we need to see whether the Act is at fault or whether its interpretation and administration could be strengthened or better worded.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the revised terms, reference is made in part (c) to the question of property disputes arising out of de facto relationships. Before anyone is able to accuse me of anything or to read any motive into this, I would like to put a couple of points on record. I am a great believer in the institution of marriage. I do not support, nor do I particularly approve of, the concept of de facto relationships. But I also live in the real world. What was acceptable for young people in my day has changed today. It would have been unthinkable 30 years ago for teenagers to leave home to look for a job, or to move in with a friend of the opposite sex. Children borne out of wedlock used to be shunned by society and orphanages were filled with children from such backgrounds. Society today is more tolerant of such behaviour.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whatever the reason, there are now many children living in family situations where the relationship has not been formalised nor legalised. It is just as common for those relationships to break down as it is for legal relationships. In both cases where families have been established and family homes have been set up, children are involved. I think that is something we have to remember when we are dealing with any part of this Act-that children are involved. The present legislative approach to de facto relationships and the legal consequences of breakdown are messy and it would seem appropriate that any inquiry into family law ought to extend to the question of extension of the Family Court powers to de facto relationships, particularly when there are many anomalies being presented to various courts arising out of property disputes of de facto partners. In fact, sometimes children of two marriages from the same parent are dealt with in different courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this inquiry-I back up Senator Harradine in what he said-may be able to enlighten all of us as to how we can better protect the institution of marriage and ensure the continuity of the family as the basic unit of our society. Marriage has always been the basic unit of our society. Let us hope that the inquiry is able to find out more reasons why certain things to do with the Act or even society are causing so many breakdowns of marriage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of costs associated with divorce is an area that has been repeatedly brought to my attention. It has been included in this inquiry because it is the proper place for such an investigation to occur. I can understand and appreciate the reluctance of my colleague Senator Cooney to take on this additional and specific task in his cost of justice inquiry. I believe that it sits much better in this inquiry as part of the legal costs relating to family law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Harradine has already made some remarks about this inquiry and I know that Senator Spindler will make some as well. Senator Harradine is concerned-he has already mentioned this matter-at the raised expectations in the community as to the ability of this inquiry. That also worries me. Some seem to think that this inquiry will solve all marital problems. Of course it will not; of course it cannot. Because of that many will be disappointed that the part of the Act that affects them most has not had a recommendation to be changed. That should not stop us from trying to make some specific changes to the Act to avert some of the hurt and heartbreak that is occurring now.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am grateful for the support I have been given in this quest. The development of the inquiry is not the result of any one person or any one action, it is the result of many people showing a concern. I believe that as parliamentarians we are here to voice their concerns through the parliamentary system to try to make things just a little better. It is the culmination of many hours work by a great many people by and large working together for a common purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank those who have provided advice, information and assistance in this matter. Particular thanks must go to the staff of Senator Hill and the Hon. Andrew Peacock in the other place more recently who have taken much of the burden, as indeed have staff from probably all our offices. I am quite sure that the staff in Senator Spindler's office will be the same.
       </para>
       <para>
        The work ahead is daunting, but the rewards for many in the community are great if all members of the committee, when they are elected, work on the inquiry with an open mind and a clear conscience. I thank the other members who have spoken tonight on this debate.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am moved to speak tonight in particular to reassure Senator Harradine, who has voiced a number of concerns, in particular, the necessity to address the counselling and mediation which could, and indeed should, be carried out before we proceed to the stage where a couple are facing divorce and an inevitable dissolution of their marriage. I wish to reassure him on that by pointing to the fact that before this inquiry got under way I was able to negotiate with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) some increase in funding for such mediation services, which included family education and marriage education as well as mediation counselling, which is designed to keep a marriage together rather than to let it go to the point of irretrievable breakdown. I was rather sad that I was not able to get more concessions in a number of areas which I sought from the Attorney-General and that, as a result, we felt it necessary to support this particular inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not sorry that it has got to this point. I think it is necessary to acknowledge Senator Brownhill's perseverance over two years to get this inquiry going. He was gracious enough to acknowledge my contribution at the stage when we were looking at the terms of reference. I think proper credit must be given to his untiring efforts. If anyone deserves credit for getting this inquiry off the ground, it is Senator Brownhill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to point out one or two other aspects of the terms of reference which I was able to negotiate with both major parties, which I think go to some of the other concerns that Senator Harradine has mentioned. The recommendations that the Joint Select committee into Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act will make are not limited purely to amendments to the the Family Law Act, but I point out that there is also the phrase `and other action' which could, and should, be taken. I insisted that that was there to ensure that we could look at these mediation and counselling services which are outside the Act, and that we could look at funding questions. It is one thing to have a particular service in place as part either of a court or as part of some other counselling services, but it is quite another to ensure that it can function adequately and has the means to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other area that I was concerned about was actually specifically directed towards the role `of approved organisations providing marriage counselling and family mediation services'. So that area will be well and truly canvassed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one other area which is of some direct personal concern to me; that is, the adversarial nature of our legal system, which in at least two areas-the industrial relations area and the family law area-is misplaced. If there are any areas which require a different approach, they are those two areas. The Committee will, as part of its investigations, have a look at the possibility of reducing the adversarial nature of proceedings in the family law area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Judging by many of the approaches, letters and telephone calls that I have had, and I am that sure Senator Brownhill and others have had, many people feel quite strongly that their particular problems were in many cases exacerbated by the involvement of lawyers. Lawyers who, very often, actually created a dispute or certainly intensified it, were left to their own devices. With different counselling procedures the people concerned might have been able to resolve the difficulties and even heal the relationship much more easily. I think it is an important step forward for this inquiry to be looking at this particular aspect of the Family Court area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other point, already mentioned by Senator Brownhill, was the inclusion of legal costs which, at one stage, some people thought should be included in the cost of the justice inquiry, in which I am also participating but, clearly, costs cannot be separated from the procedures and from the problems that arise in a dispute in the family law area. I think it is appropriate and I am personally very glad that we were able to retain that as part of our terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall not detain the Senate any longer except to make a personal commitment, which I think is shared by the other members of the Committee who will take part in this inquiry, that we will take it extremely seriously and that we will indeed, as Senator Harradine has requested, examine carefully the submissions that people make. I trust that it will not be necessary to exclude any of them from due consideration during the work of this Committee.

         —I want to begin tonight by mentioning another horrible aspect uncovered in the aftermath of the Gulf war, that is, the publication of the discovery of a 60-mile long convoy of Iraqi vehicles bombed on the road to Umm Qasr as they fled out of Kuwait. These people were murdered in retreat. This comes just 10 days after the cease-fire and closely follows the mass destruction of another Iraqi convoy on the road to Basra, causing hundreds, maybe thousands, of deaths.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Pentagon has not released any details about these Iraqi casualties, but I believe it should have enough intelligence on the ground at present to have access to that information. I have no doubt that information about atrocities on both sides is being suppressed, but it strikes me as very hypocritical indeed that the United States (US) now continually talks about the Iraqi war crimes when I believe that all war is a crime against humanity, especially when we have this awful spectacle of hundreds, maybe thousands, of Iraqi soldiers in all kinds of vehicles being shot as they tried to retreat from Kuwait. All war is a crime.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many civilian deaths in Iraq and Kuwait were the direct result of exaggerated claims about Iraq's military capabilities. The military might of the high-tech forces aligned against Iraq was completely disproportionate to the threat. For example, of Iraq's 5,500 tanks, some 3,800 were old Soviet or Chinese types based on 1960s designs, with 1,500 or so of a relatively modern Soviet tank style, the T62s and the T72s. Yet we were consistently fed the line that Iraq had this massive capacity of 5,000 state of the art tanks. According to the US reports, the majority of the Iraqi army were poorly clothed and poorly fed conscripts rather than the crack military forces described before the war began.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition the Iraqi forces lacked night vision, which meant that they had no military capabilities after dark. However, the Pentagon constantly exaggerated the potential of the Iraqi military machine before the war to justify its planned onslaught. After the ground war phase had ended and the coalition's disproportionate firepower had been unleashed, the United States began to acknowledge the limited capabilities of the Iraqi military machine. It is instructive to quote General Norman Schwarzkopf, who denigrated the Iraqi military machine by denigrating Saddam Hussein's leadership abilities:
       </para>
       <para>
        He is neither a strategist nor is he schooled in the operational art nor is he a tactician nor is he a general nor is he a soldier . . . other than that he's a great military man.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet this is the same person whom we were told had this massive military capability and therefore we needed to have this massive amount of military machinery against him to dislodge him from Kuwait. It is very interesting that many books are appearing now about the situation in Iraq. I have spoken here on several occasions about the fact that many countries-about 30 in total-have to take responsibility for the arming of Iraq and for creating this monster that then had to be destroyed. One of the books recently reviewed in the Guardian Weekly is entitled Unholy Babylon by Adel Darwish and Gregory Alexander. To quote just a few lines:

        We have heard that particular incident referred to and of course it is absolutely deplorable, but it is very interesting that now we learn that the former President of the United States was opposed to any criticism of Iraq when that atrocity actually occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another source book on Iraqi civil liberty violations is entitled Human Rights In Iraq from the Middle East Watch. It was first published before Saddam became, in terms that were so convenient to the United States, `a monster'. Factual and well-documented, it allows itself two pages of damning judgment. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Oil earnings have . . . made Iraq a coveted market for the industrialised nations. This substantial economic factor, reinforced by increasingly influential pro-Iraq lobbies, has provided an important incentive to the West to disregard brutal and widespread Iraqi abuses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Iraq was allowed to get away with this kind of behaviour uncriticised. I think the world will have to learn this lesson and will pay bitterly for it in collective terms. Similar judgments about Iraq's violations of human rights over the last decade were provided last month by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in a statement to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which was overlooked in the rush to war in the latter part of 1990. That ICJ statement says:
       </para>
       <para>
        After having perpetrated the most flagrant abuses on its own population without a word of reproach from the UN . . . Iraq must have concluded it could do whatever it pleased.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many questions are raised by these various books, which are coming out now, about the background to the enormous change of heart that was so sudden and, obviously, was so convenient for the military planners who organised this war.
       </para>
       <para>
        Was Saddam Hussein really planning to invade Saudi Arabia or was America's military response just an excuse to cover up a major blunder in US foreign policy? I quote again from the Guardian Weekly of 23 September 1990. This relates to the well-known-but it was not as well-known as it should have been earlier on-25 July conversation between United States Ambassador April Glaspie and Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. Only one week before he ordered his troops into Kuwait, the Iraqi leader warned the US Ambassador in Baghdad that America should not oppose his aims in the Middle East because:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``yours is a society that cannot accept 10,000 dead in one battle'' and is vulnerable to terrorist attack.
       </para>
       <para>
        These statements were according to the Iraqi minutes of that conversation which have not been disputed by the State Department in Washington. Evidently, United States Ambassador Glaspie did not respond directly to Saddam Hussein's menacing comment, concentrating instead on praising Saddam's `extraordinary efforts' to rebuild his country. She also gently probed the Iraqi leader's intentions in massing troops on Kuwait's border but did not criticise the Iraqi troop movements. Iraq's version of the meeting shows Saddam giving Glaspie explicit warnings that he would take whatever action he deemed necessary to stop Kuwait from continuing an economic war against Iraq. Her response, as recorded by the Iraqis but not challenged by the State Department, was to reassure Saddam that the United States took no official position on Iraq's border dispute with Kuwait. She said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreements with Kuwait . . . James Baker has directed our official spokesman to emphasise this instruction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The disclosure of the transcript, which originated with Iraqi officials, appears intended to emphasise that Saddam had reason to believe that the Bush Administration would not offer any serious opposition to his move against Kuwait. They did seem to be surprised when it actually occurred on 2 August. Of course, there is no excuse for the brutality of that invasion or what has happened since then to the Kuwaiti people, for whom I feel a great sympathy, but I think we have not been told the whole story about the lead-up to this devastation. This war, more than anything else, has demonstrated that our world is in crisis, something which eminent scientists, academics and environmentalists have warned about for more than a generation-in fact, ever since World War II.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was the `testing' of the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which was the stimulus for Einstein's famous statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe.
       </para>
       <para>
        But what or how do we need to think? What changes in our values and attitudes are necessary to achieve the changes in behaviour required for our survival? We in the affluent world, who constitute 20 per cent of the world's population and consume 75 per cent of its resources, would obviously need to change our patterns of consumption, for a start.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consumerism would need to become unfashionable, simplicity valued. We would also need to take into account the effects of our present actions on the future. Further, we would need to understand that our survival cannot be at the expense of the quarter of humanity whose most basic needs are not currently met. We would need to re-examine our relationship to nature, to internalise the ecological doctrine and to see ourselves as custodians of nature, not its masters and despoilers. Can we, described by Danish poet Piet Hein as `global citizens with tribunal souls', achieve such radical changes in our thinking?
       </para>
       <para>
        How we have been shaped into what we are and whether we can change our thinking are questions explored in Riane Eisler's challenging book, The Chalice and the Blade. Eisler asks:
       </para>
       <para>
        Is a shift from a system leading to chronic wars, social injustice, and ecological imbalance to one of peace, social justice and ecological balance a realistic possibility?
       </para>
       <para>
        Through a re-examination of our past, weaving together evidence from art, archaeology, religion, social science and history, Eisler argues that a fundamental shift in our direction is possible and is in fact firmly rooted in what actually happened in our past.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am indebted to a great friend and clear thinker, Dr Edna Ross, not only for giving me a copy of this important book but also for her comments about it. Eisler's analysis of our past and present is from the perspective of the relations between the two halves of humanity-male and female. The result is a fascinating and convincing theory of our cultural evolution. This theory of cultural transformation proposes that underlying the surface diversity of human culture are two basic models of society. The dominator model, popularly termed either patriarchy or matriarchy, involves the ranking of one-half of humanity over the other. In the second model, the partnership model, social relations are primarily based on the principle of linking rather than ranking. The fundamental difference in our species, between male and female, is not equated with either inferiority or superiority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cultural transformation theory further proposes that the original direction of our cultural evolution was towards partnership. By examining new archaeological evidence, together with legends, biblical references and historical writings, Eisler creates an intricate tapestry depicting a long period of prosperity and peace during which technologies were developed in societies that were not male dominant, violent or hierarchic. Eisler's documentation suggests that during our prehistory, until the fall of Minoan Crete 3,200 years ago, societies displayed many of the perspectives we now see as necessary for our survival.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, in Neolithic art there is no imagery idealising armed might. Rather, there is a rich array of symbols from nature and a recurring theme of the unity of all things in nature, personified by the goddesses. In Cretan society there was a generally equitable distribution of wealth. This early period, during which our cultural evolution was moving towards partnership, was followed by a period of chaos and almost total cultural disruption when the direction of our cultural revolution was turned around.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is evidence of invasions and of natural catastrophes. The invaders were Indo-Europeans and early Semitic tribes. They shared a dominator model of social organisation in which male dominance, male violence and a hierarchic social structure were the norm.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another commonality that they characteristically acquired was wealth, not by developing technologies of production but through ever more effective technologies of destruction-which of course we have just witnessed yet again in the Gulf war. The title of the book derives from this cataclysmic turning point in the prehistory of Western civilisation. Societies that worship the life generating and nurturing powers of the universe, symbolised by the chalice, were taken over by invaders who worshipped the lethal power of the blade. Unfortunately, it seems as though that is where we still are.
       </para>
       <para>
        Eisler explores this transformation in our history from the perspective of the relations between males and females. She shows how the way we structure this most fundamental of all human relations affects every one of our institutions, our values and the direction of our cultural evolution. By analysing human societies from the perspective that takes account of both men and women, she identifies patterns that characterise dominator or, alternatively, partnership models of social organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        From a conventional perspective, Hitler's Germany, Khomeini's Iran, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the Japan of the Samurai and the Aztecs of Meso America are vastly different societies. Viewed from the perspective of cultural transformation theory, they share the social configuration characteristic of rigidly male dominated societies. They also have in common a generally hierarchic and authoritarian social structure and a high degree of social violence, particularly warfare.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence presented in The Chalice and The Blade shows that behind the oscillating swings of history lie specific conflicts between dominator and partnership values. Periods characterised by increases in the masculine domination over women were periods of increased militarism and imperialism. Periods during which there was an increase in the status of women were characteristically ones of cultural resurgence. Eisler's argument that we have in our prehistory been through a fundamental change in the organisation of our society from a partnership to a dominator model has significance beyond its intrinsic interest. It shows that a fundamental change in how we structure society has occurred and therefore can occur again-which is the encouraging part of the story.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that there happen to be only male senators in the chamber at the moment. I want to state very clearly that this is not a go at male society as it is at the moment; it is a part of a cultural conditioning which has got us into the situation in which we are. This is no bid for a complete transfer of power into another dominator kind of society, the matriarchy, which has been practised in some civilisations in the past. What I am talking about is a partnership model rather than a dominator model of either sex over the other.
       </para>
       <para>
        The transformation from a partnership to a dominator type of organisation required fundamental changes in thinking, since what is considered normal and right under the two types of social organisation are poles apart. The way in which the required transformation of values and norms-that is, of minds-was brought about constitutes the second theme of Eisler's book. An intriguing tale of a monumental cover-up unfolds. If we accept that the replication of ideas is essential in forming and then maintaining social systems, then replacing a partnership social organisation with one based on force-backed domination required that changes in replicative information be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process whereby the human mind was remoulded, which went on for millennia, entailed all the instruments of socialisation. One of the most important of these instruments was the spiritual education carried out by the ancient priesthoods. Eisler's documentation of the rewriting of our myths and sacred stories illustrates the way in which the constant refashioning of normative oral and written literature was an integral part of the process of norm changing through which a hierarchical society gradually began to be seen not only as normal but also as right.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cumulative effect of this chronicle is disturbing at many levels. The suppression of information, which was seen as threatening to the new system, and the efforts of intellectuals to make reality conform to a dominator world view illustrates both the lengths to which those in power went to protect and entrench their position and the power of the replication of ideas in determining reality. Why do we not question how a righteous God could order his soldiers to commit acts of gross inhumanity towards their fellow human beings as we have seen so recently?

       <para>
        Equally shocking is the demonstration of how our sacred texts function to maintain the boundaries that keep us imprisoned in a dominator system and, at a personal level, the realisation of the enormous toll of 5,000 years of conditioning on one's ability to think freely. Who has considered the implications of the biblical account of procreation in which endless lists of men begat other men and never a woman was mentioned, not to state the implications of women having been derived from man's rib as an afterthought, and the fall of grace initiated by Eve eating from the tree of knowledge?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is impossible to do justice to Eisler's account in a short time such as this since it is the cumulative effect of the examples she uses that gives her argument its power. But what are the implications for the present and the future of the information presented in the Chalice and the Blade? Eisler's analysis of our history and pre-history shows that in the early days of civilisation our cultural evolution was truncated and then completely turned around. The evidence for the existence of a society organised on a partnership basis, and the associated cultural and technological evolution of such a society, suggests that it is not human nature but the organisation of a society which determines the direction of its evolution. It also shows how the old roots of civilisation were never eradicated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Throughout our history there have been periods where values consistent with a partnership system have gained prominence. All modern, post-enlightenment movements for social justice as well as the more recent feminist peace and ecology movements are part of an underlying thrust for the transformation of a dominator system to a partnership system. However, it is only feminism which explicitly addresses the fact that underlying the problems on which these movements focus is a male dominator, female dominated model of the human species. It is only feminism which explicitly recognises that the way a society structures the most fundamental of human relations profoundly affects all aspects of living and thinking.
       </para>
       <para>
        The world view which various scholars have identified as being necessary for our survival is consistent with the partnership model of society and the values of feminism. It is not consistent with the values embodied in a dominator society. For this reason, feminism could become the nucleus for a consistent ideology required to replace the dominator with a partnership society. Under a dominator model of social organisation, the crises that our planet faces today are insoluble.
       </para>
       <para>
        Eisler shows that the most urgent problems require solutions which change the status and role of women. For example, present policies have failed to slow down significantly the population explosion. For population planning to succeed it is necessary to give top priority to reproductive freedom and equality for women and to create satisfying, socially rewarding roles for women other than those of wives and mothers, although that is not to denigrate the position of wives and mothers-far from it.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are women's issues. They are not given top priority. Human evolution is now at a crossroads. There have been significant changes in the relationships between men and women over the past 20 years. Feminine values are increasingly seen as desirable, even amongst men. This is indeed encouraging. Even Rod Cameron has talked about the feminisation of Australian politics-a welcome change, if indeed he is right. The gains of the women's movement have posed the strongest challenge to male supremacy in thousands of years, and the increase in Christian and Islamic fundamentalism is seen by Eisler as a response to this perceived threat of the ascendancy of feminisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Probably the most significant changes in the relationship between males and females have been within the family. The argument and evidence presented in the Chalice and the Blade that a partnership society offers a viable alternative future are convincing. But how do we get from here to there? It is in answering this question that the book is probably at its weakest. Eisler argues that humans have the ability to choose their own evolutionary path and that, since our actions are determined by ideas and the way we conceive possibilities, it is how we will view reality, what is possible and desirable, which will determine our future.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Chalice and the Blade presents a comprehensive and challenging perspective of our social evolution. It is a big book, not in its bulk but in its provision of a new way of looking at ourselves. It presents a strong argument for the proposition that the achievement of the goals of feminism may provide a social organisation which will address the crises we now face; for the view that feminism is not just good for women but essential for us all.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe this ghastly war, in which Australia participated so enthusiastically at the behest of the United States but not without vigorous, if unpopular, dissent in this country, will be the last hurrah of the militarists. I sincerely hope so. It seems that the dominators needed to reassert their authority when faced with the evidence that the feminisation of culture was on the ascendancy. So they have used their destructive technology with devastating effect. The whole truth of the horrors may never be known. What we do know should provide a signal lesson that humanity cannot continue with the dominator, destructive, exploitative behaviour which results in human and environmental losses on a massive scale. A new path, perhaps the partnership model put forward by Riane Eisler, must be found.

        Senator Harradine, Senator Brownhill and Senator Spindler spoke of the setting up of a joint select committee to inquire into certain aspects of the operations and interpretation of the Family Law Act. I believe that Senator Brownhill is to be commended for his persistence in putting forward this particular proposal, responding as he has to many requests from throughout the Australian community that matters of concern and, indeed, of real anguish be taken up concerning the operation of the Family Law Act. Had it not been for his persistence, firstly in this chamber and then in consultation with the Attorney-General, Mr Michael Duffy, in order to gather the support of the House of Representatives and therefore to enable the setting up of the joint committee, we would not be in a position now where the Parliament can undertake the review which I believe most honourable members and senators would, from their own experience in their electorate offices, concede ought to be undertaken.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Poaching in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has been a problem in the past. The high level of surveillance effort undertaken in recent years has drastically reduced the number of infringements detected in the Marine Park. The surveillance program uses information sourced from several elements including:
      </para>
      <para>
       * Coastwatch aircraft;
      </para>
      <para>
       * Queensland National Parks and Wildlife surveillance aircraft;
      </para>
      <para>
       * RAAF Orion patrols of the Australian Fishing Zone;
      </para>
      <para>
       * RAN Patrol Boat surveillance vessels; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * Regular patrols by the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service, Queensland Water Police and Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol (who are responsible for the day-to-day management of the Marine Park).
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia also cooperates with foreign governments in trying to discourage incursions into the Australian Fishing Zone. These programs aim to make foreign fishermen aware of the penalties for illegal fishing in Australian waters and the likelihood of apprehension.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) It is very difficult to directly attribute specific instances where damage has been caused to the reef by the illegal activities of poachers. There are however exceptions where vessels become grounded on the reef and are subsequently found to have been engaged in illegal activities. Detected instances of this are rare.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is not possible to provide accurate estimates of the marine life removed by illegal fishing. The poaching of clam meat was a significant problem up to the late 1970s but all evidence indicates that the level of poaching activity is now very low. Untended drift nets which continue to indiscriminately trap marine life do represent a problem.

        —The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Reports from the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) and industry indicate that, while international travel was severely disrupted during the conflict, and there was a significant impact on some sectors of Australia's tourism industry, Australia was relatively less affected than other major travel destinations. This in part reflected the perception by many that Australia was relatively safe, and well removed from the war. As a result some travellers decided to revise their plans and visit Australia in preference to their original destinations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The end of the Gulf War will greatly reduce the level of uncertainty being faced by the tourism industry. It should lead to a return to more normal international travel patterns and a more favourable climate for the ATC's marketing program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) During the period of the Gulf War the Government closely monitored market developments with the assistance of the ATC. Market assessments have been regularly updated by the ATC in conjunction with the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia (ITOA) and the Australian Tourism Industry Association (ATIA), to ensure that the timing and scope of promotional activities were appropriate to developments in major source countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       Special meetings were also held with State and Territory tourism ministers and the Tourism Advisory Council to exchange views on the effects of, and discuss strategies in response to, the Gulf situation to minimise the adverse effects on tourism to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       No Government financial assistance was specifically allocated as a result of the Gulf crisis. The decision in December by the Government to boost promotional funding for the ATC by $23 million has helped to ensure that Australia continues to actively promote itself in our target markets. International promotion and marketing by the ATC, including a new campaign in North America, Japan and Asia featuring Greg Norman, is to be launched by the middle of the year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) &amp;(4) There is little doubt that some tourism operators experienced disruptions during the Gulf War although the net effect on business and tourism employment, particularly over the longer term, will be hard to quantify.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the reasons outlined in (1) above, Australia's tourism industry has been relatively less affected, particularly when compared to other international travel destinations. It is likely that some potential visitors lost initially due to the war may now be regained.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. The International Criminal Police Organisation (ICPO), commonly known as Interpol, has never asked the Australian Government to set up any kind of base in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1948 Australia applied to Interpol to establish a National Central Bureau (NCB) in Australia, and was accepted.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the 59th General Assembly of Interpol in Ottawa last year, Interpol delegates accepted Australia's offer for its NCB to be the Regional Communications Centre for Interpol in the South Pacific. Communications traffic to and from member countries in the South Pacific will now be channelled through Canberra. Strict confidentiality will be maintained by the NCB in its handling of the messages received and transmitted, in that hard copies of the messages will not be retained unless the message involves Australia. The Communications Centre will not require the allocation of any additional equipment or resources to the NCB.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. Firstly Interpol does not have ``host'' governments: it is made up of 154 member countries throughout the world. Its headquarters is at Lyon in France and each member country has an established link with Interpol Headquarters known as an NCB.
      </para>
      <para>
       Responsibility for the control, operation and administration of an NCB rests with the member country. The staff and equipment in a country's NCB are subject to the laws of that country. Interpol does not require immunity from intervention or enquiry for its staff and equipment because it does not have staff or equipment in member countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       Within Australia the NCB is administered by the Commissioner of the AFP and the personnel who work in the NCB are AFP personnel. The Australian NCB operates strictly within Australian law, including for example the Privacy Act, and its staff are subject to Australian criminal, civil and administrative laws. Additionally its staff are subject to the AFP disciplinary provisions including the overseeing of complaints by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
      </para>
      <para>
       While there is an agreement that individual staff assigned to NCBs in France, Argentina &amp;Thailand cannot be sued, an NCB in any country can be sued through the member country's government according to the laws of that country, for example in Australia through the Commissioner of the AFP.
