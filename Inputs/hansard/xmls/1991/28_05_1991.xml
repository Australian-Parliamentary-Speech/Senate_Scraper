        <para in-line="1">
         —Since the resignation and flight of President Mengistu last week, fighting in the north and north-west of the country has seen significant gains made by the various rebel groups in Eritrea. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front has at last captured Asmara and the strategic port of Assab while the Tigrean People's Liberation Front has now surrounded the capital, Addis Ababa.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The prospects for a peaceful settlement now rest with the round table meeting, which began in London yesterday, between the Government and rebel groups. There have been very recent reports, not yet confirmed, that a cease-fire has in fact been agreed upon at the conference.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Government has long supported and called for a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Ethiopia. We have made this very clear to the Ethiopian Government and to the various rebel groups. We are certainly hopeful that the London talks will see the end of a conflict which has gone on for 30 years and which has contributed so much to the tragedy of Ethiopia during that period.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the second part of the question, the bulk of the Australian Government's humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, which has totalled $11.4m this financial year, has been channelled through Australian non-government organisations working with local relief agencies. The Australian NGOs are: Community Aid Abroad (CAA); Australian Freedom From Hunger Campaign; Australian Catholic Relief; Australian Council of Churches; World Vision Australia; Austcare and the Lutheran World Service.
       </para>
       <para>
        All agencies-and I understand that this is true of the other international ones as well-advise that their operations are continuing, albeit after making appropriate alterations to their programs in keeping with the changing situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        While a media report has suggested that Community Aid Abroad is concerned about two of its employees, of whom it has not heard since the weekend, CAA has assured the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau that there is no reason to fear for their safety.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the last part of Senator Schacht's question, there have been reports that a plebiscite or referendum under international supervision will be held to determine the future relationship between Eritrea and the rest of the country. That is certainly something that the Eritreans have been seeking for a long time. The Australian Government's view on that is essentially that this is a question for the Ethiopian people to decide and we will respect any decision made as the end result of a genuinely democratic process.

Can the Minister inform the Senate whether his idea of social justice includes spending over $2,000 for a two-night stay in a London hotel; almost $4,500 on a three-day chauffeur-driven limousine trip around the west coast of Ireland; and a $630 bill for food, drink and other living expenses for one night in Hong Kong-all this at the same time as almost 40,000 Australians joined the dole queues in January?

The reason that these newspapers showed such interest in this event is that Senator Alston issued a press release and sent it out to them.

But Senator Alston in his press release did not tell the whole truth, which I shall do now.

       <para>
        Senator Alston asked some specific questions and I will answer those first and then seek to give a more general answer. I have not yet received the bill for a two-night stay in a hotel in London. I have received no bills at all for the January trip or for the April trip, and it was only last week that I received bills for the trip in September. The reason for that is that it always takes some time for these things to come through.

        As for the $2,000 bill, I stayed in exactly the same room on a previous trip and the cost was less than $500 a night, so when I receive these bills-and I am sure that will happen soon-I will seek to find out why I have been charged more for the same room. If there is not a good enough reason for being charged more, quite obviously I will seek some recompense from the hotel concerned.

         —Let me get this out so that it is exact. On the first and second trips-the second trip was the Ireland one-I was accompanied by my wife and by a staff member. As well as that, the Secretary of my Department, his wife and a senior departmental official were on both of those trips. So there were six people-not just me-and it is very hard to fit six people into one car, especially when they are as big as some of the people who were on this trip are. We did not have one car, we had two. I do not think I will ever be able to provide a breakdown to honourable senators as to who was in what car at what time. I do not think we have kept a record of that, so that is something Opposition senators will have to learn to live without.

        In so far as the one bill for food quoted at $630 is concerned-which was not for one day but for two, but that does not matter; I concede it is still a lot of money-the ridiculous part of this is that I have not had any opportunity to go through any of these bills to see what it is appropriate that I return to the taxpayer. I will. I have not yet and I will not for some time because, as I have explained, I have not even received them. But I will go through them and, at the end, I will see what I should pay back and will do so. It must be noted, of course, that whenever any Minister stays in a hotel the bills are picked up by the embassies. The embassies send the bills back to Australia later. The Ministers go through the bills and, where the Ministers consider it appropriate to send money back, we do-and I shall.
       </para>
       <para>
        In so far as what was left out this morning is concerned, if we are looking at the bottom line for trips, I would have thought that signing an agreement with the Netherlands Government in January which saves Australia $7m a year was worth the $50,000 spent on the trip. If I can do that for every trip I go on, then I think the Australian taxpayer will be well served indeed. I might say that as far as the last trip is concerned, it was even better because whereas Germany had stalled on negotiations with us and refused to continue, I got the agreement of the German Government not just to continue but to conclude an agreement within 12 months, which will save Australia $20m a year and will bring into the country $60m a year. So that is what I was doing there and I am glad I went.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only problem with the second and third trips, frankly, is that Saddam Hussein got in the road and made it two instead of one. I was to visit Germany and Portugal on the last trip but could not do so because there was a war and the Parliament was recalled. I think all honourable senators will remember coming back from wherever they were in January. I was in Italy and I came back from Italy when the Parliament was recalled and could not continue on to Germany.

I visited a hospital which was set up with Australian money, and I visited an old persons home which we had renovated with Australian money. I had been requested to do so for a long, long time and I finally got there. As to whether that is a bad thing or not, Senator Alston can ask those in the Italian community; I will leave it up to them, but I have not had any complaints about the fact that I went and saw where millions of Australian dollars had been spent.

        I did not get to Germany and Portugal. That meant, of course, that instead of the domestic air fares within Europe to get to those countries, I came back to Australia and then had to spend the money to go back. Not to pursue with countries like Germany those agreements that will save millions of dollars for Australia would mean I was not doing my job. I will always do it. I went back and did it and, I might say, given the progress with Austria, I might have to go back there as well because it will save Australia a few more millions. I will do it every single time. But Senator Alston did not include that in his press release-he never does. He only tells half the story and, as always, the half story is wrong anyway.

         —I saw a letter from Mr Ian Spicer in the Australian Financial Review last week, to which I have replied-just so the record is kept straight. Mr Spicer has made allegations of that sort directly to me. It is appropriate that the record be set straight. I think Mr Spicer knows better. He is a qualified lawyer in his own right-he understands the industrial law-and would understand that the allegations he has made are not true. It seems that it is part of a public debate in which there is an interest in confusing or bluffing people with legal jargon.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Essentially, there have been three assertions made: that the Government, by not accepting the Industrial Relations Commission's wage case decision, has established a precedent which implies that any decision of the IRC can be rejected; that it follows that employers could, with impunity, ignore awards if employers do not agree with the IRC decisions; and that the Government is acting unconstitutionally by attempting to fix wages. All of those allegations are incorrect.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation is that the Government did criticise-and we do not resile from it-the national wage case decision. We endorsed the institution of the Industrial Relations Commission and reaffirmed its role; but we reserve the right to criticise this decision, which does not endorse the accord. The Industrial Relations Commission's decision in national wage cases is not a decision from which an order of the Commission emanates; that is, an order making or varying an award and thus creating law. With the order, the Industrial Relations Commission issues a new law. That law must be obeyed by the parties bound by it. This Government obeys all such laws and advices and counsels employers and workers to do likewise.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the national wage case, the IRC made a decision; it did not issue an order. It issued an invitation to unions to apply for a 2.5 per cent wage increase on the basis that they give a voluntary commitment to continue award restructuring, to file no further claims, and to produce further productivity changes in industry for an open-ended period. To my knowledge, only three unions have applied. Those are the Northern Territory Senior Police Officers Association, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Senior Executive Staff Officers Association, and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. All those unions cover senior executives or highly paid personnel and would benefit more from a 2.5 per cent variation to their rates of pay than a $12 flat increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision was made some six weeks ago and no other unions, to my knowledge, have applied. Instead, they have sought to negotiate directly with employers. The Australian Government has entered those negotiations and concluded an agreement which it would like the Commission, at some stage, to vary our awards for but which we will observe. In that case, if we do, there is no unconstitutional act applying. If the allegation that Mr Spicer is making is that we have not applied to impose the 2.5 per cent increase, the allegation can equally be made to all the members of Mr Spicer's organisation-the CAI-which has, likewise, not applied for the Commission's decision to be entered into awards. The CAI may not have done that for exactly the same reason as the Government-that is, this is still a free society: one cannot compel an independent party to give a voluntary commitment to observe a set of criteria, which the national wage case decision in this case required it to do. Thus it is that no major employer organisation in this country has applied to impose a 2.5 per cent wage increase on its employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final point I make in regard to whether the Government is acting unconstitutionally is that, clearly, that is a ridiculous assertion. If we are doing so, I invite Mr Spicer to take legal action against us. The fact that he has not and continues to make the allegation suggests that I am right and that there is no legal case. Of course, there is not. The allegation seems to be that we negotiated with our own work force-which is the privilege of any employer. If that is the allegation, the Government is guilty and I am pleased to be guilty of that. We have now reached an arrangement with our work force for a wages and productivity package to be struck, which means that wages in Australian government employment can rise but the costs of delivering the services that the Australian public sector provides can be reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        That seems to me to be the total essence of productivity bargaining. That is an outcome that is devoutly to be wished for in the private sector as well. I think these allegations should be seen for what they are: an attempt at point-scoring and bluster, rather than any real legal analysis.

         —Included in Senator Coulter's question are a number of assumptions that I will dispute, but it will be necessary to get some more information to him. I can answer the questions in part. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories approved the Army conducting a logistics exercise named Termite Spray 91 at Murrays Beach in the Jervis Bay Territory during May of this year, subject to the Army complying with strict conditions protecting the environment, health and safety. The ACT Parks and Conservation Bureau is under contract to the Minister's Department to provide land management services in the Jervis Bay Territory. The Bureau's views were included in the Department's advice to the Minister and were considered in reaching the decision to approve the Army exercise in the Territory. The Bureau was closely involved in formulating the conditions which were agreed to by the Army concerning the conduct of the Murrays Beach operation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Because of the strict conditions agreed to by the Army, because there was adequate access to the beach via an existing fire trail, because no new works or vegetation removal were required, and because there was no expectation of significant impact on the environment, action under the Australian Heritage Commission Act was not required, although regard was had to some of its provisions. Activities at Murrays Beach were closely monitored by the Department and its land management agent, the ACT Parks and Conservation Bureau.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contrary to reports in the media, there were no more than 20 soldiers in the Murrays Beach area at any one time, nor were tanks involved or tracks hacked through the bush. But because of heavy rain, the Army was required by the Department to conclude the exercise at Murrays Beach about six hours early. The exercise finished at about 6 p.m. on 23 May without apparent significant impact on the environment. In accordance with its undertaking, the Army will level the surface of the fire trail as soon as the weather permits. Overall, the trail will be in better condition than it was before the Army exercise.

         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. Is the Minister aware of widespread problems experienced by voters at the New South Wales general election held last Saturday, resulting in the recording of informal votes which, at times, approached 18 per cent of those cast in some seats and totalled some 250,000 votes overall? Will the Minister seek a report from the Australian Electoral Commission on the nature of the problems encountered so as to avoid a repetition of this appalling situation at a national level?

         —When any election is held around Australia, it is the normal practice for members of the Australian Electoral Commission, including from interstate, to go in as observers so that they can examine how the election is run, learn from any mistakes and also learn from any innovations that could be applied in their own State. I am quite sure that the Australian Electoral Commission would have been involved as an observer in every aspect of the New South Wales election.

        It is true that the informal vote in some electorates reached fairly remarkable heights-I think 20 per cent in two electorates. Almost certainly, this comes down to the fact that the Electoral Act was changed in New South Wales, I think, last November. If there is one thing that has come through to anyone who studies electoral systems, it is that if a system is changed a much higher informal vote is likely at the next poll.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1984, we learned that changing the Senate electoral system to requiring a `1' for a group vote had quite a substantial impact on the House of Representatives. It did not change the result in one seat, but it added to the informal vote. The conclusion we can draw is that if we continually change voting systems the informal vote will remain high.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a bit of a tradition in New South Wales of changing voting systems according to the self-interest of parties. There is no doubt that ticks and crosses were eliminated in November last year to help the coalition. The reduction in the number of seats and a redistribution were for the same reason. It was all supposed to add to the overwhelming return of the Greiner Government and the start of the Liberal resurgence in Australia. Well, it is back to the drawing board there.
       </para>
       <para>
        In answer to Senator Loosley, I do not know whether we at the Federal level have to draw conclusions, other than that we should not be constantly tampering with the voting system and that we must be very conscious before each election of trying to sell how to vote formally. The philosophy of the Australian Electoral Commission adopted in 1983-easy to enrol, easy to vote-has stood us in very good stead. Honourable senators will note that in the 1987 and 1990 Federal elections informal votes were basically on the decline.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know that anything can be done about the matter, other than to regret the fact that 250,000 citizens-probably 7 or 8 per cent of those entitled to vote-did not have their vote recorded properly on Saturday and at least half, and probably more, inadvertently voted informally. One must concede that there are always a few per cent of people who will vote informally deliberately. However, all that allowing ticks and crosses-or ticks, in particular-for two out of the three ballots, and denying it in the other, leads to is confusion and disfranchisement.

Is the Minister also aware that in provincial towns the situation is even more desperate, with people arriving in the towns looking for work, having spent all their money to get there, and then finding that they have no work, no money and nowhere to live? I also refer the Minister to comments made by the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, that this was mostly a Commonwealth responsibility. As current programs for rural assistance focus more on those who still have farms, what forms of emergency measures can the Government provide in the guise of emergency housing or other such assistance to help these desperate workers?

        I have been asked about complaints in the Brisbane Courier-Mail that finding accommodation is very difficult for those moving into the cities or provincial towns as a result of the recession and, of course, the rural downturn. The rural downturn has causes which go way beyond those of the recession. I am not certain what Mr Kerin's view is as to how long it might last but, clearly, while it does there will be severe inconvenience.

       <para>
        The Commonwealth has not been in the business of providing emergency housing. That has always been a matter for the States. The Federal Government has, however, through a number of programs, funded the States to provide that housing. At the moment, Minister Howe has under way a complete review of the housing strategy in Australia and, as I understand it, he will be putting up to Cabinet a range of new measures in the Budget discussions this year. I am not yet certain how far they will go towards easing this problem. Clearly, we have to reach a situation where the Commonwealth and the States stop arguing about who is responsible-not just for the people to whom Senator Bjelke-Petersen referred, but also homeless kids and others-and make sure that someone is responsible and that that responsibility is lived up to.
       </para>

        I am not sure that either the States or the Commonwealth have ever lived up to their responsibilities in relation to accommodation for the poor and the disadvantaged before. I hope that, as a result of the initiatives we are taking in the Budget this time and with the States, by November we will at least be able to sort out the mess and start providing the accommodation that we always should have provided, at both State and Commonwealth levels.

He made the accusation that there is a proliferation of politicians in or out of uniform in the corridors of Russell Hill. That comes as news to me and I must say that, in my dealings with those in the upper echelon of the ADF, I have found that their political views are their own and they are never discussed with me, nor do I wish to know their voting patterns or, indeed, their political preference. It has to be a commitment, I believe, to the best interests of the Australian Defence Force on which appointments in the Australian Defence Force are based.

I am trying to find a non-tripper in this chamber. Is there one? Yes, Senator Kernot. Senator Bourne should not put her hand up; she is going to Tibet. Poor old Senator Herron has missed out in the party room. The rest are as guilty as anyone else of liking some travel. But it is for what purpose? Most people in this chamber travel for a good purpose-to broaden their education, to see how systems work overseas and to bring back those advantages. I am one who encourages senior officers of the Defence Force to visit their counterparts in this region and to develop a degree of military transparency so that trust will follow.

I believe as money is cheaper to them they should pass on the benefit of that low interest rate money to their customers, but not simply to home buyers. As far as I am concerned, good luck to those who have had the advantage of reductions in their mortgage repayments, but many hundreds of thousands of Australians who use credit cards have not had the benefit of a reduction in interest rates and I am quite sure that they are entitled to that reduction. Despite protestations to the contrary from the bankers' spokesmen, the fact is that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia has managed to signal its intention to reduce its Bankcard rate by, I think, 1.6 per cent in early July. So there is room for a downward movement in interest rates on credit cards and I believe the other banks ought to pass on the benefit of those reduced rates to their various customers. I certainly challenge them to do the same.

        The Australian Bankers Association has claimed that this is an unprofitable part of a bank's operations. It says that about one-third of the users of credit cards do not pay interest because they have the hide, apparently, to repay the amount that is indicated on their account within the timeframe set. But the Bankers Association spokespeople never mention that the retailers, restaurateurs, motel owners and hotel operators all pay a merchant fee to the banks and that the banks certainly get revenue from all those transactions from the merchants who use this credit card facility. That is never mentioned by the banks concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe there is room for the banks to pass on the benefit of lower interest rates. If they do not, certainly consumers and customers should use their power in the market place to shop around and treat the credit cards in the same way as they do when they make a purchase at Woolworths Ltd, K Mart, David Jones (Aust) Pty Ltd, or Myer Stores Ltd, and get the benefit of a bank or financial institution which provides credit card facilities at the lower end of the scale of interest rates. In other words, they should use their power in the market place in regard to this financial product as they do when they shop for other products.

I might add that, from recent public opinion polling, if we can place any weight on that-and as a result of the New South Wales election, I think we have to be a little circumspect about doing that-we can see that opinions in the community at large are well divided on this issue, as well as opinions within the ranks of the Government and, indeed, I am sure, the ranks of the Opposition. The Cabinet will be debating this issue, I think on Thursday, and I will be there.

I refer the Minister to the agreed upon restructuring process within the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which identified staff cuts of 27 per cent to airworthiness surveyors as the minimum level agreed to by all parties to maintain adequate airworthiness checks. Is it true that, under the new management, the number of airworthiness surveyors is about to be reduced by a further cut of up to 55 per cent? Can the Minister confirm that there will be enough airworthiness officers and resources to carry out full safety surveillance of aircraft, especially when we consider that lack of airworthiness accounts for 28 per cent of all plane crashes and when both the number of planes in use and the number of air fatalities in general aviation are on the increase in Australia?

       <para>
        Significant changes are being contemplated in the CAA which have significant ramifications for staff with no diminution at all to the safety aspects. The CAA is moving, with my full support, to a position where the management of Australian air space will be overhauled and brought more closely into line with international practice and where the air traffic control systems that we operate in this country will be brought up to date by utilising the technology that is now available and by reducing the number of centres that provide air traffic control.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia, we are still in the absurd position of having air traffic control sectors which are modelled on State boundaries, for no good reason other than that they are modelled on State boundaries. If the air traffic control system goes ahead as it is currently proposed-indeed, I think it will be amended; it will not go ahead as currently proposed-over a period of five years, it will not only produce an air traffic control system which is safer but also require something in excess of 1,000 fewer people to operate. Clearly, that will have ramifications for the staff of the CAA.

         —Aircraft never did. I have not yet had an opportunity of reading the coroner's report, although I am well aware of what the report said. I do intend to read the coroner's findings in full when I get the opportunity to do so. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has probably established some world class initiatives in the investigation of the unfortunate accidents involving this particular type of aircraft. The investigations that have been completed to this point in time related to the tendency of this type of aircraft to be subject to icing at particular altitudes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In fact, for some significant time the aircraft have been restricted in Australia to freight operations only, without being able to carry passengers. At this stage it is fair to say that one of the reasons why this type of aircraft is so prevalent in this country is that they were regarded as high performance aircraft and they were on sale in Australia at prices that were extremely cheap, which made them attractive to companies to buy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the safety authorities in Australia not only reacted promptly and properly in the investigation of these accidents, but also the research that was carried out by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) probably created a world first in the investigation of this particular kind of accident.
       </para>
       <para>
        On one of the very early visits that I made to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation I listened to some of the voice tapes from the cockpit voice recorders that the Bureau holds-and some of them are extremely difficult to listen to. One of them contained the voice cockpit recording of an ex-BASI employee who was himself at the controls of one of these aircraft and recorded his last messages as the aircraft was going in, relaying information over the cockpit voice recorder that he clearly thought would be of use to the accident investigators, which it subsequently was.

       Mr President, the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was a despicable and senseless act of violence. It was a tragedy for India and for its people. It must not become also a tragedy for India's political process. I hope that all Australians, including every member of this chamber, will join me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at his untimely death.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Gandhi assumed the reins of power and the responsibilities of national leadership at a relatively young age and under very difficult circumstances. He accepted the challenge with courage, commitment and a sense of duty that was truly admirable. As Prime Minister, Mr Gandhi set about reforming, modernising and consolidating development in his country of some 800 million people. He was an innovator, introducing many policies designed to equip India to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
      </para>
      <para>
       His insights and cooperation on international issues, particularly on such difficult questions as South Africa, were of enduring value. Everyone who met him in the Commonwealth found him tenacious and constructive as well as a man of considerable personal charm. In regional and international affairs, Mr Gandhi sought a responsible and measured role for India. He attempted to forge closer relations with Pakistan, and he was the first Indian leader to visit China since the 1950s.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's long-standing friendship with India was strengthened considerably during Rajiv Gandhi's prime ministership. He was personally committed to maintaining a strong relationship with us. As recently as last month, Rajiv Gandhi spoke with a member of this Parliament, Senator Graham Maguire, of his desire for closer ties between our two countries. It is true that our economic ties have never been as close as they should be or could be. That is all the more reason why we should mourn the loss of one such as Rajiv Gandhi, committed as he was to strengthening those ties. Honourable senators will recall Prime Minister Gandhi's visit to Australia in 1988 when there was a series of discussions about the strengthening of economic ties between the two countries, which were followed up in subsequent discussions and exchanges between governments, industry and other personnel.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, Rajiv Gandhi's contribution to India's democracy and parliamentary government followed the strong tradition set by his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru who was a founder of independent India and its first Prime Minister, and his mother, Indira Gandhi. During the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to India in 1989, he delivered the Third Indira Gandhi Memorial Lecture. That evening was chaired by Rajiv Gandhi. In his concluding comments on that occasion, he spoke movingly of his mother and of her admiration for Australia, and described the new recognition, the new understanding and the sense of common purpose which make India and Australia partners in the great tasks ahead. He said that he looked forward to building, in partnership with Australians, a new era in Indo-Australian relations. For any democracy to lose two leaders of the stature of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi is to suffer a doubly grievous blow. However, we have confidence that India is resilient enough to overcome this loss and to endure this provocation.
      </para>
      <para>
       On a personal note-I am sure other colleagues, particularly my colleague Senator Evans, will have more to say about this-on the occasions of my two meetings with Rajiv Gandhi, the last time in India, I can add nothing to the widespread opinion of his personal charm and engaging nature, except that, to me, he was a person of lively intellectual curiosity with a great enthusiasm for ideas. That is exciting to see in anyone in politics, particularly when one looks around here. That was a very attractive quality in the former Prime Minister.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have all been robbed of the greater contribution that this man, still relatively young, could have made to his nation and to the world.

Rajiv Gandhi's tragic assassination, at the age of 46, deprived India of a political leader committed to democratic government and the well-being of his nation, a leader who still had much of his national and international career before him.

       Unfortunately, tragedy of this nature has dogged the Indian nation and was a potential danger-a danger of which Mr Gandhi was well aware-throughout his political career. The assassination of Indira Gandhi, which led to Rajiv Gandhi's election as Prime Minister in 1984, was not the first such example. It is to be hoped that Mr Gandhi's death does not signal the start of another spiral of violence between the diverse groups in India. Indeed, we commend the people of India for their courage and determination to avoid any such additional tragedy in this time of national grief.

       Rajiv Gandhi came from a family with a long and proud heritage. He assumed leadership of the Congress (I) Party, and of India, with an unwavering commitment to his country, characteristic of his grandfather, Nehru, and his mother. From having little direct participation in politics prior to his mother's assassination, Rajiv Gandhi became a respected politician of national and international stature.

One aspect of this achievement which I would particularly like to note was his contribution to constructive internationalism which saw India playing a greater role in world affairs. I mention particularly his leadership role in the non-aligned movement-NAM-which was assumed under his leadership of India, and also the prominent role India continued to play in the Commonwealth under his leadership. That led him to a number of issues, one of which was South Africa, as mentioned by Senator Button, in relation to the contribution of his country in the Commonwealth. Also, he contributed to such difficult issues as the North-South divide to try to overcome these international divisions. At home, Mr Gandhi implemented a program of economic reform-perhaps not as well known-whilst he was Prime Minister, attempting to reduce dependence on nationalised industry and implement greater free market economic policies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, in the middle of national elections, can only be a setback to hopes for the stabilisation of India and the implementation of economic reforms. Mr Gandhi was widely seen as having had the necessary national stature to deal with these problems should he have been given the people's mandate. The determination of the Indian people to remain committed to a stable and democratic environment has been tried many times over the years without really faltering. I am confident that this strength of resolve shown in the quest for peaceful government will once again help India face its current crisis and successfully withstand these challenges to stability and democracy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rajiv Gandhi was a committed political leader whose untimely and violent death is a great loss for India and for the Commonwealth. On behalf of the Opposition, I extend to his widow and children our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

       In the past India has justifiably prided itself on the creed of non-violence espoused by Mahatma Gandhi, which was one of the key elements in its achieving independence from Britain in 1947. Rajiv Gandhi was three years old when that independence was achieved and his grandfather, Mr Nehru, became India's first Prime Minister. Mr Gandhi's mother, Mrs Indira Gandhi, was murdered while Prime Minister of India in 1984. Mr Gandhi, as we all know, was murdered a few days ago at an election rally.

       Rajiv Gandhi's family has suffered profoundly at the hands of that special breed of lunatic who believes that murder may be justified. Murder cannot be justified. No cause gains any sympathy by killing an innocent person. Mahatma Gandhi once said:

        —On behalf of the National Party of Australia, I join the Senate in expressing deep regret at the untimely death of Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of India. Rajiv Gandhi came from a remarkable family in the political history of modern India, which dominated both the Indian political scene and the Congress Party over the past 40 years. The grandson of Nehru, the founding Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi followed his mother, Indira Gandhi, as Prime Minister of India after her tragic assassination in 1984. Serving as Prime Minister from 1984 to 1989, Rajiv Gandhi became the third generation of his family to hold the position of Prime Minister of India.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       India is the world's second most populous country, consisting of 880 million people, and the world's most populous democracy. Rajiv Gandhi was widely tipped to regain office as Prime Minister in the current elections and India's continuation as a democracy was said to rest with his success. Mr Gandhi played a major role on the world stage. He was head of the non-aligned movement, maintaining that non-alignment was the assertion of our right to look at the world in the way that we see it.
      </para>
      <para>
       He also maintained warm ties with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but at the same time broadened India's ties with the United States of America. Under Rajiv Gandhi, India and Australia shared many ideals on international and regional issues. We were members of the Commonwealth together, often promoting identical views at the Commonwealth heads of government meetings. Mr Gandhi visited Australia in 1986 and was instrumental in fostering an appreciation of our mutual interests. Mr Gandhi actively promoted continuing improvements in our relationship. At the time, he expressed a great desire to bring our two countries together in closer friendship, recognising our close regional proximity and opportunities for trade and cooperation.
      </para>
      <para>
       On behalf of the National Party I join with my colleagues in the Senate in expressing regret at the death of Rajiv Gandhi at such an early age. Mr President, the passing of Rajiv Gandhi is a tragic loss to India, and his contribution to international affairs will be sadly missed.

        —As all honourable senators will be aware, I had the honour of representing Australia, along with Mrs Hazel Hawke, the wife of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), at the funeral of Rajiv Gandhi in Delhi last Friday. I take this opportunity to add just a few words of my own to what has already been so well said by the party leaders.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Funerals are always moving and harrowing occasions, particularly so when conducted in accordance with the Indian cremation rites which are an immensely visual and tactile way of farewelling departed souls. A funeral is always harrowing when a person is struck down in the prime of life. It is always harrowing when the person involved is someone who has done a great deal for his or her country; the pain of the loss is that much more obvious when that is so. A funeral is harrowing, too, when it is of a person who has done a great deal for the international community and who is being lost forever from that stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       But a funeral is particularly harrowing, particularly gruelling, when one has some personal knowledge of the person in question. While I cannot claim the degree of personal friendship that our Prime Minister unquestionably had with Rajiv Gandhi and his family as a whole, I did have the benefit of three or four very long conversations with him over the last two or three years and a number of other more fleeting contacts. On the basis of that acquaintanceship, I do have to say that Rajiv Gandhi was really one of the most charming, delightful people that I have come across in public life.
      </para>
      <para>
       He was a person who was immensely interested and engaged in whatever the subject matter of the conversation was, as Senator Button has said so well. He was someone who, incidentally, was almost exactly my own age-I think there was a difference of just a couple of weeks-and on the basis of that and other things we established a degree of rapport which I certainly have felt with very few other international leaders whom I have had the privilege to meet.
      </para>
      <para>
       The man really did have none of those characteristics, or perhaps character defects, that we tend to associate with professional politicians. We all know in this chamber what I am talking about. I guess that is a function of the fact that he was not by nature, by instinct, a professional politician. He did not become a politician by choice but rather out of a sense of duty, a sense of obligation and a sense of what his country required.
      </para>
      <para>
       He was manifestly unhappy about the tag of arrogance or distance that had been associated with him and which had something to do with his previous electoral defeat. That kind of characterisation was foreign to his nature. It was not an accurate depiction of the character of the man, as I hope I have said. Quite apart from the political implications, he wanted to be able to throw off that characterisation of him and to be seen by the Indian people for the man that he was.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thus he put aside most of the security apparatus that had surrounded him in his previous campaigns and in his previous prime ministerial life. This time he conducted a campaign in a way that made him extraordinarily vulnerable to the kind of tragedy that ultimately occurred. He knew that but he was prepared to take that risk. Quite apart from anything else, he was an extraordinarily brave and courageous man.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rajiv Gandhi's passing in such appalling circumstances really is a tragedy for India, which has lost a fine leader and a fine man. It is a tragedy for Australia, which has lost a very good friend indeed. It is a tragedy for the larger international community, which has lost a man of real stature. He showed this by his performance, for example, in the context of the Commonwealth negotiations over apartheid in South Africa, in which our own Prime Minister was so intimately involved. It was also shown by the role he played in the non-aligned movement-a role which was wholly constructive, sane, rational and devoted to trying to shape and direct that movement in a way that was responsive to the new currents that were operating in international affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Above all, his passing is a tragedy for his own family. It is something that must have been very hard indeed for Sonia, Priyanka and Rahul to bear. They conducted themselves with extraordinary dignity and courage in the very gruelling circumstance that they were put through in the funeral last Friday. I convey to them again publicly here the very deeply felt condolences that I was privileged to be able to convey last Friday.

        —I follow the remarks made by my colleagues on both sides of this chamber in expressing my own deep regret at this appalling loss with the tragic death of Rajiv Gandhi. Just today I returned from a short visit to Canada and the United States of America. Last Tuesday I happened to be in the Canadian Parliament when this terrible news came. Shock and disbelief was expressed by those in my immediate company as well as by those in the Canadian Parliament that day. Throughout the world there is this reaction of great sadness at this appalling loss for India and for the world.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I support the remarks of those honourable senators who have already spoken by referring to three particular events that I will always hold dear when I think of Rajiv Gandhi. The first is particular to Australia. Rajiv Gandhi visited here in 1986 and, as Prime Minister, spoke at a reception and in other ways visited with some of us in this Parliament. This was in many ways the start of the renewal of Australia-India relations in these last five or six years. There were complementary visits by our own Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other members of this Parliament to India. There was genuine bipartisan support, and there still is, for the upward growth and renewal of our economic and other relations which really began with Rajiv Gandhi's visit to this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       As one who visited India for a few months when I was an undergraduate in 1966, and as one who has studied some aspects of the social and political developments of India, I was reminded by his visit that our relationship had lapsed and that it needed to be given content, meaning, energy and effort again on both sides. We have seen that effort and energy in reasonable measure.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secondly, I wish to refer to the economic reform that Rajiv Gandhi brought to his own country. From the beginning of his time when, so unhappily, he succeeded his assassinated mother in the position of Prime Minister, profound reassessments of the Indian economy were under way. This led to a clear call by those commissioned to give advice-including Professor Jha, Dr Abid Hussein who has now become my friend, and others-to open up the Indian economy and see it approach more international competitiveness with less protection and all the reforms that come from direct competition. Rajiv Gandhi had his heart in this, and I believe that the success of the Indian economy in the past five or six years has flowed from these kinds of reforms. I salute him and I salute those who advised him in setting out on that path, and I wish it to be continued.
      </para>
      <para>
       The third and final matter that I wish to refer to is Rajiv Gandhi's own deep sense of the need for reform within his own party, the Congress Party. I have at other times referred to his inspiring speech at the centenary function of the Congress Party in Bombay on 28 December 1985. I seek leave to incorporate a summary of Rajiv Gandhi's speech on that occasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Leave granted.
      </para>
      <para>
       The document read as follows-
      </para>
      <para>
       In his inaugural address to the Congress Centenary Session in Bombay on 28 December 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi surveyed the history of the party and recalled its struggle for independence and for making India a modern self-reliant nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, towards the end of the address he frankly criticised the administration, industry, trade unions, the education system, justice, the Congress Party and the Opposition. The following are his observations:
      </para>
      <para>
       Institutions: Too often, behind their imposing facades, the spirit and substance lack vitality.
      </para>
      <para>
       Justice: The poor have little hope of timely redress.
      </para>
      <para>
       Industry: We have industrialists untouched by the thrusting spirit of great risk-takers and innovators.
      </para>
      <para>
       Trade Unions: They now protect the few who have, oblivious of millions who have not. They feel little concern for the creation of national wealth, only for a larger and larger share.
      </para>
      <para>
       Universities: Teachers seldom teach and students seldom learn. Strike, mass copying, agitations are more attractive alternatives.
      </para>
      <para>
       Government Servants: We have government servants who do not serve but oppress the poor and the helpless, police, who do not uphold the law but shield the guilty, tax collectors who do not collect taxes but connive with those who cheat the State.
      </para>
      <para>
       Congress Party: Good Congress workers are handicapped, for on their backs ride the brokers of power and influence, who dispense patronage to convert a mass movement into a feudal oligarchy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Corruption is not only tolerated but even regarded as the hallmark of leaderships.
      </para>
      <para>
       Opposition: Non-congress parties have shown a cynical disregard for sensitive issues of national security.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Gandhi called for less consumption and more production and told the partymen to re-establish contacts with the masses.

        —As is clear from this summary, and indeed from the speech itself, there is no complacency about his own party's achievements after 100 years. He was directly factual and, I believe, truthful and just in his direct criticisms of his own party and the call he made for much higher goals and a much higher performance from his own colleagues. To some extent, his defeat as Prime Minister in the 1987 election resulted from his not being able to gain his party's support for the program that he outlined in the goals that he set forward in 1985 in the early stage of his leadership of the Congress Party.

       In looking at him, I do not see complacency or arrogance, nor do I see him only as the grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru or the son of Indira Gandhi. I see him as a person who was thrust into high office in India; who served his country well; who re-examined the status of his party and country; who set out a reform program for Congress and for the Indian economy; and who even sought to renew and build afresh his relationship with Australia. I salute him for all these points and for his essential humanity. I pass my condolences to his wife Sonia, his children and to all those who were close to him. As is stated in the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), I add my own hope that, as a response to this tragic event, there will be a higher commitment in India to democracy.

        —Mr Deputy President, I also support this condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) this afternoon. The world saw an appalling loss last week, and certainly India has shared in that appalling loss. A very good man who was a leader, but a reluctant leader, was cut down in the prime of his life. He was a very vigorous person who was ready to take up the challenge to lead India if called upon by the President after the election. This has not been just India's loss; it is more than that. Obviously it is a loss for the region and certainly a loss for the world. Also, it is a significant loss for us in Australia.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Mr Gandhi was very much a friend of Australia. He visited Australia in 1986 and was the only Indian Prime Minister to have done so. He had a very positive attitude to Australia and clearly was a very great admirer of our present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). When I met with Mr Gandhi in India, he said that he wanted to further improve relations with Australia and, as he stated, to put them on a fast track so that the potential in our relationship could in fact be given effect to in the future. He spoke of improved regional cooperation with Australia and, significantly, the focus of that was about keeping the peace. That was the focus that Mr Gandhi had as recently as last month when he said that India and Australia should work together in the region and elsewhere in the world to bring about peace. Certainly, in that context, he was talking about the current situation in Cambodia.
      </para>
      <para>
       In his period as Prime Minister and following that period, Mr Gandhi certainly pursued the agenda of opening India to the world. That included not only foreign policy but particularly the Indian economy. He was very keen to liberalise, open up and deregulate the Indian economy, and I am sure that few in India would disagree with that particular sentiment.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was only last month that Mr Gandhi welcomed me into his home in New Delhi. In fact, our meeting took place beneath a magnificent oil painting of his mother, Indira Gandhi, who was cut down by assassins in 1984. This home of the Gandhi family has been violated by this senseless act. I remember Mr Gandhi at the time as being very relaxed, thoughtful and certainly very well-briefed on what he was planning to do with regard to economic reform in India if elected. What struck me particularly and what was most noticeable about Mr Gandhi was that he was a leader and a politician who was really interested in a genuine exchange of ideas. He wanted to hear my views as an Australian as well as to put his views forward. It was very clear to me that Mr Gandhi was a very unusual figure for a world leader in that he was both a listener as well as a talker.
      </para>
      <para>
       He of course followed his mother into the position of Prime Minister of India after a very violent act in 1984. I think those people who would perpetrate violence must be made to realise that violence is senseless, short-sighted and achieves nothing. The perpetrators, if they gain anything from acts of violence gain it only in the short term; they certainly achieve nothing over the longer haul. Acts of violence are a plunge into the dark abyss where the rules of decent civilised human behaviour are broken. Everybody loses and nobody gains from acts of violence.
      </para>
      <para>
       Last week a very dark act was perpetrated in the bright light of Tamil Nadu. It fouled the very democratic process in India. It occurred just as the Indian people were exercising their right to choose a leader for their country-a right that many people are fighting for in other parts of the world. This afternoon I would like to add my sentiments to those already expressed here. I express my deepest sympathy to Mrs Sonia Gandhi and her family, the President of India, and the people of India.

       I mention very briefly the international contribution that Rajiv Gandhi made several years ago when, as Prime Minister, he was one of six heads of government who lobbied the nuclear superpowers in favour of nuclear disarmament. He did that through the sponsorship of the group Parliamentarians for Global Action. It was a very successful working group-not that we have achieved nuclear disarmament, but certainly the efforts of Rajiv Gandhi and other leaders who worked with him were quite substantial in furthering that international debate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course it is true to say that violence begets violence and that it does not solve anything. It never has and it never will. I think this has been dramatically demonstrated yet again in India-as if we needed that proved again in the world community. India has been plunged into chaos by this act of violence and I would like to support what Senator Bourne and Senator Maguire have said on that subject. It is not something in which anybody can take consolation, I think, even in the short term.

       India, where non-violence had one of its greatest adherents in the form of Mahatma Gandhi, has been plunged into violence again and that is a tragic loss for all of us, as well as for the Indian people.

       To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:
      </para>
      <para>
       The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       * That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the right to life to all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.

      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesman-like leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:

       The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.

       Report on Higher Education: Australian Capital Territory

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely affect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.

         —by leave-It is a matter of great regret that Senator Powell and, if I heard her correctly, Senator Vallentine sought to make a political issue out of the death of Professor Manning Clark. The fact of the matter is that the Senate used to have a practice of formal condolence motions, such as we had earlier today, being limited to the deaths of former senators. It then was extended to those who were Ministers from the other place. In more recent times, it has been extended further, and we have been expressing concern about that extension.

        There was one occasion when a young but eminent Australian died, a friend of mine, Robert Nesdale, who was the Director of the United Nations Children's Fund in Australia. There was a suggestion, at least on this side and I think on both sides, that there be a condolence motion. It was put to us that in such circumstances it might be better for appropriate statements to be made on the adjournment, and that is what we did in that instance. Professor Manning Clark, there is no doubt, was an eminent Australian and a great historian. I am probably one of the few in this chamber who have read most of his landmark work.

         —In response to the interjection, it is true, as I understand it, that the House of Representatives has had a more liberal practice in this regard; it has conducted less restrictive debates on condolence motions. When we put this morning that it did not seem to us to be appropriate to have a condolence motion moved in the form that we have on the death of a retired senator of this place or, alternatively, on the death of a Minister from the other place or even, in its wider interpretation, a former head of government of elsewhere, it had nothing to do with any base political motive. I and my colleagues are offended that that should be suggested.

        I am particularly disappointed in Senator Powell because, before she rose to give her notice of motion, of which I was not aware, I explained to her the basis upon which we did not think that a condolence motion in this case was appropriate. Now that she has tried to turn this issue into a political exercise, I put on the record that it is the view of the Opposition that Professor Manning Clark was a truly eminent historian. He was a pioneer in the field of Australian history, a prolific writer, and a writer of great quality. What particularly impressed me was his capacity to inspire countless students to read, understand and think about our past and the history of this nation. Australians should appreciate the major contribution he made to our society.

        As Senator Hill has pointed out, the practice in relation to condolence motions in the Senate has been progressively liberalised. It is my understanding-I stand to be corrected-that in the past condolence motions have been debated and passed relating to a number of prominent Australians: for example, Patrick White and Sir Robert Helpmann. It seems eminently appropriate therefore that a condolence motion be passed in the Senate for a person of the stature of Manning Clark.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent days, everybody who has written about Manning Clark has said that without doubt he was one of Australia's most eminent historians. He was very keen to stand as a individual expressing-as several other senators have said-very much the Australian individuality and reflecting to Australians the need to become truly Australian and not simply weak-kneed Europeans.

         —Second-rate Poms, as Senator Aulich points out. Professor Manning Clark has played a crucial role in raising Australians' awareness of their history and what it is to be an Australian. It is absolutely appropriate that a condolence motion should be moved. We are well aware of the statements of Professor Manning Clark in relation to many of the political positions taken by the Opposition. We are well aware that in recent days he was quite critical, as Senator Powell pointed out in her notice of motion, of the flickering and the guttering and the extension of the light on the hill, about which he often spoke in relation to the Australian Labor Party.

        Returning to my earlier remarks about Occam's Razor, when we have a sufficient explanation for a phenomenon, it is very difficult and perhaps unwise to look for other explanations. In earlier draft agendas for this afternoon's proceedings, a condolence motion was listed and then it was removed. It is absolutely appropriate that Senator Powell's notice of motion stands.

         —by leave-I rise to speak briefly on the matter raised by Senator Hill. A short time ago I gave notice of a condolence motion on the passing of Professor Manning Clark to be moved and debated tomorrow. When I discussed with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) the proposal to have a condolence motion on the Notice Paper today, I was surprised to hear that this was objected to by the Opposition. Senator Hill has explained that the Opposition does not want to see an expansion of where the line is drawn on the recognition of people in condolence motions. I take Senator Hill at his word that that is the reason the Opposition in the Senate did not want the matter listed as a condolence motion.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I point out, though, that it is a bit strange that there was full acceptance of this motion by the Opposition in the House of Representatives. Dr Hewson, Dr Kemp and Mr Carlton spoke to this motion extremely eloquently, as did government members, referring to the contribution that Manning Clark made to Australian public life. In view of that, it is a bit strange that a narrow view is taken as to whether it is appropriate for a condolence motion to be debated here today. As Senator Hill said, if the motion had been put, it would have been supported.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we take a conservative attitude about whom condolence motions will be moved, we restrict our view as a Senate representing the Australian people. It is absolutely acceptable that distinguished Australians-even if they are controversial figures-who have played a major part in the development of Australian life should be recognised. I do not think it is inappropriate for those who do not agree with something in which these people have believed to agree with the moving of a condolence motion.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly what happened in the House of Representatives today. In his speech in the House of Representatives, Dr Kemp made it quite clear that he rejected Manning Clark's thesis about Australian history, but he did so extremely eloquently. I am sure Manning Clark would have accepted, as part of the great debate of which he was so strongly in favour, that even in a condolence motion in the House of Representatives the debate continues about who and what Australians are and how we see ourselves and where we see ourselves going.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, there can be no set formula as to where to draw the line on who is the subject of a condolence motion. If we have to draw a line, we should err on the side of liberality rather than take a conservative view about whom we, on behalf of the people we represent, debate and express a condolence motion.

        I ask the leaders of the various parties whether, hopefully, tomorrow-even if it is not my motion, I do not think Senator Powell's is totally appropriate in the circumstances-we can get a form of words together even if it is carried without debate. I will certainly use the opportunity during the adjournment debate this week to express my appreciation, as an Australian born since the Second World War, for what I see as Manning Clark's contribution to my views about what Australia is and where it should be going. I believe that that would be a most appropriate outcome to this matter.

       <para>
        Wherever Manning Clark may be-if he did actually believe in an afterlife-he would be delighted that even on this day, a day after his funeral, there is still a matter of controversy about his role in Australian public life. I think he would even be delighted that we have had this slight difference of opinion and debate about his contribution and whether we should have a motion or not. In that sense, Manning Clark is still alive.

        It is timely that the report of the Australian Electoral Commission entitled Election Funding and Financial Disclosure Report should be tabled in the Senate today. I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the provisions contained in it. Of particular annoyance is the notice of motion by Senator Powell on behalf of the Australian Democrats, the inference being that the Liberal Party of Australia is opposed to disclosure legislation and provisions. That is quite contrary to the public statements that have consistently and persistently been made by the Liberal Party in opposition. We support full, fair and equitable disclosure.

        Perhaps Senator Powell will get some of her parliamentary colleagues to comply with existing rules and regulations on disclosure, particularly when some have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for non-lodgment of returns. Senator Powell might get some of her colleagues--

I will list some of the groups which have used the opportunity to express a point of view on an issue-a point of view that would be severely inhibited by the Government's proposed legislation supported, in part, by the Australian Democrats.

         —If Senator Powell would read Hansard and catch up, she would not make such an inane interjection because she is factually wrong. The position is that 10 days ago Senator Robert Ray said that if he were in Senator Bolkus's position, even if the motion moved on Thursday, 16 May calling for the tabling of the Burdekin advice and submission were passed, he would ignore it because it is not enforceable. The Government took that view because it did not want the advice tabled because of what Mr Burdekin had to say about the Government's proposed legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Now we have the report on the Government's legislation tabled in the House. What does it say? With relation to charitable organisations Mr Burdekin states:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am aware that to make exceptions from the proposed ban for charitable organisations or purposes, and not for others, raises problems of discrimination and may well render a ban administratively unworkable.
       </para>
       <para>
        As it relates to charities and organisations there is a suggestion from the Human Rights Commissioner that the Government's legislation is unworkable. What about overseas experience? Mr Burdekin goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The information I received from Stockholm indicates that the Council rejected the proposed ban on the basis that it would impermissibly restrict the right to freedom of expression.
       </para>
       <para>
        So a council overseas is taking the same course as the Opposition-the Liberal Party-has consistently and persistently proposed, that is, that the Government is restricting the freedom of expression of groups within the community. These are groups which use their opportunity in this democratic country of Australia that we currently have-groups such as the Association of Independent Schools; the Australian Council for Overseas Aid; the Australian Council of Trade Unions; the Brotherhood of St Laurence; the Australian Motor Cycle Council; the Over 50s Friendly Society; the Mountain Residents for Animal Rights; the Group of Concerned Small Business People; the Pharmacy Guild of Australia; the Taxis Combined Services; the Public Sector Union; the Private Doctors Association; the Tasmanian Logging Association; the Fishing Industry Council; and the Women's Electoral Lobby. The list goes on of people who have used their democratic right to speak up on issues that are affecting them within the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has put forward a proposal that will restrict, inhibit, regulate and ban people from exercising a basic democratic right when countries overseas are moving in the opposite direction.

What we have been working under in disclosure provisions until now is legislation which is so flawed that it has more holes than Swiss cheese or the colander that I have in my cupboard at home, and all of those holes have been exploited.

        It was possible for the Hawke Government back in 1984 to have passed full disclosure legislation. It had the numbers here in the Senate. It has been a matter of policy for the Australian Democrats since our inception in 1977. We welcome the Government's present legislation on disclosure with some amendment, because the Democrats believe the disclosure needs to be more immediate than is embodied in the Government's legislation. We certainly welcome it, unlike the Opposition which has opposed it in the House of Representatives and whose Leader has put out a press release behind the smokescreen of the political advertising aspects of that same Bill trying to justify an anti-disclosure approach. That is a complete 180-degree turn, which discredits the ability of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to carry an issue on which he has gone public. We have seen that happen before, but this is a tragedy for honesty in Australian politics.

       <para>
        We welcome the Government's disclosure legislation. It strikes me that what the Opposition has shown in the lower House is that it does not know how to amend government legislation. Here in the Senate there will be amendments on the advertising aspect to which Senator Olsen referred. We in the Democrats know how to amend and improve government legislation. Like the Opposition, we oppose the blanket ban on advertising which was proposed by the Government, but it is possible to amend and we will.

        With regard to the substance of this report, I refer to the sections in chapter 2 which refer to the problems encountered by smaller parties in lodging appropriate claims for election funding. This issue is pointed up particularly in paragraphs 2.25 and 2.27 of the report. I do this not just because I lead a small party but because it is an issue that has been addressed by the Electoral Commission in the report. It is an issue that has been discussed with officials of the party, certainly in my branch in Victoria. It might be of interest to those people who tried to run the furphy a few weeks ago about the Democrats wanting more election funding out of the Government's present legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, of the parties represented in this Parliament, we are the only one that did not claim the full entitlement. Part of the reason for that is the problems that are encountered by smaller parties, some of which are outlined in the report. It is a process which is very time-consuming, and therefore very expensive, for the Australian Electoral Commission. It only regards smaller parties and individual candidates and not the big parties, which have no problems in this area for a number of reasons. Firstly, as the report points out, the bigger parties not only have established structures and permanently staffed officers and so on but also have expenditure that massively goes above their entitlements. If there are problems, they can be avoided by the submission of other invoices and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        I raise this question because it is a matter of efficiency and cost to the Electoral Commission. It is something that ought to be investigated in the future for the better handling of public funding in election campaigns.

         —It is indeed timely that we have received this report today, the same day that we have received this not just misleading but downright dishonest notice of motion from Senator Powell that purports to say that the Liberal Party of Australia is resiling from its commitment to support disclosure legislation. Dr Hewson has put out a very clear intention which says that, if the subject matter in the Bill is split, we can deal with the question of disclosure here and now. Yet we see the subterfuge, the connivance and the dirty tactics of the Australian Democrats in trying to fudge the issue and say that somehow we are reneging on what we said originally when what we are opposed to is the banning of free speech.

       <para>
        Originally the Democrats, in their usual form, agreed with our proposal that the subject matter should be split. What we clearly need in this place is a full disclosure of deals done between the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats. One could put out a little bit of paper that said, `Watch this space for today's deal'. What did the Democrats get? Did they get more staff today? Did they get an agreement from the Government to give them support for a particular Bill that they want? What is the deal? It involves a windfall usually. They often say that they cannot be bought, but they sure can be rented.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can read on and take a look at the report. Our position is that we want full, fair and equitable disclosure. They are words which the Democrats like to bandy from time to time. But when one reads the likes of this motion by Senator Powell, which uses phrases such as `notes with profound disappointment the coalition parties' decision' and `strongly affirms and urges the coalition parties', one can clearly see that the deal has been done and stitched up in order that we may not properly debate the question of the banning of free speech.

Then we could debate what Commissioner Burdekin and everybody else has had to say on the need for free speech and the right of people to have their words broadcast. What is the point of having the right to speak if one is not entitled to have one's words published? What is the point of having this group of people who sit on the cross benches and exercise such vast and unlimited powers when they represent such a small group of people within the community? What is the deal that has been done that has brought about their reneging on their first agreement to split the two different and unrelated pieces of subject matter so that we may deal with them separately? The Democrats' cynicism and the manner in which they stay so close to the Government is something that more and more Australians ought to be able to see. It needs to be brought to the attention of members of the public more and more so they know that, when they vote for the Democrats, it is really a vote for the Labor Party.

It is not as if we did not have discussions with the Australian Democrats, who are quite aware of the position of the Opposition. It is a position which everyone knows. We are not opposed to disclosure provided that it is fair and equitable and provided that there are clauses in the Bill which would protect people against intimidation.

        If anyone should stand for the protection of individuals in this society against intimidation, it should be the Australian Democrats.

If one wants to see the evidence of this, one should look at the remarks made, in the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, regarding the Mafia.

        What Senator Powell has said is grossly misleading, which is not surprising. However, I am surprised at Senator Powell. I am not sure who put her up to it. It also makes one wonder-and it is something we are concerned about-whether a deal has been made with a Minister on the other side of the chamber who does not know what the propriety of contracts is, comes in here, pontificates about morality and does not know that one should not interfere with contracts once they have been let. That Minister sits with Senator Powell every time there is a division to make sure he has her on side. She then comes up with a motion which says we are not supporting disclosure.

        Let me make the position quite clear. We support disclosure, but we believe that it should be fair and equitable and should prevent people from being intimidated. We have never resiled from that position and Senator Powell and the Democrats would know that.

The Labor Party does not want to be reminded of the talking heads of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating saying that there will be no recession.

Several Opposition senators have referred to the fact that my name is listed in the report as one who has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I point out to those honourable senators who have raised the matter that I received no donations whatsoever during the election which is the subject of this report. A submission was made to that effect, albeit somewhat late. I guess the very extensive list of names of people who have made a late declaration is simply a list of those who got in before a certain date and the others are those who got in after a certain date. It is as simple as that. I received no donations whatsoever.

        I would like to correct Senator Kemp regarding another matter to which he referred-that is, the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) and grants. It is true that the Australian Conservation Foundation receives a grant from the Federal Government. Having been on the council of that organisation for some 17 years, I point out to Senator Kemp that every one of those grants to the ACF is in the public domain and anybody can look at those donations. None of the money which is made available to the ACF has ever been used for electoral purposes. On every single occasion on which the ACF has involved itself in an election, it has set up a separate fund to which donations have been made. Those donations have been declared. One can find the size of those donations actually recorded in the report which is before us. The repeated assertion that the ACF has somehow channelled government-donated money through for electoral purposes is entirely without foundation. It is a pity that the Opposition keeps on peddling lies in this place, which it believes it can do under privilege of the Senate.

         —I wish to comment on something not quite as colourful as the subject of the previous paper and probably it will not cause as much acrimony. I refer to the report of the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council at Nelson in New Zealand and particularly item 3D of that report-the national approach to bird welfare in the egg industry.

        There is certainly one person in my own State who takes more than a passing interest in battery hens. I refer to Pam Clarke. I note from an article today in my local newspaper, the Hobart Mercury, that she has vowed again to trespass at Parliament House after failing to be jailed for protesting against battery hen farming. I must say that Pam Clarke and her supporters in Tasmania have certainly put the battery hen situation on the agenda. It is something that everybody talks about and everybody knows about.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very pleased to see that, as a result of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, of which Senator Brownhill and I are members, and a similar report following an inquiry conducted by a Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry working group, particular motions were passed at the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. The Council noted that there are concerns about welfare aspects of the egg industry. The Standing Committee on Agriculture recommended that priority be given to research into improving welfare aspects of all layer bird production systems. That is what we have been saying consistently in our reports and what I have been saying publicly. That is where I am at odds with Mrs Clarke from Hobart. I have never advocated that battery hens are the best way to go, but at this point in time, and for quite some time now, they have proved to be the most efficient means of producing eggs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I just briefly refer to a particular paper that Senator Patterson gave me in which a very well known veterinarian, Olaf Swarbrick, made the comment that under the new systems all the problems that have been brought up about free range hens are just as prevalent today as they were in the past. He said that it will be many years before a new or better system will be found. We have been saying that consistently. I am pleased to see that the Australian Agricultural Council has taken note of our report.

During the debate on the motion that the Senate take note of the Australian Electoral Commission's Election Funding and Financial Disclosure Report, an assertion was made by Senator Olsen. I wish to respond to that by pointing out that it is a fact that my name appears in the report to which he referred, and in the sense to which he referred.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        Banking is, of course, one of the most fundamental and integral processes of modern society. It touches the daily lives of us all. Clearly, in a healthy democracy, those who hold the power and privilege of being bankers and who administer these processes on our behalf have the most profound of responsibilities to society. Yet there is ample evidence that banking is not being practised at its best in Australia today. Every daily newspaper in recent months has catalogued the dimensions of dissatisfaction with this most vital of financial and social processes. Recent history provides us with some remarkable examples of institutional financing at its worst- one needs only cite the revelations of the Nugan/Hand Royal Commission; the exposes in relations to Rothwells in Western Australia, Tricontinental, Pyramid and Farrow in Victoria to evidence the travesty of what has passed for banking in this country in recent years. Furthermore, the crash of a number of high profile Australian entrepreneurs who had been generously and imprudently bankrolled by Australia's leading bankers has very severely damaged an already suspect Australian image overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst concurrent royal commissions into state banking and the Federal Parliamentary Inquiry will go some way into examining specific aspects of bank practise, in the eyes of many they will not go far enough. In my view and that of many key witnesses, the current Bank Inquiry will not come to grips with the more serious aspects of banking malpractices in Australia. The premature and extraordinary disregard of vital evidence placed before it, and apparent lack of fortitude of the Inquiry, highlights a glaring need for a royal commission in order to de-politicise the investigative process thereby allowing a true revelation of the excesses and abuses of Australian banking in the 90's.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats have consistently argued that the deregulation of banking in the early 80's dramatically shifted the orientation of banking towards profit and that this shift, together with inadequate supervision of the banking system, has transformed the ethos of banking to the detriment of many aspects of Australian life, especially small business and farming.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no escaping the fact that banks enjoy a most extraordinary privilege-viz. the power to create credit estimated by conservative bankers at seven times held deposits, some would be far more audacious. If you and I were able to multiply our bank balance sevenfold and to continue to do so to any further deposits that might come our way, we would be delighted. This privilege, of course, becomes even more potent when banks lend these extraordinary windfalls to the less fortunate at exorbitant rates of interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        These realities are powerful enough in themselves but they became far more so when banking became profit driven in a deregulated market. This has, of course, been the situation in Australia in the 80's and 90's. As Australia's major banks have successfully pursued `superprofits', (a devastatingly appropriate term coined by Mr. Don Argus, Managing Director of National Australia Bank, in a confidential memo), ordinary Australians have paid an enormous price. Some argue that the provision of credits by banks is the essential dynamism of the economy in the prevailing development oriented model of today. However, credit is debt and the massive indebtedness of today-including personal, foreign and commercial debt-has been substantially and deliberately created and exploited by banks in their successful pursuit of superprofits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The difficulties which have flowed from massive indebtedness accompanying the bonanza of credit creation are frightening in their dimensions. When banks create credit they do so by mere ink on paper, or more accurately these days, with the flick of computer keys. However, they require that the borrower secure these debts with real assets such as a farm, a business or a home, (this is the crucial step which is the essence of the banks' power). They then require that borrowers service these debts at extraordinary levels of interest-rates of 18-34% have been quite common in the past few years. Obviously in servicing such high interest rates, businesses are bled white and are left unable to promote, develop, research or market products. These, of course, are the very processes which make for vibrant small business and primary producing sectors. Furthermore, if borrowers are unable to service these exorbitant rates of interest then the banks foreclose and sell the assets at a fraction of what they valued them in enticing borrowers into the debt in the first place. They can sell at such ridiculous prices because in real terms the bank paid nothing for the asset in the first instance when it acquired it as security by advancing `created' credit.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in Australia in recent years we have witnessed far beyond even this. In their pursuit of `market share' in the post deregulated context a wide variety of practices have emerged which are now evoking the community's ire. These range from excessive interest and a myriad of charges to malpractice and even corrupt practices. I have tabled much sworn and substantiated evidence in the Senate in the past three years, only some of which, such as the infamous Westpac letters, has received public attention. Certainly the foreign currency loans fiasco demonstrated how innocent borrowers could be gravely damaged by bank greed and suspect practices.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Westpac letters alone reveal a set of circumstances which warrant a royal commission-Australia's largest law firm, Allen Allen and Hemsley advising Australia's largest commercial bank, Westpac, that it had breached its fiduciary obligations at law, its statutory obligations to the Reserve Bank, had evaded taxes and committed fraud, all to make massive profit at ordinary Australians' expense. The fact that the Treasurer, Attorney General, the current Bank Inquiry, the Leader of the Opposition, and the parliament at large lack the will to address the very real imperatives presented by this evidence is indicative of a deep lack of moral courage. Little wonder, in the light of Nugan/Hand, Rothwells, Tricontinental, foreign currency loans, a timid and impotent Bank Inquiry and the ineffectiveness of the Reserve Bank, that those in the commercial banking sector feel so secure in their power and display such arrogance in its use.
       </para>
       <para>
        But our concerns should go much beyond that. We now find Australians in thousands moving inexorably towards bankruptcy because they are unable to service indebtedness. There has been in this first quarter of 1991 a 53.6% increase in bankruptcies nationally, with some States experiencing more than 70% increase. The associated foreclosures mean farmers leaving the land and business people leaving their businesses. The four major banks alone have warned shareholders of a massive provision for bad debts of $10 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those who administer the banking system at the highest level are themselves admitting to mismanagement on a national scale.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Reserve Bank admits to leniency and bank watchers and finance commentators cite the fact that leading banks have disregarded directives of the Reserve Bank.
       </para>
       <para>
        Attempts on the part of ordinary Australians to resolve their differences with their banks in the courts have revealed the callousness of banks in exploiting a range of tactics to both obstruct and delay just outcomes and even to pervert the course of justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whole communities such as the Eyre Peninsula and Nyngan have been devastated by bank greed. Many farmers have been reduced to the level of serfs and peasant farmers who will never escape the web of debt unless they are prepared to surrender properties they and their families have owned and farmed for generations. This web of indebtedness is almost all pervasive. The vast majority of real property in this country is to some degree or another mortgaged to financiers, especially to the banking sector. Through rampant foreclosure much Australian property must inevitably change hands. Foreign ownership and social dislocation are the most obvious outcomes, but the human tragedy and disappointment has many less apparent manifestations such as the breakdown of health, marriage and family.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only a royal commission with both broad and specific terms of reference such as those proposed in this bill will reveal the magnitude and nature of what bank greed has delivered upon Australian society. It is imperative that such a royal commission be initiated at the earliest possible time.

        This Bill would repeal Part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and substitute a new Part III which contains the provisions relating to the payment of service pensions and associated benefits for veterans, spouses and other dependants as at 1 July 1990. The most important features of the new Part III include provisions expressed in `plain English', shorter sections than in the current legislation, and easy to follow structure and layout of provisions, with each category of pension dealt with in a separate Division.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rewrite of Part III does not involve any changes in policy, has no financial impact or effect on Veterans' pensions or entitlements and does not alter in any way the responsibilities of the Repatriation Commission towards the veterans and their dependants. In this sense, the Bill retains existing legislative provisions as at 1 July 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill builds on past achievements in the simplification of Repatriation legislation. The introduction of the 1986 Act to consolidate and rationalise the growing body of Repatriation legislation in a single document was a major step forward in making that legislation more accessible and easier to understand. In the past five years, however, Repatriation legislation has been amended to meet the changing needs of an ageing veteran population and to keep pace with government policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has been particularly so in relation to the income and assets tests applying to service pensions under Part III. The result has been an unavoidable increase in the complexity of these provisions in Repatriation legislation, many of which reflect similar developments in Social Security legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Social Security Act 1947 has been entirely rewritten in ``plain English'' and was introduced in Parliament on 6 November 1990. Honourable senators will remember that the Social Security Bill 1990 was debated in the second week of the Autumn Sittings.
       </para>
       <para>
        As with the Social Security Bill 1990, the object of this Bill is to overcome problems associated with understanding legislation by using a `clear English' drafting style and a better format for presenting information. In addition, the introduction of step by step rate calculators consolidates into distinct modules all the provisions relevant to any aspect of the calculation of the rate of pension payable.
       </para>
       <para>
        With such arrangements in place, claimants for a pension or benefit could also work out their rate of pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another significant feature of the Bill is the repeal of the current section 5 and its replacement by a new section 5, still located in Part I of the 1986 Act, which contains an index to all the definitions used in the Act, while new sections 5A to 5R contain the definitions arranged by subject group. For example, all the war and operational area related definitions are contained under that heading in a new section 5B. These definitions relate to the type and nature of service performed, the areas and the periods of service. These definitions are important in assisting veterans to understand the way these terms are used when determining their entitlement to benefits under the VEA.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rewrite of Part III has been undertaken in consultation with the ex-service organisations which have been involved from the outset in its planning and organisation. In November last year an exposure draft of the partially completed Bill was provided to these organisations for examination of, and comment on, the content and format of the new Part III. The comments received have been both constructive and helpful in redrafting the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        More recently, extensive consultation has taken place with key representatives of the major ex-service organisations. Comments and suggestions for further improvement arising out of this consultative round have been incorporated into the final Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendments to the 1986 Act introduced in the 1990 Budget sittings and any amendments introduced during the current sittings, together with transitional arrangements, will be covered in separate Bills to be introduced later in these sittings. There will be on-going consultation with the exservice organisations in respect of the Rewrite Amendment Bills.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill represents a significant advance in making legislation more accessible to an ageing veteran community. It is in line with the trend towards `plain English' as the preferred form of expression in official documents. It is in line with the `access and equity' policy of this Government. Last but not least, this Bill goes a long way towards meeting the call for simpler legislation by both the ex-service and war widows organisations.

        Mr President, considerable effort has been made in completing this Bill to pave the way for more effective administration. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.

In the several volumes of information that have been supplied, I think that amount is now on the record.

In these circumstances the cruises go from New Zealand to Macquarie Island and then to Hobart and so, of course, there are customs, immigration and other services to be rendered. There would have been a delay in Hobart otherwise, and the cruise lines sought that involvement. That has been the practice and that has been the duration. At the moment that is all I can add.

        I begin with a question that I asked concerning the Oxford case, which was a case that was taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to test the validity of the practice by the Australian Customs Service of recording both the importer and the agent on the penalty history record. This case was miraculously settled by the Customs Service offering 100 per cent remission, which denied the AAT jurisdiction. I asked for the precise and exact timetable in which those matters took place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The information provided by the Australian Customs Service purports to convey the implication that there was simply a normal conference, that all the parties were in agreement and that the matter was duly withdrawn. In fact, that is not what happened, and one of the two documents that are missing is a letter from International Freight Forwarding Pty Ltd objecting to the matter not proceeding. That company wanted the matter settled and the practice tested. Another thing that is missing from information sought is the minutes of a meeting between Customs agents and the collector, held on 18 December 1990, where the recording of errors was raised and it was noted that, the remission having been lifted to 100 per cent, the AAT case was terminated. As the original offer of remission was 5 per cent and the amount of money involved was so small, I want to know what it was that caused the offer of 100 per cent remission to be made at the eleventh hour, after I had raised the matter in the Senate.

         —In that case, I will proceed with the Customs issues. I want to raise a matter that I raised on page 5 of the report dealing with confiscation of property at the Customs barrier. I refer to the Senate Hansard of 23 April when I asked Mr Kelly about a case concerning a Chinese woman who, with her husband, brought jewellery into Australia. I have since ascertained that she spoke no English. All her jewellery was confiscated, and she was kept for several hours in the custody of Customs. She was hounded in a way which any ordinary person would find quite unacceptable. Subsequently, it was found that all the jewellery, with the exception of one piece, came within the category of personal effects, and that the one piece that had been a gift to her from her workmates upon her leaving to come to another country had pushed her $150 over the $400 limit.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When I asked the Minister about that case, he said that it was not a question but a huge scenario, and nobody could agree with it. I pointed out that it was a factual case, but the Minister intervened and, finally, Mr Kelly said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no knowledge of the circumstances that you have described that would lead me to identify a particular case . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        He further stated that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it would not be our practice to pursue prosecution but, rather, the matter would be dealt with through the administrative penalty regime.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, this is a very sorry tale indeed, and it is important that all people know about the facts of this case because this sort of thing must be prevented from happening. It really is a disgrace. It concerns Mr and Mrs Lee. In fact, Mrs Lee was treated in exactly the way I outlined in the Senate Hansard of 23 April. As a result, Mr and Mrs Lee were prosecuted. A letter written to the Ombudsman states:
       </para>
       <para>
        It was a case clearly of persecution and not prosecution. The Australian Customs Service charged Mrs Lee with two offences which could only be regarded as trivial and, at considerable cost, Mrs Lee successfully defended the substantial charge of evading payment of duty which amounted to $115.97.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was very interested that the Minister's officers were pleased to tell us that the reason they did not continue with the defence of the Oxford case was that to have done so would have been to have wasted taxpayers' money. The Minister would be interested to hear that, in defending this persecution, it cost Mrs Lee personally and her husband $8,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second charge made against Mrs Lee was an absolute offence to which, on legal advice, both Mr and Mrs Lee pleaded guilty. She did not complete the form; she did not produce it to Customs; she was unable to read it since it was printed in English and not in Chinese; and she had reminded her husband of the presence of the jewellery when he was completing the form. Her lawyers suggested to her that her offence in respect of the form, completed by her husband, was less serious than the negligence of the Australian Customs Service in failing, contrary to counterparts in other countries, to print its incoming passenger forms in a variety of languages. Clearly, multiculturalism has not penetrated the organisation yet, but it is obscene to prosecute people, especially migrants, for being unable to read English. However, because she wanted to apply for Australian citizenship, she was compelled to defend the actions because they had a connotation of dishonesty.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, it cost her $6,000 plus an additional $2,000 to defend this case and to retrieve her own property. The interesting thing is that Mrs Lee was charged with three offences and, ultimately, convicted in respect of a gold chain on which duty amounting to $38.51 was payable. A multiplicity of three charges included in the one form was used in respect of a small amount of money. I have dealt previously with the question of multiple penalties. First, could the Minister say whether any of his officers remember this case?

         —The amounts are not the same, with respect. The evasion of both customs duty and sales tax in what the honourable senator has now identified as the Lee case involved much larger sums. I also gave an answer on this point, when Senator Bishop was talking to another senator, relating to the prosecution taken against both parties because, in Mrs Lee's case, there had been suggestions from her solicitors that action would be taken against the Commonwealth. It was necessary to clarify the issues in that sense.

        Between four and five o'clock that afternoon, after being told constantly that they were still in customs, my husband insisted on seeing the senior officer, Mr Hall. Mr Hall came out and immediately became abusive to my husband and my 22-year-old niece. My husband was very concerned not knowing why they were being detained. He rang me and advised that we should obtain the services of our family solicitor to get an explanation. Mr Hall told my husband that he wasn't to dare to get a solicitor down here and that he `Won't be frightened by the presence of one anyway'-an attitude which appears rather puzzling. His parting words were, `I can keep them as long as I like. I'm the boss here'. It is irrelevant to the issues at hand, but exemplifies the ACS behaviour and attitude.

Might I remind Senator Bishop that it is easy to read out allegations in here against a Customs officer, for example, when he is not in a position to deny those allegations. Presumably, that information from Mrs Lee would have been before the court and the Ombudsman by this stage. This is not a court of appeal from any of those other tribunals. In each case, before the court and the Ombudsman there would have been an opportunity to rebut the allegations; there is not that opportunity here to do that directly. It is very much hearsay in the course of proceedings in the Senate.

She was represented by a solicitor who has made available to me some of this documentation. I know that the solicitor who acts for Mrs Lee will be someone who will be recognised quite favourably by the Government because, although he is in private practice now, if we pick up a document entitled Estimates Committee A, Additional Information Received, Volume 2 and turn to page 31 we will find an opinion from the Australian Government Solicitor. It is signed per Mr Benson. Mr Benson is the same solicitor who is acting for Mr and Mrs Lee. Mr Benson has been useful in assisting the Customs Service previously. He is outraged by the treatment that has been meted out to two Australian citizens. He has used the term `persecution not prosecution' and one cannot help but feel, as he has brought other cases of this sort of behaviour to my attention, that indeed there is some unfortunate form of racial bias present in these actions.

If there is to be a prosecution it is normally pursued on the basis of advice from the Australian Government Solicitor after Customs has submitted a brief based on the belief that it has established a set of facts.

         —In dealing with the Lee case, I raised the point that Mr and Mrs Lee had been charged with three charges which arose from the same document. This seems to be in line with the sort of attitude that Customs has with regard to penalties being imposed for each error contained in the same document, and it seems that Customs is relying upon the advice of one Mr Miller. We now have Mr Miller's opinion, on which the decision is based. I asked whether or not that had been checked by senior counsel as to the validity of that, and I now ask the Minister to ask his officers whether or not they concern themselves with the criticism of that type of practice contained in the High Court decision of Scott and Geegan and Sons Pty Ltd, a 1969 case.

         —I am sorry; I suffer from the difficulty of not knowing what Senator Bishop is talking about. I might explain that in this way: she started off by asking me about a 1969 High Court case and in the second part of her question went on to ask me something which I apprehend to be quite different, the first part being about the questions asked in a declaration and whether there was a double or triple jeopardy as a result of the form of the customs declaration. I am afraid that I cannot help with that in the circumstances.

       <para>
        For the record, might I just advise that I have been told in relation to the Oxford case to which Senator Bishop referred that the amount of the penalty was $356. The Customs practice is not to proceed normally where the penalty is less than a threshold of $300. That is what I understand to be the case. In the Topper case, the amount of the penalty was $799. Those figures might be of some help.

        As I am advised, the questions in the survey did not ask how individuals voted in the last election or how they would vote in the next election. The questions sought to determine how the direction and strength of political values relate to other social factors. Political values are, of course, a significant component of social and cultural values and they are part of an analysis of environmental attitudes in Australia.

        The inclusion of party identification questions were for the purpose of allowing comparisons with surveys on environmental issues conducted previously in Australia and overseas which use identical or similar wording, including the Eurobarometer series which surveys many current issues in Europe-including environmental issues during the past two decades-and other Australian surveys. These questions may enable future surveys to make comparisons with the rack survey responses.

Whether one accepts the assertion that the survey did not ask people their political views, that is certainly not how the constituents with whom I had some lengthy discussions perceived it. They certainly saw the question of whether they thought of themselves as being close to a political party in an election year as being indicative of whether they voted for that political party, but I suppose that is by the bye.

        What really concerns me is questions such as those found in A6. For example, `Income and wealth should be redistributed towards ordinary working people'. Respondents to the survey were asked to indicate whether they believed that statement to be true and to indicate the strength of their identification with that statement. That is totally irrelevant to Senator McMullan's answer that people get their views from political parties. This is asking something which is completely different from their possible support for a political party, and I find that sort of question offensive and objectionable.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is asking people their views about matters that have absolutely nothing to do with the environment and absolutely nothing to do with forestry. It is great for Senator McMullan to say that questions such as identification with political parties are found in a Eurobarometer survey, but I want to know how questions about wealth redistribution and how unions should be dealt with under the law come anywhere near the ambit of questions in a survey that is supposed to relate to the forestry industry.

         —I was answering the question Senator O'Chee asked rather than the one he had in mind, but I understand the second point he has now raised concerning A6. I should have thought that anybody who has ever seen and been responsible for the analysis of market research would understand that a fundamental requirement to enable useful analysis of the answers one gets to the primary questions, is the capacity to effectively correlate those answers with other factors to enable subsequent comprehensive statistical analysis to be undertaken.

        This is the first time I have seen this survey. I have not analysed in detail each of the questions and formed a view about whether I think each and every one of them is the most appropriate basis for correlation. There is a range of such questions which is a useful mechanism as an indication of underlying social attitudes and, from that, useful correlations might be drawn.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a waste of the taxpayers' money to ask for surveys to be undertaken which ask the basic questions but do not allow questions to be asked which allow effective correlations to be made. There is no doubt that there is justification for the nature of the questions that are in A6. At this stage I cannot leap to the defence of every individual sub-part of it because I have not had the opportunity to study it, but I support the general thrust of doing surveys in that manner. I think it is the only way that anybody conducting such a survey would get value for money from the exercise.

        Senator McMullan says that those questions are there to allow interesting and useful correlations yet members of parliament, the general public and other interested groups do not have access to the results of questions A6, A7 and A8. As a consequence, the assertion that they make interesting and useful correlations is simply ludicrous because none of us can draw the correlations. Why were the results of those questions not included in the report that arose out of the survey? Who has had the opportunity to make these interesting and important correlations?

In the interim this information is currently available to the Resource Assessment Commission and, through the Resource Assessment Commission, to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Effectively what this survey has done, especially with a long time lag between when the survey was first conducted and when the raw statistical data will be made available not only to members of the public but also to members of the Opposition, is that this survey has acted as a means by which the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and our Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, have received opinion polling relating to political issues at taxpayers' expense, which information has been withheld from the Opposition. Therefore, I request Senator McMullan to give an undertaking to provide that raw statistical data forthwith to the Parliament and to table it in the Senate.

If that is what Senator McMullan is saying, it really means that this matter will not be subject to further scrutiny until April or May of next year, in almost 12 months time. I would rather hope that the results may come out before the next Estimates so that the matter can be properly considered.

I know that Senator McMullan was not there, but it was made very clear to the officers at the hearing that we were talking about a postal survey in relation to the timber industry. They raised the matter of the Kakadu National Park. I certainly did not. To ascribe to me the red herring that the departmental officers raised is very cunning of the departmental officers but not satisfactory. In some ways I find it disrespectful to the Senate that the departmental officers should try to ascribe to me their own misunderstanding and their failure to be able to come to grips with the fact that there was a survey. The departmental officer who was present at the Estimates that evening said to me that he did not know of any postal surveys. Why did the departmental officer not know of any postal surveys?

In fact, I will be looking at the entire Resource Assessment Commission the next time we come to Estimates later this year. Certainly I did not find the conduct of either that departmental officer or the people who appeared on behalf of the Resource Assessment Commission satisfactory. I am making that comment now so that it is recorded in Hansard and so that the departmental officers are fully on notice that they should expect a question relating to any activities that they have been undertaking.

        I have one final series of questions in relation to this matter. I understand that the survey had a bar code on the back. In the answer provided by the Resource Assessment Commission to the question it took on notice, I am told that the bar code was used to follow up the questionnaires that went out and, in particular, the respondents who did not answer the questionnaire. The answer to my question on notice indicated that the particular matching of bar codes and respondents' names and addresses was destroyed. I am very concerned that respondents did not know, or were not told at the time at which they received the questionnaire, that the questionnaire contained a bar code which would be used to follow up their lack of response.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am also concerned that at no stage was any indication given to the respondents that any possible matching of information would be destroyed. I am still not absolutely satisfied that respondents to this questionnaire can rest easy. I suppose it is difficult to prove that either way. I want it noted that this caused a great deal of anxiety to people. They received letters which, irrespective of whether they were intended to be intimidatory, were certainly perceived as being intimidatory. It upset respondents. On the whole it was very unsatisfactory. The manner in which the survey was conducted, the nature of the letters and the persistent way in which they were received by the respondents caused a great deal of upset. Unless it is absolutely and critically important to the survey, I would certainly be recommending that that sort of approach not occur again because of the great degree of concern it caused people who had received the questionnaire and who were, after all, sampled at random.

         —In general I want to make two points regarding those comments. The first regards the nature of the letters and the conduct of the survey overall. I have not seen the letters, although I have had some briefing on the way the survey was conducted. Australia has a well developed body of market research companies and consultancies which conduct researches such as this in a reputable manner and have done so consistently over time. Although I have not had dealings with the company concerned in this instance, I know well that the consultant on the design and analysis of the survey, Professor McAllister, is a thoroughly reputable individual.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On the written information I have had, I believe that the survey was conducted entirely properly and with propriety. I acknowledge what Senator O'Chee says. When people receive the most innocent of letters from government, they find it very alarming. A person will ask, `Why has the Government written to me about this?' If the Department of Social Security writes to people and says, `Your pension has gone up', they worry and seek advice about what this letter really means for them. I do understand that letters that come directly and indirectly from government bodies have to be more sensitive than others. That is a matter that ought properly to be taken into account in future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although I have not personally supervised the destruction of the documents, I suggest that there is a much more productive use of both the time of Senator O'Chee and the Senate than conspiracies about whether individuals have kept information or whether a research consultancy, which would have no possibly sensible use for it, has kept information. That is a fairly unnecessary slur to which I would not want to give too much credence. I accept that the material is being destroyed, firstly, because I have been told so by reputable people and, secondly, because I cannot see why people would want to keep it. The information that has been extracted from it is all that people would reasonably want. It is important that surveys such as this are conducted in accordance with proper standards. I have no reason to believe that this one was not, but it is important that we ensure that they are.

          —Senator Short, I draw your attention to the fact that I cannot find anything in either the report or the supplementary papers which would indicate that you would have the opportunity to ask questions about this. Since you indicated that you were going to stick primarily to the key issues and were not going to ask a lot of irrelevant questions, you could seek the leave of the Committee. I presume Senator McMullan would have no objections to answering that question. It is entirely up to the Committee to give you leave.

         —The figures released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics contained an error in relation to New South Wales. There was an overstatement of New South Wales tax revenue of $269m for the year 1989-90. That was the amount of payroll tax paid by government agencies. The Bureau has since admitted its error and published a revised figure, but I would seek some explanation as to how such a very important and gross error could possibly have occurred in the figures.

         -I make the point that, when the error was detected, the Premier of New South Wales said, `I'm not suggesting that the Statistician is part of any terrible plot by Mr Keating to help the New South Wales Labor Party and to help his leadership bid next Tuesday'-which is today- `because I've got no basis for saying it'. So the Premier acknowledged that point, but he did go on to say, and I endorse it, `It is a disgrace, in my view, that the Bureau got that figure so wrong at such a politically critical time'. Again, Senator McMullan will probably have to take this on notice, but I want to know why those figures were released at all two days before such a critically important political event when, as I understand it, going back to the last five years, the corresponding figures in 1986 were released on 7 April; in 1987 on 9 April; in 1988 on 15 April; in 1989 on 17 February; and in 1990 on 11 April. It would appear that the release of the figures was running late anyway. How anyone could have had the naivety to have released those figures-I use the word `naivety' generously-particularly with the possibility of errors in them, at such a critically important time is a very serious matter. No doubt we on this side of the chamber will want to take up that issue in due course when the explanations that Senator McMullan has sought are forthcoming. On behalf of the coalition I want to record our extreme concern about this matter.

He said that because we did not give any forewarning, he does not have the officers present at the moment. Seeing that we have to consider the report of Estimates Committee A after 8 o'clock, could the officers be available after that time so they can deal with this issue? I believe it is extremely important that both we and the public understand why the figures were released. An explanation has to be given as to how the error came to be made.

         —In response to what Senator Short said about timing, if there had been some unwarranted, deliberate delay in the presentation of the information, I think that would be cause for concern. But once the information is in the hands of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and available for release, the question of timing is not an appropriate one for criticism. Had it had the information on the Friday and chosen not to release it until the Monday, we would have had equal controversy. I think it has to release the information when it has it. I will ensure that the timing of the release of the information is part of the response that comes back. I will inquire whether an appropriate officer is available. But given there was no warning we may not have an officer who can give the appropriate information at 8 o'clock. If not, I will provide an answer to the chamber as soon as I can get one-promptly.

        In relation to just how significant this error was, I want to put it on record that the effect of the error was to show New South Wales as a higher taxing State than other States. In fact, had that error not occurred, the increase in taxes and revenue in New South Wales for 1989-90 would have been shown as the lowest percentage increase of any State at a figure of six per cent. Not only that, but the fact of the matter is that when the Greiner Government came to office average tax rates in New South Wales were 4.6 per cent above those in the other States. In 1989-90, the year in which the error occurred, New South Wales tax rates were down to only 0.2 per cent above the average of other States. Indeed, there is a very strong probability that when the figures become available for 1990-91 the New South Wales figures will be below the average of the other States. The New South Wales record over the past three years far outstrips that of any State in that department.

        I want to raise a matter relating to the questions that had not been answered at the conclusion of our hearings about act of grace and ex gratia payments. Senator McMullan will recall that various questions were asked by both Senator Bishop and me in that regard as far as they may relate to Mr Burke, and other issues came up as well. In the Estimates Committee it was said that, if Mr Burke's termination payment-at that stage Mr Burke's date of termination was effective from 31 July; since then the resignation date has become effective immediately-came under the normal severance provisions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Finance would not be involved; it would be involved only if an act of grace payment were made.

        The answer I received to that was that the most recent year for which deductions for subscriptions to trade unions, et cetera were separately recorded was 1986-87 and that the statistics relate to subscriptions to trade, business or professional associations. I was told in answer that `for 1986-87, total deductions for subscriptions to trade, business or professional associations amounted to $377m and the cost to revenue was $162m'. I ask whether the Taxation Office has a breakdown of those subscriptions and deductions and the cost to revenue on the basis of trade, business or professional associations.

I am not confessing great expertise in this matter but, as Senator Short would understand, as I am advised and as I recall it, there is a question on the individual tax return which has three categories of trade, business or professional association, individual rights in the association, and the amount. The Australian Taxation Office would key in that yes, the person made a claim under that category and that it was a claim for X. There would be no reason for the Tax Office to key into the overall records which of those three categories it came in. One would have to go back through all of the nine million or so forms and hand tabulate them, asking, `Which category does this particular person's claim come under?'. Some people may claim under more than one category. It is not the sort of information that would readily come out of the normal processing of a tax return form.

Income of trade unions and associations of employers registered under any industrial relations law is exempt from income tax. It is specifically provided by section 23f of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Therefore, they do not pay tax on their income, whether it is received from subscriptions or otherwise.

         —Hypothetical questions do not take us far, but this might be more useful. If the income is income of the trade union or the employers association, it is exempt. If it is income from a body which does not constitute an association of employers or employees registered under an arbitration Act, it is not exempt. I do not want to get into a case of whether A or B would be exempt, because that is a matter for legal opinion or interpretation by the Commissioner. I can only tell Senator Bishop what the law says: if the income is the income of an association of employers or employees, then it will be exempt; if it is not that body's income, then it will not be exempt. It will depend upon the nature of that holding company and its relationship with the income. If the income constituted a separately registered body that was not an association of employees or employers, of course it would not be exempt. If it was nominal and the income became income of the trade union in some manner-and it is not for me to speculate about why-then it would be exempt. The law is fairly clear.

Maybe they invested the donations; maybe interest was paid on it; or maybe they chose to simply hand over some of that money. If such a company existed and individuals or corporations made donations to that company, and that company paid all or any of that money or its income investment back to the trade union, firstly, would that be treated as money of the trade union; secondly, would it be required to file a taxation return; and, thirdly, what would its status be for the purposes of so-called future transparent and total disclosure of any donations-bearing in mind it could be acting as a warehouse, perhaps for the Australian Labor Party?

I imagine that that particular body would have a pretty rough time with the Commissioner of Taxation establishing that it was such. If the Commissioner of Taxation or whichever tribunal this was contested before decided that the company did constitute an association of employees or employers, then it would be exempt. If they were not able to be convinced, then it would be not be exempt-which is the answer to Senator Bishop's previous question.

The answers that I received from the Taxation Office about this matter have certainly shed light on the cost of the modernisation project. However, I want to point out that this is the first time, and only as a result of the special questioning that we undertook in Senate Estimates committees, that it has been possible to obtain the information on the cost of this modernisation project.

        Neither the Budget Papers of 1988-89 nor the Budget Papers of 1990-91 provided detailed information on the reasons for the increase in costs of the modernisation program. I think that reflects very badly on the Government's preparation of Budget Papers, particularly on the Department of Finance which prepares statement three of Budget Paper No. 1. The 1991 Budget Papers prepared by the Taxation Office last year are full of detail of a descriptive nature about the modernisation program but contain no hard facts on the actual costs to be incurred.

        As a result of the questioning that we have undertaken in Senate Estimates, for the first time we have an easy identification of the increased costs-we are talking about $750m-expected over the life of this project. We now know what that comprises, but nowhere in the Budget Papers can that be found in its entirety. I would like an explanation of why the Budget Papers do not contain sufficient information-in fact, almost none at all-on the escalation of the cost for this project.

Subsequently, I ascertained that the amount of money involved was not $8m but, in fact, $16m.

        The only solace the Minister can give me is that the Australian Government via EFIC will try to persecute some Australian builders of the boat who were taken in by this man and who have been sent to the wall. The Government is going to try to screw them for their guarantees. In the meantime, Mr Cantor has a $25m boat which he enjoys the fruits of and he boasts around New York that he has it courtesy of the Australian Government.

It is all very exciting, I know, but it is slightly premature to be going on about this until those proceedings are concluded and until there is a default under the loan-if there is a default. The honourable senator began this latest question-not question, speech, if I might say so-by referring to Government largess in providing money to this ship building facility. Firstly, let me say that the Government largess, as the honourable senator calls it, is not any strange or silly hand-out. The bounty payment is made under legislation passed by this Parliament, for which Senator Bishop voted, and it is made in accordance with that legislation. So let us not get too carried away with that particular aspect of the largess. In so far as there is an alleged failure of Austrade and EFIC, this allegation is a little premature.

Does the Minister think that anyone will get any joy out of thinking we may get back some of the money which the Government has paid out by selling up ordinary Australians' houses in Brisbane so that the Government can get a measly few hundred thousand dollars in the kick, when in fact all Mr Cantor-the man connected with the Gambino family-has to do is keep up his repayments over eight years at 8 per cent and he has a boat worth $25m, of which the Australian Government and taxpayers have kicked in a further $8m?

        The loan which is creating so much excitement at the moment is one out of $23.8 billion worth of exports supported by EFIC over the past five financial years. I must say that, if the worst came to the worst, it would be unsatisfactory, but the worst has not come to the worst at this stage. But it is a very small amount in terms of the business which is done by EFIC in support of Australian exporters. We dealt with this in the context of the Estimates Committee, and I do not have terribly much more to add. It would be unfortunate if the honourable senator's direst predictions came true, but I think it is too early to make them.

The fact that the officers with whom the Minister is now dealing are paid for by public money and the fact that, in the final analysis, the Minister is accountable in this place means that we have to have proper and prudential arrangements. I am profoundly disappointed that the Minister finds that the loss of millions of dollars is something that can be simply smiled at and something about which it can be said, `Well, we are not doing too bad. Near enough is good enough. She'll be right, mate'.

         —I beg your pardon; somebody else must have been in the chair. The question relates to the payment to Mr Burke. Both Senator Short and I asked questions at Estimates about the nature of the payment. Senator Short's question received an answer that the Department of Finance was not involved with the payment. I then asked: if it was decided that the payment was not a determination but was an act of grace payment, would the Department of Finance exercise its right to make that payment? Mr Barrett of the Department of Finance answered that he would be most reluctant in those circumstances to do so.

       <para>
        We have had three separate answers from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in this chamber. The first answer was that the power relied upon to make the lump sum payment was the general power conferred on the Minister by the Governor-General to make terms and conditions. On the following day, the Minister said that he relied on clause N of the terms and conditions. Then we were told that in fact he was relying on clause 2A(ii). Those three answers are inconsistent. At least two of them have to be wrong, if not three.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were told finally that there was no way there could be a unilateral resignation. Anybody would know that. All that had to occur was that the resignation would be received. If that were done, my information is that the money would have been taxable at the highest marginal rate of 48.25 per cent but that if Mr Burke was terminated by an order of the Executive Council the sum would become an eligible termination payment and would be taxed at the rate of 31.25 per cent. In other words, the benefit to Mr Burke was not the $7,000 difference between the $28,000 and the $35,000 but, in fact, a further $3,000 which would be approximately the benefit of that taxation benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Could two things be confirmed: firstly, could Treasury be most helpful and tell us whether the payment will be taxed at the lower rate-31.25 per cent-and, if not at that rate, whether it will be taxed at some other rate which is a lower rate? Secondly, could Treasury tell us whether this payment is finally to be construed as an act of grace payment, as I believe it ought properly to be? If so, it would therefore be taxed at the ordinary rate. Furthermore, it would have to be approved by the Minister of Finance (Mr Willis). Has the Department of Finance become involved in the deliberations of the need of the Minister to approve that payment? I add that it is not an approval that the Minister can delegate.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Walters spoke about the response when the error was discovered. I will deal with that first. I think the Secretary of the New South Wales Treasury contacted the Australian Statistician during the afternoon and within an hour of that contact-I would not want to be precise, but approximately within an hour-a press release was issued by the Statistician and faxed to the New South Wales Treasury. The Treasury was immediately aware of, and able to take what action it chose with, that information, and publicly released in the usual way in mid-afternoon.
       </para>
       <para>
        My understanding-and the best information I can give-is in two parts: firstly, the problem arises from a double counting of pay-roll tax paid by New South Wales Government authorities, and this should have been netted out from the figures as released. My further understanding is that this information was first released on 28 March and, prior to that, had been made available to the New South Wales Treasury which had raised a number of queries about those figures with the Statistician, but not this particular one. So those figures were released on 28 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        What was released last week was a minor revision of those 28 March statistics and a disaggregation of the 28 March figures, rather than new information. There was no reason of which I am aware to challenge the accuracy of those figures because they had not been challenged when previously made available to the New South Wales Treasury. It is probably fair to say that there was somewhat more excitement about correcting it last week when the political significance of the statistics became available to the New South Wales Treasurer. He must have conducted a more rigorous review than he did in March.

        I will now try to give the Committee some information about the timing of the release of the statistics, which is the other outstanding question. Senator Short gave some comparisons about the dates of release in other years and this year. Those figures that were released on 28 March, which are closely related to the relevant figures, were released at the same time in the previous year. The revised figures, or second phase release, was somewhat earlier but the timing was governed, as it should be, by the fact that they were released as soon as the figures became available.
       </para>
       <para>
        While it was politically sensitive to release the information before the election, it would have been equally politically sensitive to have delayed releasing it until after the election. The Statistician's obligation is to release the information as soon as it becomes available and that is what took place. This information was, as I expected and anticipated, released by the Statistician as soon as it became available irrespective of the external circumstances because that is his obligation, and it was discharged on this occasion.

         —A few questions arise as a result of those answers. I will start with the last answer. Did the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) decide to put out a news release on its own and, if not, why not? Did it just report to Treasury and say, `We made a horrible mistake. We will leave it up to you to make the corrections'? Why did not the ABS decide to put out its own news release saying, `We have made a horrible mistake'?

        Senator McMullan said that the news release occurred from midafternoon onwards. I heard the evening news but I heard no reference to it. I guess that that has nothing to do with anyone but the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It was the station I was listening to. I certainly heard it on the 10.30 news that night. There was nothing on the news the next morning, which was Saturday, or on AM with regard to it. I was particularly concerned because I did take note that it was not on either of those sessions. I repeat: did the ABS decide to put out its own news release, follow it up and make sure that as many people as was possible in New South Wales were contacted on every channel to receive the news that it had made that extremely poor mistake at that time?

It was comprehensively covered on the television news in Sydney that night, although perhaps not as comprehensively as Senator Walters would have wished. I often find the same thing with stories.

I would have thought that, as a result of the first lot of mistakes, the ABS would have been doubly sure, particularly when it was going to release them at such a very sensitive time, and that it would have gone over those figures so thoroughly that a mistake could not possibly have been made. With all the best will in the world, once that mistake saying that New South Wales was the highest taxed State was released and campaigned on so heavily for two full days, it would be very difficult to undo. I find it extraordinary that the New South Wales Treasury was the one, again through queries, which had to bring to the attention of the ABS that it had made yet a further mistake.

         —Senator Walters has profoundly misunderstood the significance of those 28 March figures and my comments about the corrections. Firstly, my understanding is that the process of sending material to the relevant State treasuries-not just New South Wales-prior to the release of information and then having a discussion about the way it is presented, the nature of the material and making corrections and modifications on the basis of information from State treasuries, is normal and had happened with regard to all the States, not just New South Wales.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The significance of what I said about 28 March is that the New South Wales Treasury had the information about the tax statistics, which were so controversial in the middle of May, prior to 28 March and made no queries about them. It did not say it did not think those figures were right. It raised no questions about them. The figures that were released in May were figures that had already been checked and not queried by the New South Wales Treasury. That is the significance of my point about 28 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        That does not excuse anybody making an error and nobody would seek to do that. It does say that the normal processes by which the possibility of error might be checked were undertaken and that those errors had not been detected by, amongst others, the New South Wales Treasury. That does not pass the blame for the error to the Treasury of New South Wales; the blame still lies with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and it accepts that. Senator Walters has to accept that that is the significance of the 28 March release, not that there is some deficiency in the ABS such that New South Wales has to keep pointing things out to it. This is part of the normal interchange of information.

         —I would like to talk very briefly about the Australian Taxation Office. Given the generous attitude during the Senate Estimates hearings, I do not intend to use this Appropriations debate to pursue certain outstanding matters. However, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer whether it would be possible to have a response to a matter that I raised in a discussion of matters of public interest which concerned some guidelines arising from the Moorby case.

        I take this opportunity of thanking the Parliamentary Secretary, Senator McMullan, and all those officers from the Australian Taxation Office who appeared before the Committee and also others who provided the written answers. I remind the Committee that many observers, including practitioners and others, believe that the Senate Estimates process involving the Australian Taxation Office is now compulsory reading. I think the openness of the approach has again restored to the Parliament an information source that is very necessary in our Westminster system-a source that, regrettably, was neglected by the Parliament, with the vacuum being filled by certain outside groups with access to the Australian Taxation Office. I am pleased that this mandate to the Parliament has been restored.

         —Before I respond to Senator Watson, I will respond to Senator Short who asked a question before the consideration of the Committee was suspended for dinner. I did not have an opportunity to answer it before the suspension. He was concerned about the lack of detail provided on the modernisation project in the recent Budget Papers. There was a fair amount of detail in the 1989-90 Budget Statements. In view of the time, I will not talk about that at length; but I am advised that the long term project is proceeding largely to plan and, therefore, we felt it was not necessary to include further details in the most recent Budget Papers. Given that Senator Short has raised this matter and that a lot of taxpayers' money is involved, the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Finance will examine the possibility of including more details about the project in forthcoming Statement No. 3 for the 1991-92 Budget. That should answer the question which was asked when Senator Vanstone was in the chair prior to dinner.

          —I would like to raise with the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) the question of the future of the North West Cape communications station. The Minister will recall that at the Estimates Committee B hearings on 16 April I raised this question and was told that negotiations with the United States of America in relation to the takeover of the station by Australia had not progressed very far up to that period, despite the fact that it was a year after the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had announced that Australia would be taking it over. I was told that there would be a seven-year transition or phase-in period for Australia to take over control of the facility from the United States.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         I was also interested to know whether at the end of that period, when the takeover is completed, there will be any United States presence there. I had a very firm answer of no from Major-General Grey to that question; in other words, that there would not be an entire withdrawal by the United States. It was with some considerable surprise that less than a fortnight later it was reported that the American commander of the base had informed United States personnel on the base-there are 400 of them-that they would all be withdrawn by October 1993. I understand from the answers to some questions in another place, I think it was, that that has been confirmed. In any event, it has been confirmed by other means that the United States now does intend to withdraw its 400 personnel by October 1993.
        </para>
        <para>
         Within a fortnight of the answers given to me at the Estimates Committee hearing in April-assuming that those answers were accurate at the time-there was a very sudden change in the situation concerning this important matter. I would like the Minister to bring us up to date as to the exact position and why the decision to withdraw the American personnel by October 1993 was apparently not known by him or by the officers present at the time of the Estimates hearing. Perhaps of more importance is the exact situation on the base as from October 1993 when the American personnel are withdrawn. I ask: how many Australian personnel will be required to operate the base as from that date? Will we have sufficiently trained personnel to do so within two years, or will some American presence remain thereafter, and for how long? Obviously, from the information we now have, the Americans do intend to withdraw entirely from that base.
        </para>
        <para>
         The other question which is of vital importance relates to the cost to Australia of the takeover of the facility. It was said that there would be negotiations about these cost arrangements, and that was to be an ongoing process of bargaining and so forth, but in view of the fact that the withdrawal is now to occur within two years instead of within seven years, I would expect that there would be something more definite about the cost of this transfer. At what stage will the Australian payments be required to commence?

         —The answers given in the Estimates Committee were accurate. What has substantially come out is the United States Navy's view of its timetable. At the moment it is not a United States Government view. Therein lies the difference between the answers given at the Estimates Committee and the information that Senator Durack has alluded to today. What I said in the Estimates Committee still holds.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The major negotiations surrounding the timetable will occur at the next Ausmin talks, which are likely to be in October this year in Australia. If in fact the US Government adopts the Navy's view and decides to pull all of its officers and ranks out of the base in October 1993 instead of over the seven-year period outlined after talks between Secretary Cheney and me, we would have to look at that timetable again. I have not yet had any official communication from the Secretary of Defence to this effect yet. We will certainly be discussing the matter at that time. Senator Durack has asked whether, if this does occur, we will be in a position to fill the void, if you like. That void would be sought to be filled not only by Royal Australian Navy personnel but also by civilian contractors. Senator Durack also raised the cost of the facility. I repeat what I said at the Estimates Committee, that that will be subject to negotiation on a government to government basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can only presume that the reason for the US Navy putting forward its view so publicly at the moment, from last October until now, is the enormous pressures the US Navy is under to make cost savings. The United States Defence Force is facing a very major cut in expenditure over the next three years of at least 12 per cent in real terms from its previous high. I suppose it is its responsibility to put forward as many cost savings proposals as possible, and according to its preferred timetable. But I repeat: at the moment that is not an official view from the United States Government, and I would expect that this and other matters will feature in those discussions at the Ausmin talks.

         —We seem to be faced with a rather extraordinary situation where the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is saying that the statement which had been made by the commander to the personnel at the base is that, to use the Minister's words, the United States Navy intends to withdraw the 400 personnel by October 1993. At the Estimates Committee hearing, Dr Dibb said:

        I will be going to the United States next month to follow on from the negotiations that Senator Ray had there last year.

       <para>
        That month has now practically past and, presumably, Dr Dibb has been to the United States. But in light of this bombshell, as one might describe it-certainly it has been a bombshell to the people of Exmouth-I would have thought that the official view of the United States Government would have been known by now. I would have thought that Dr Dibb, having been there, would have found that out or the Minister would have found it out by communicating directly with the United States Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        We seem to have an extraordinary situation where a distinction is being drawn between the decision of the Navy to withdraw and the decision of the United States Government, which may not be in favour of withdrawal in two years time. Is the Minister saying that this whole matter is going to remain in limbo until the Ausmin talks, which I gather are scheduled for November this year? By then, the situation may be that there will not be a withdrawal by October 1993. If that is the case, is there some other date which is less than seven years hence or are we left with complete uncertainty over the next few months as to whether there is going to be this withdrawal by October 1993?

        Senator Durack asked about Dr Dibb's visit to the United States. That indeed did occur but, regrettably, my briefing from him on the results of this trip is tomorrow morning and was not this morning; otherwise, I could expand a bit more on what he may have discussed in this regard. But whether it was proper and right for the US Navy to make its position known in the way that it has is a matter that will probably be discussed in October.
       </para>
       <para>
        The position at both the last Ausmin talks and the bilateral talks I had with the Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, was that a seven-year timetable appeared to be the most appropriate. Therefore, there was ample time to discuss things such as: the cost of the facility; a phased-in Australian command of the base; and a phased withdrawal of US personnel. I have not had any communication from Secretary Cheney that changes any of that. Therefore, I assert that is still the United States Government position.
       </para>
       <para>
        These issues will be discussed in detail in October-not November as Senator Durack referred to-and we will be making a statement afterwards. We have also given a commitment, once the position becomes clear, to brief our civilian work force-the whole township is very much dependant on the base-as to how we see its future in terms of how many personnel we will require and what other developments may occur there. We have committed ourselves to that process and we will keep our commitment.

         —I refer to two issues, one relating to an unanswered question as at the date of the Committee's preparation of the report and the second relating to an issue on which I have filed a reservation. I refer to the question that was taken on notice at the Estimates Committee hearings with regard to the construction of housing by the Defence Housing Authority, generally known as the Sheppard contract, at the Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal and to the response that was provided to me on 7 May. The response reads:

        The contract sum for the project is $3.088 million; variations totalling $36,495 have so far been approved for items that would normally arise in a project of this nature. Negotiations are continuing on other variations claimed by the builder.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw to the attention of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) that I consider that to be a very inadequate answer, given the nature of normal contract administration. Surely, the answer should have indicated what variations in the nature and cost of estimated works there were on this particular contract. Given the nature of my question on notice, I would have thought that a more comprehensive answer could have been provided, detailing the degree, significant or otherwise, of the variations anticipated, and even some cost estimates of the likely nature of additional costs-particularly as the question was taken on notice and some weeks elapsed for the answer to be provided. I wonder whether the Minister is now in a position to provide the additional information with regard to that particular contract that I believe ought to have been provided to the Committee.

         —The point I make is that the question was taken on notice on 16 April. The answer that is printed was given to me on 7 May. I am not looking for information that would indicate the degree of commercial dealing that I understand, naturally, has to go on, but I am asking whether or not the variations under negotiation are significant. If they are significant, what is the nature and the cost of the anticipated blow-out of the particular area? I do not want the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) necessarily to give me a dollars and cents figure, but I would like to know whether the variation could be in the order of 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 60 per cent or 100 per cent of the initial contract price.

        I draw to the Minister's attention the fact that at the Senate Estimates Committee last year I raised a whole series of questions with regard to the very unusual nature of the tender process and to the successful tenderer, a company by the name of Shepherd, which was brought in for the conduct of this project under very unusual and abnormal arrangements that were set in place against other tenderers within the Northern Territory. I referred to the fact that a successful tenderer, who had formerly carried out work for the Defence Housing Authority in South Australia, was picked up and transposed into this project. It created quite a degree of controversy at the time and I am, therefore, keen to establish to what extent the cost blow-outs on this contract will vary from the original cost estimate.

I would have thought the negotiations would be finalised by then and Senator Tambling could get the figures then. It is not possible for me tonight to establish what the variations were. All I can say is that the figure of $36,495 has been approved so far, and negotiations continue on the other amounts. It is appropriate that Senator Tambling ask those questions at the next Estimates Committee hearings in the spring, and get the figures then. I am not in a position tonight to say whether, in my opinion, significant or insignificant amounts remain to be negotiated.

         —It concerns me that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is not prepared to pick up the concerns that have been expressed. Given that today is 28 May and the answer that was given was provided on 7 May, there has been a further three-week period since the date of the tabling of the response that we currently have access to. I had hoped that the Minister would be able to say tonight whether the petty cash item of $36,000-which I accept as being quite routine and standard-would in any way have been varied. To leave this matter until the contract would be well and truly concluded-the time of the October Estimates Committee hearings, when we will again have an opportunity to review it in fine detail-could well give us major concern.

        As the Senate is well aware, the construction of Defence housing at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Tindal by the predecessor to the Defence Housing Authority-the Australian Construction Services-has been fraught with very considerable difficulty. In fact, the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, has outlined that 17 cases of fraud were under investigation within his own Department. Of course, that did not cover any of the investigations for fraud that were also under way in the Department of Defence, the client department.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Defence Housing Authority has taken over the role of providing housing. This is a new contract. It is one about which I am keen to ensure that there is no continuation of accusations of fraud against the Department of Defence as the client department or in the Katherine contracting community. I would have thought that the Minister would appreciate the serious nature of this, and would not have seen fit to sideflick it until we get the opportunity to look at it in a more audited way next October, when the contract will be well and truly concluded.

His point is probably fair when he says that to wait until October when the additional information becomes available is too long to wait. I accept that point and, therefore, will give him a response when the negotiations are finished, and the moment we are notified that there are further variations I will let him know about that. I do not have a time line on that. I imagine that it will not be too long before these negotiations are concluded and I will then send him the figures rather than wait until October.

         —I thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for that response. The second issue that I wish to refer to this evening with regard to Defence matters is that on which I filed a reservation as, in fact, I have done across a number of departments on issues that relate to the coastal surveillance function and apprehension and surveillance across northern waters.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There was a series of questions in this area taken on notice in advance of the Estimates Committee hearings and asked at the time. I notice that the Department of Defence on this occasion has chosen not to provide discrete financial estimates with regard to the operation of either Navy or Royal Australian Air Force facilities that have been applied to this important function that closely follows the work of illegal fishermen in north Australian waters.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the previous financial year I think we ascertained that figures well in excess of $20m in the Department of Defence estimates were allocated to this function. I am not implying in any way that those estimates are for work that ought not to be carried out-in fact, it should be so. However, the need for very close work between, I think, eight or nine Commonwealth Government departments that are involved in these important functions, shows that the Department of Defence has to take a very prominent role because of the issues that have been raised.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that in recent weeks there has been a change and that the Coastwatch organisation has taken over a much larger part of the surveillance burden. This will, of course, require adjustments in the various Budget estimates of the Department of Defence. I had hoped that the Department would be in a position to give us estimates of just how these changes will impact on the Department compared with those that are now more properly being carried out by the Coastwatch organisation. I am aware that a number of my colleagues would probably contend that other government departments may not be the appropriate bodies for the air surveillance that is necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been a number of comments in this regard by many people across the community. While I have certainly challenged the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, to take a far greater leadership role in negotiating particular arrangements with the Indonesian authorities, particularly in relation to the apprehension of illegal fishermen, it is certainly an issue that has to be pursued.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note comments made by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshall Ray Funnell, in the Australian of 20 March this year. Air Marshall Funnell said that control of the air-sea gap was an objective. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is certainly not a reality. We do not even know what is going on there, let alone being capable of controlling it. Until we do know what is going on in there, we are always going to be in a position of disadvantage.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this context it is particularly worrying to note that there appears to be an increase in attempts to make illegal landings across Australian territory. We are well aware from the statistics that there have been increases in the number of fishing vessels apprehended in Australia territorial waters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, while we have concentrated our efforts on illegal fishing, we must never walk away from the responsibilities that these other functions also have with regard to drug smuggling and drug activities across northern Australia. There has to be very close cooperation not only with the Indonesian authorities on matters such as illegal fishing, but also with Papua New Guinea, particularly in relation to drug activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until such time as the coordination activities between the various departments, including the Department of Defence, really do streamline our northern and coastal surveillance regime, there will be extremely difficult periods for us to address. I hope that in the Budget estimates that we will be able to look at in October, the Department will not seek to hide behind the cost analysis of these important functions and will, in fact, make available to the Senate a full breakdown of all costs related to this activity.

        The general question that Senator Tambling has raised does cross a number of portfolios, but the parent body of Coastwatch, of course, is the Australian Customs Service. If he has major policy areas to raise there, I suggest that he raise them under those estimates. Other than that, what Senator Tambling said was more of an editorial, which may or may not have merit, but there is nothing to be answered specifically.

From the Government's announcement, I understand that it bought this section of Carrington's operations because of its importance to the inshore mine hunter pro- ject. I raise the following questions: what has the Government in fact bought? Is it part of the slipway, property, equipment, or simply the right to use the property? What is the relationship that this has with Carrington Slipways? I understand that construction will not be proceeding with the rushcutter class mine hunter, with the plastic hull, until probably some time in 1992. What does the Government propose to do to keep that facility available for that construction when it is required?

         —Following a company offer, the Department purchased the equity of Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd in the mine hunter construction facility in October 1990. The facility is now known as the Department of Defence Shipbuilding Facility, Tomago. A licence agreement enabled the CSPL to operate the facility under Commonwealth ownership. In December 1990, Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd was foreclosed, and Messrs G. Hall and G. Kelly of Price Waterhouse were appointed as agents for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia as mortgagee in possession of all assets of CSPL. The agents advise that the obligations of the licence agreement under which Carrington operated the facility would not be met and the licence was subsequently terminated in January 1991.

        Representatives of several Australian companies attended an industry briefing held at the construction facility on 11 February 1991. As a result, an agreement was signed on 22 February 1991 with R and H Transport Pty Ltd for storage of inert carbon anodes in a non-construction area of the facility. If a suitable operator is not found for the construction area, the facility will be mothballed pending a decision on further mine hunter inshore construction. An announcement therein will be made on Thursday as to the future of the mine hunter program.

         —No, I am not claiming that at all. In many of these things, on an embargoed basis, it is usual to brief people beforehand. On this occasion, we are making sure that various interested parties are briefed beforehand. As I said before, that will include the RSL and some of the union movement involved. I must say that my previous experience is that they are the last ones to break an embargo on these matters. A variety of others will be pre-briefed on this particular subject. However, I did desire as much as possible, having gone through the Cabinet process, to put down a statement in Parliament rather than just as a press release or holding a press conference on it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The fact has to be recognised, as I now recognise, that so many people in the end-and I am talking about within the Defence Department-must have the issues run past them. A press release could not be issued in some of these matters without some of it leaking at times. I have often said that Defence leaks on some of these matters but does not leak on security matters, so at least we have it the right way around. However, I would prefer that no departments leaked, but they do. As such, I can understand some angst that a variety of press reports-many of which are inaccurate, by the way, but some of which are accurate-preview it before it is seen in Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a couple of lessons to be learnt from that-either have the press statement straight away or time the Cabinet decision and the statement in Parliament for the same day. I am not sure that that is always workable because we have to print documents. I give this example of why there is a delay in Cabinet making a statement to Parliament. I want to make available to this Parliament the force structure review; the interdepartmental committee report on Wrigley; the corporate communications plan; probably an executive summary of the two previous reviews; and, by the time we overcome some printing difficulties, some of the documents on the Ready Reserve. I will try to put all of those out at the one time and have all of them printed. I also intend to have a publication printed to give to servicemen so that they know about the proposals, and that will take a week or so.
       </para>
       <para>
        But I accept criticism that too many aspects of this have leaked out. I do not know of any Minister at any time who has been able to track down and stop leaks absolutely. I recall that at one stage the Opposition's whole Budget was leaked and we never found the perpetrator of that.

If, as he said, the Parliament is to be the first to know, I question why any of these briefings should take place before the Parliament is informed. Why is it that the Defence Force personnel, who are surely the people most intimately involved in any major changes to the Defence Force, are the last to be informed-after the union movement, after foreign defence attaches, after the Returned Services League, and after people who have some defence base or other facility in their electorate? I think that seems a very strange order of priorities.

        I do not want to spend the time of the Senate labouring the point any more, but I ask: which members of the union movement have been briefed? I understand that that occurred last week. There will be quite a long time-lag in this whole briefing exercise. It does not seem to me that the Minister is coming to the Parliament first. I understand that the union leadership was briefed on about 22 May. Why was it briefed so early? Who was briefed and what was the justification for this briefing?

I would like to raise a few matters relating to questions that were taken on notice and I would like to follow up some answers. The first issue is a small one relating to a trust fund which I have asked about on a number of occasions in the past. It relates to the Fedorczenko legacy fund. During the Estimates Committee hearing I asked a question which was taken on notice. The question I asked was:

       <para>
        The Fedorczenko legacy fund is something I have asked about in the past, and I wonder what has happened to it. Have any changes been made to its investment? Has it been made use of at all, or are we still at the stage of receiving proposals for its use?
       </para>
       <para>
        That question was taken on notice but when it came back with an answer the question read, `What is the Fedorczenko legacy fund and what is it being used for?'. That misses entirely the detail that was required in the question in the first place. It has distorted the question I asked. For some unaccountable reason I have chosen to decide that it is not a deliberate distortion and it is not the fault of somebody who does not have the ability to copy. I would appreciate it if in the future my questions were taken down unaltered. This is not the first time it has occurred. This may not seem to be an important issue but it concerns the principle of taking a question on notice and giving an answer to the question that was actually asked.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am particularly interested in this fund because this has been an example of Defence's bad management. This money, which was left by an old Pole for the defence of Australia, sat for several years without earning any interest. I was told that last year $1,764.95 was at last spent from the fund. I was even more surprised to find that for that amount all that was purchased was one book and one lecture. I would be interested to know what the title of the book was and I would be interested to know its cost. Was it gold-plated? Pedro Fedorczenko left his money for the defence of Australia and I am not sure he would have been all that happy to see Sir Ninian Stephen collect the money for one lecture. Can I please have more details about these unsatisfactory dealings and the unsatisfactory expenditure of moneys from that fund?

        In terms of the summary of your question, we face a dilemma. If we wait for the Hansard to come out we get criticised for delays in answering the question. So this question was not taken from the Hansard; someone has taken a summary of it. The honourable senator has criticised the summary and we will take that criticism on board. But the intention was right-to get the question as quickly as possible, get an answer and get it cleared through the system and back to the honourable senator. I will get details of the costs involved in the expenditure of $1,764.95-how much the book cost and where the money was expended in terms of that particular item. I will write to the honourable senator about that.

        Let me take up the earlier point that Senator Newman raised. She said that I have been briefing journalists. The only briefing I have given journalists was as to the philosophical approach of the force structure review, which occurred at a defence correspondents' lunch some weeks ago. If she is inferring that since then I have talked to journalists about the force structure review and given them information, the answer is no, I have not. The only time it has been raised by journalists with me in a direct sense-that is, personally-was at the Melbourne Press Club lunch about a week ago. I made it quite clear to them that I was not going to give them any answers in advance of informing the Parliament. The answer is no: I have not leaked to the journalists on this question. The honourable senator may or may not accept my word, but I would be pretty game to say no here if in fact I had leaked and there could be evidence adduced to that effect.

         —I thank the Minister for the answers. I turn now to the question of recruitment advertising. I asked by way of question on notice how much had been spent on recruitment advertising in 1991 for Army, Navy and Air Force, and I was told that the total was $12.323m. However, Brigadier Buring told the Committee, in answer to a question by Senator Vallentine on recruitment advertising, that the advertising allocation for the financial year is $16.1m. I would like to know which is the correct answer. If the $16.1m is correct, can I please have that broken down between the Services as I asked in my question on notice?

         —I understand that the explanation is that Senator Newman's question asked how much had been spent on recruitment advertising in 1990-91, which we are still in, for the Army, Navy and Air Force. That is where the figure of $12.23m comes from. The financial year is not finished yet. Those figures were probably based on the latest available information, which was given in March. Therefore, we have another four months in which to spend another $4m, although recruiting is going so well that we may be able to make some savings.

         —So one was a part-year figure and one was a full-year figure. I thank the Minister. I turn now to the question of recruiting overseas for the 60 engineers. There was $350,000 spent recruiting 60 engineers, I think in the United Kingdom. I was told in the Estimates Committee hearings that not all the bills were in yet, so the cost could be even higher. That recruitment took place in the last quarter of 1990, and since Defence went through the selection procedure it has not been able to bring those recruited into Australia because of requirements of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Both say that Defence has to satisfy them that suitable engineers cannot be found in Australia.

        As the Committee would realise, it is a very costly procedure to have to readvertise in Australia and to keep the recruits still hanging on overseas. I believe that Defence would not have been going overseas to get these engineers if they had been available here in the first place. I understand that DEET has not in fact advised the Department of Defence that it cannot recruit these engineers overseas. Can I be given a progress report on what is happening with this overseas recruitment?

I have also had assurances that there is no reason whatsoever why Defence could not answer those sorts of questions, such as how much it has spent on Comcar, et cetera, in one financial year. I do not understand why Defence cannot do that, and I would like to have an explanation of why we cannot be given that sort of breakdown in its expenditure. If the Department of Administrative Services has been able to tell me how much it billed Defence, I simply cannot understand why Defence cannot say how much it had to pay for these things. After the hearing, somebody said informally that Defence does not need to know that sort of thing. If that is the sort of attitude that prevails, it seems to be a pretty unsatisfactory one when it comes to taxpayers' money and accounting for management or otherwise.

        Perhaps I can draw the Minister's attention to some of the answers. At a time when we are looking at economies in the Department of Defence, when we are looking for savings-we all are-when we want to have more and more effort put into the sharp end in our ability to defend the country, we need at least to have a handle on how we are spending the housekeeping money, if you like.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Administrative Services was able to say that $5.8m was billed by the Australian Government Publishing Service to the Department of Defence in 1989-90 for all categories of printing. It also said that the Department of Administrative Services billed the Department of Defence approximately $700,000 for the provision of cars to Senior Executive Service and senior military officers. It also said that Comcar billed the Department of Defence, excluding the Services, for Comcar, contractors-that is, taxis and hire cars-and both Comcar and contracted buses as follows: Comcar, approximately $790,000; contractors, approximately $128,000; and buses, approximately $122,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we turn to the assets services business within the Australian Construction Services, we find that it billed the Department of Defence a total of $67,039 for the lease of computer hardware to run a specialised ACS maintenance management package that assists Defence in managing its repair and maintenance program. The Australian Property Group billed the Department of Defence $246,402 for security; $119 for waste disposal; and $65,888 for telephones. Australian Archives billed the Department of Defence $155,028.80 for storage and related servicing of certain classes of temporary and unevaluated records to the end of March.

        The Ionospheric Prediction Service charged the Department of Defence for computer software services $21,000 in 1989-90 and $3,500 in 1990-91. The assets services business within ACS billed the Department of Defence a total of $25,000 in 1989-90 for staff development and training courses. In 1989-90, the total amount of Defence's removals bill, which includes removals and storage, charged by the Department of Administrative Services was $63.3m. Those items are the housekeeping costs of the Department of Defence. They are properly accountable to the Parliament. I fail to see why it is so difficult for the Department of Defence to tell us how much it spends on those items when those are the bills it gets from the Department of Administrative Services. Why is it that the Minister needs $1m in order to be able to tell us the answers?

         — To take one example, the printing bill from the Australian Government Printer is not our total printing bill. No-one said that Administrative Services cannot provide some gross amounts that it charges us. Of course, it cannot. Senator Newman reduces the Estimates committee budget management to an absolute farce by asking a question such as the one following. In the financial year what is the total amount the Department, including the Australian Defence Force, spent on the following items: Commonwealth cars, hire cars, Cabcharge, domestic airfares, overseas airfares, provision of Senior Executive Service cars, security, cleaning, gardening, laundry, catering, removals, storage, waste disposal, pest control, purchase and maintenance of indoor plants, purchase and maintenance of paintings and works of art, electrical services, fire protection, printing brochures, printing of staff business cards, printing of posters, stationery, staff development training courses, study allowance, travel allowance, removal allowance, legal expenses, compensation, office furniture, advertising, recruitment advertising, postage, telephone, computer hardware, computer software, exhibitions, overtime, child-care and display models. That is one question. In a time of constrained resources, I do not know how much it would cost to answer that question, and nor should Defence be configured to answer that type of question-not if we want to have proper accounting procedures, et cetera, within Defence.

It goes against every Estimates committee report of the past few years where pressure has consistently been put on us to bring down this sort of Estimates program. Senator Newman is trolling back to the situation of 15 or 20 years ago. If we do not have those systems in place-and we cannot set up a specific system to answer her questions-what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to divert enormous resources by going to every base in Australia and asking, `How much have you spent on printing?'. Should we go to every section of the Department and ask, `How much have you spent on pot plants?'.

        In some senses, I agree with Senator Newman that past practice in Defence has been wasteful. The Defence Department recognises that itself. As an example of the direction we should head into, let us take the situation of a base commander. That base commander should be fully responsible for his budget and he should know where every cent is spent. But that is best done at that level, not by saying that we are going to spend $220m on X amount of items right across Defence. That is not the approach to take. We do not need to know how much is being spent on cleaning in every section of the Defence Department. We need to know that we have got the correct managers in bases, or whatever other context it be, and that they have the right amount of information available. They do not at the moment, but the computer systems are catching up.

        Honourable senators opposite should not blame us for this situation, because it goes back historically to their period in government that they do not remember any more. I must say it is getting harder to remember it is so long ago. It is hard to remember when those opposite last won an election. When was it? It was 1988-one out of about 25. Leaving that aside, the direction to go in is to say to, for example, the head of Puckapunyal, `This is your budget; you have to manage it the best way you can'. They have not always had the right inputs in the past; that is admitted. That has to be rectified and it is on the way to being rectified. The way to manage the Australian Defence Force is, frankly, not to know whether $160,000 has been spent on business cards right across the Defence Force. It is not by spending I do not know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in getting an answer to that question. That is not the direction in which to go. It is not suggested by the Auditor-General that we go down this particular path.

It is true that one or two other departments will be able to answer those sort of questions, because they have nowhere near the same complexity and nowhere near the same sort of numbers or expenditure as this Department. If you had asked me in my previous incarnation, when I had a budget of $230m, I might have been able to devote the resources and get the answer.

         —Social Security is nowhere near as big as Defence, other than in the money it spends, which is mostly on sending cheques out automatically, as Senator Newman well knows. It has a fairly uniform approach in terms of regional networked offices, all of which are the same. Defence, as Senator Newman should realise from her travels around Australia, is completely different from that. The way to get on the top of these costs is to make the managers manage on their budget, to give them some incentive-and there would be incentive-to save on all these items, because they want another project down the track and they want to be able to fund it.

         —On the evening of Wednesday, 8 May this year I represented the Senate at Government House for an official dinner in honour of the President of Turkey. I was required to be at Government House at 7.30 p.m., which was also the scheduled time for the Senate to adjourn. When a division was called for at about 7.18 p.m., I asked Senator Bjelke-Petersen to take the Committee chair and conduct the division. I left the chamber and proceeded to Government House. The Hansard record shows on page 2982 that Senator Bjelke-Petersen was in the chair for the division and that I was paired.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        An adjournment debate commenced shortly afterwards, but by that time I was on my way to Government House. Actually, I arrived there slightly late, but so too did many other guests due to a traffic accident close to the Governor-General's residence and to strict security measures which were in place along the way. The result of all this was that I missed the only speech made that night on the adjournment. That speech was made by Senator Herron.
       </para>
       <para>
        Normally I would have read the Hansard report of Senator Herron's speech the following day. It is my usual practice to read in Hansard the next day any of the Senate's proceedings which I have not been able to follow either in the chamber or on the internal television transmission of proceedings. That particular week, however, was a particularly heavy one for me in terms of official duties-without doubt, it was the most busy week that I have experienced this year. As a result, I did not read Senator Herron's speech and it has only recently been brought to my attention.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have mentioned the reason for the delay in referring to claims made by Senator Herron that evening because I would normally have commented on it, if not the following evening, then at least on Monday, 13 May when the new parliamentary week commenced. On page 2984 of Hansard Senator Herron states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier today Senator Robert Ray made a cheap jibe at the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party and attacked my colleague Senator Macdonald. The Deputy President at the time named Senator Macdonald because he was so incensed at the attack made upon him.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to examine matters relating to the second sentence in that quote. Senator Herron has correctly used the two pronouns `he' and `him', but to make the matter absolutely clear I stress that these two pronouns referred to Senator Macdonald. In other words, it was not the Deputy President, but it was Senator Macdonald who was allegedly incensed at the attack made upon him, that is, upon Senator Macdonald.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having established who was incensed, I refer to the claim that I named Senator Macdonald. That claim is incorrect. In over 12 years of chair duty in this chamber I have never named a senator. I hope that I never have to do so but if it ever becomes necessary I will not shirk my duty to do so. What I did that partic- ular afternoon was to warn Senator Macdonald. I do not issue warnings lightly. Senator Macdonald is one of only three senators whom I can recall ever having warned for unacceptable behaviour in the Senate. On one occasion, I indicated to another senator who has since retired that he was running the risk of being warned. When I issue a senator with a warning it is an indication that, if that unacceptable behaviour continues at the time of the warning, the next step is that the senator will be named.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reference to page 2901 of the Senate Hansard shows clearly that it was a warning that Senator Macdonald received. He was not named. There is a gulf of difference between the two terms.

        —The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Employment Service collects data on numbers of unemployed awaiting placement at local CES office level (local UAP) for internal management purposes only. The data is not released because it is neither an accurate measure of unemployment nor a reliable indicator of changes in unemployment. General release of UAP data would involve an undue use of Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) resources in preparation of material and responses to inquiries, yet it would provide no additional reliable information on the labour market.
      </para>
      <para>
       The UAP data is based on records of registrations held in CES Offices. While the CES removes individuals from the register when it becomes aware that they are no longer seeking work (e.g., they have found work or they have left the labour force), registrants are not required to inform the CES when this is the case. (Unemployment beneficiaries are, of course, required to inform the Department of Social Security). To seek to ensure that all individuals are removed from the register as soon as they find a job would require an undue and unjustified diversion of CES resources to this task. Further not all people seeking employment register with the CES.
      </para>
      <para>
       In short, the UAP data essentially provides a measure of the number of people who have registered with the CES and are still listed as possibly requiring assistance, but unavoidably it includes many who no longer require this assistance. It is certainly not a measure of the level of unemployment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The inaccuracies and distortions in the data are especially significant at the local level.
      </para>
      <para>
       The most accurate indicator of the number of people in Australia actually seeking employment is available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimates, collected via the monthly Labour Force Survey, which are specifically and rigorously designed to measure unemployment in accordance with International Labour Organisation standards. These ABS figures, which are the official measure of unemployment in Australia, are available monthly for 60 regions in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       DEET also prepares annually a document titled ``Developments in Regional Labour Markets-Australia''. This provides estimates, based in part on regional data from the ABS Labour Force Survey, of unemployment levels and unemployment rates in Local Government Areas. While I would stress that the figures in this publication are only estimates and not the actual situation, they do provide the best available estimates of unemployment at a local level. The next update of the document covering the June quarter 1990 is currently in preparation. DEET is also taking steps to ensure greater timeliness in the production of these estimates in the future.

       (2) Yes. Each of the grants schemes under which non-Government organisations may be funded has its own published conditions of eligibility and rules of operation (variously titled). These guidelines set out the objectives of the particular scheme, financial and program accountability requirements, and other details. I have arranged for copies to be provided to the honourable Senator.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Various mechanisms are in place. The major ones are the requirement for each grantee agency to agree, with the Department, on a specific work program for each grant or project before it commences. This is to ensure the project is working towards clear and agreed outcomes. These work programs are reviewed annually. In addition, Departmental staff meet regularly with grantee organisations to review progress. Financial reports, independently audited, are required annually and/or at the end of a project.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Ultimately, where guidelines are breached, the Department may recommend to the Minister to cancel funding.

      <para>
       (2) The evacuation was in line with standard procedures for buildings in which chemicals or radioactive materials are handled, following a malfunction in the electrical power supply to the building and, consequently, the ventilation system. Building 54 contains handling cells for the remote manipulation of radioactive materials used in the production of medical radioisotopes. Such cells are known in the nuclear industry as ``hot cells''. The term ``hot box'' is unknown.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. Ventilation to the handling cells was restored within 15 minutes. Electrical power to the rest of the building ventilation system took a further three hours to restore.

        —The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Federal Government fully funds and maintains the National Highway system. It determines priorities and objectives for individual corridors in accordance with its five year rolling National Highway strategy. The Minister for Land Transport's statement of 4 March 1991 detailed the Federal strategy for the next five years for the Bruce Highway (Brisbane to Cairns) which forms part of the National Highway in Queensland.
      </para>
      <para>
       State road authorities act as design and construction agents on behalf of the Commonwealth. They are responsible for developing specific details of projects consistent with the Federal strategy, which are submitted to the Minister for Land Transport for his approval.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) In relation to the future upgrading of the southern approaches to Mackay, the Queensland Department of Transport has submitted a number of projects for the Minister's consideration. These are pavement overlay from Sandy Creek to Bakers Creek (about 7km) and duplication of the highway from Bakers Creek to Boundary Road (about 2.5kms).
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed works for the southern approaches to Townsville include the widening of University Road from the Flinders Highway to University Creek. Consideration of these projects by the Federal Minister is contingent upon finalisation by the Queensland Department of Transport of a review of major roads in Townsville and the need for the declaration of University Road as part of the National Highway system.
      </para>
      <para>
       Projects on a stretch of about 10 kilometres of National Highway on the southern approaches to Cairns are under consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       These include a number of sections of the Bruce Highway, namely Skeleton Creek to Roberts Road (estimated $4.1 million), Robert Road to Mackey Creek with particular attention given to Maitland Road to Mackey Creek section (estimated $1.6 million).
      </para>
      <para>
       The Robert Road to Maitland section will take in the town of Edmonton. Design and planning for the precise alignment of the highway at Edmonton including a possible need for a bypass if warranted will need to be addressed towards the latter end of the present five year forward program. A tentative figure at this stage for the proposed works is $5.4 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) (b) The Minister for Land Transport recently approved the Bohle River bridges project at a cost of $5.5 million. Further duplication works on the northern approaches to Townsville will be considered, if justified by vehicle usage, and in relation to other priorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Federal commitment to upgrade the southern approach to Townsville will be met. As indicated in (1), the Queensland Department of Transport is reviewing major roads in Townsville and as a result Queensland may recommend a new highway alignment through Townsville. It is expected the new alignment will include University Road, which will be considered by the Minister for funding as part of the National Highway in Queensland.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) See (1) &amp;(3).
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) As above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) (a) (b) Due to the prolonged ``wet'' initial flood assessments are only now being received from Queensland and is therefore not possible to indicate how much of the Bruce Highway will be rehabilitated between Ayr and Townsville under the Natural Disaster Relief arrangements or will need to be funded through the Federal National Highway program. However remedial maintenance work was undertaken on the highway as soon as conditions permitted.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is anticipated that the Ayr-Townsville section of the Bruce Highway will form part of a Queensland flood and damage assessment of the Bruce Highway expected shortly.

      <para>
       Federal road funding resources available for road rehabilitation and repairs depend upon the amount that Queensland will be able to recover under the Natural Disaster Relief arrangements. All roads including the Federally funded National Highway system in Queensland (of which the Bruce Highway is part) only qualify for Natural Disaster Relief in cases where the road suffered damage as a direct result of the natural disaster. Saturated road pavements weakened by heavy rain and suffering damage from the passage of heavy traffic have to be met from presently available Federal road funds under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was announced in the media statement of 4 March 1991 that additional road funding would be considered for damage caused by the recent wet but not eligible under the Natural Disaster Relief arrangements.

       (c) It is not possible to give accurate completion dates for all road projects on the Bruce Highway.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       On 14 March 1991 when responding to a Question Without Notice from Senator Powell, I advised the Senate that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was investigating the carriage of life rafts on Australian Airlines' aircraft. In its report to me, the CAA confirmed there was only one incident involving an Australian Airlines aircraft flying over water without the mandatory four life rafts stowed in the passenger compartment. This occurred on a flight between Melbourne and Perth, when an Australian Airlines' B737-400 aircraft, VH-TJK inadvertently carried two of the four life rafts in the cargo hold, with the remaining two life rafts correctly stowed in the passenger compartment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The CAA concluded from its investigations that, apart from the VH-TJK incident, all other Australian Airlines aircraft, including VH-TJJ were operating legally at all times over water with the required number of life rafts stowed in their passenger compartment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) &amp;(2) As stated above, there was no illegal flight undertaken by VHTJJ over water on 12 March 1991 or any other date.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) VH-TJJ undertook three flights on 12 March 1991 with three different captains, none of whom were American. In relation to flights on 10 March 1991, VH-TJJ undertook two flights, namely Melbourne/Perth and Perth/Melbourne with an American captain. The American captain has been trained in the differences between the procedures he was used to and the procedures used in Australia, both the mandatory requirements of the regulations and the requirements of the airline. The regulations concerning carriage of life rafts in airlines in the USA and Australia are basically the same.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No. On 1 March 1991, Australian Airlines introduced a new policy whereby two life rafts were to be re-located to the hold of the aircraft, in order to provide more hand luggage space in the passenger compartment. Procedures were set in place to return the two life rafts to the aircrafts' passenger compartments prior to each long over water flight. Following the incident on 10 March 1991 referred to above, the new policy was abolished and all life rafts are now re- installed in passenger compartments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No. No purpose would be served by making the maintenance releases available for VH-TJJ in view of the fact that the aircraft did not fly illegally over water.

       (1) Information on the participation rate of recipients of the Young Homeless Allowance (YHA) in DEET employment and training programs is not currently collected.

       (3) DEET is primarily concerned about the education and labour market needs of clients such as literacy and numeracy needs and lack of skills. The needs of homeless young people are being considered and analysed at the local level and courses are designed to meet their employment education and training needs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The main problems facing young homeless people who participate in, or seek to participate in, DEET programs as identified by DEET are lack of competitiveness in the labour market brought about by low levels of work skills and experience. This is often compounded by other social and personal problems.

       (3) The Department maintains four indepen- dent databases from which divisions operate direct mailing.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Communications Operations Division maintains a data base containing addresses of community and television industry organisations. These groups are provided with information on UHF television and FM radio services in their areas. The data base is located in Central Office in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       A UHF Hotline has operated since 1986 from the department's Queensland office. This hotline handles calls from all over Australia, and is able to establish three-way links with the Telephone Interpreter Service in order to assist callers who have trouble with English.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bureau of Transport and Communications has a general purpose mailing list used for despatch of publications and notices, and is used as a basis of BTCE contacts.
      </para>
      <para>
       The public affairs section of the Corporate Management division maintains a mailing list of transport and communication contacts in industry and the public, who receive ministerial and departmental press releases, reports and brochures.
      </para>
      <para>
       The public education unit of the Federal Office of Road Safety maintains a list of organisations and individuals who receive road safety information material.
      </para>
      <para>
       All four areas maintain separate mailing lists as each deals with different client groups.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Four areas of the department have undertaken direct mailing activities this financial year:
      </para>
      <para>
       For each new publication the BTCE sends up to 100 free copies, mainly unsolicited, to individuals and organisations who might have assisted in the project or have a direct interest in the results of the project. The purpose of this direct mailing is to alert the community to the work of the BTCE, rather than to increase sales of the publication. Order forms for the publication are sent to other interested parties. Costs incurred are absorbed by the funds allocated to the total project.
      </para>
      <para>
       The BTCE has developed a commercial software package, Aerocost, which simulates the cost of operating a range of commercial jet and propellor aircraft. This package is used in a wide range of policy development and research activities. It is also marketed at conferences and in trade journals for use by public and private organisations. So far about 40 copies have been sold. The possibility of marketing Aerocost overseas is being explored.
      </para>
      <para>
       In May 1991 the Bureau held a conference `A New Era in Australian Aviation' to review developments in the period leading up to, and following, domestic deregulation and to consider current international aviation issues. Flyers inviting expressions of interest were direct mailed, the conference was widely advertised in the media and attracted about 150 delegates from Australia and overseas. Registration fees for the conference were based on full cost recovery.
      </para>
      <para>
       A full list of direct mailing projects undertaken by the Federal Office of Road Safety is at Attachment 1.
      </para>

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. (a) The department considers that direct marketing is a useful method of providing information to, and affecting the attitudes of its clients. (b) The department would hope to inform, explain policy, and encourage its clients to act upon the information provided through this medium. (c) The most relevant and effective methods of direct marketing used by the department are direct mail, and direct mail reinforced by telemarketing.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The department considers that marketing strategies should integrate the various media available to it. Marketing in the department is program-based and client-oriented, and not driven by the available media. The mix of media used in a campaign is determined by the perceived effectiveness of each available medium and the optimum mix of media required in achieving the desired outcomes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. The department through the Education Student Assistance System (ESAS) maintains a mailing data-base of recipients of AUSTUDY, ABSTUDY and those in the Assistance for Isolated Children category.

         Senator Robert Ray

       <para in-line="1">
        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes; (a) General public information on the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence, and industry and general awareness of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). (b) The Department aims to improve public awareness and understanding of defence issues and believes that this cannot be achieved by relying solely on the mass media. Extensive market research has identified the use of direct marketing for public information purposes as one of the major marketing tools available to Defence. The DSTO believes that direct marketing to selected industry and specialist groups plays a central role in the commercial exploitation of DSTO expertise and assets. (c) The primary method of direct marketing of general information about the Australian Defence Force and the Defence Department is the staging of Australian Defence Force Exhibitions at Royal Agricultural Shows around Australia which involve direct contact with the Australian Public. These exhibitions often involve a recruitment component. A smaller area of effort is the mailing of a regular newsletter to target groups in industry, government and other special interest groups. The DSTO produces two publications which are sent to both specialist and more general audiences.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) While direct marketing of general public information is not grouped as a single budget item, the costs of activities outlined above are met through the Public Information Program. Expenditure in FY 1990/91 on exhibitions-excluding freight and travel/subsistence costs for staff-is $340,000 and mailing cost for the newsletter is $7566. There is no intention to have a separate direct marketing budget item as this expenditure is part of the Defence Public Information Program and is already readily identifiable. The cost of the DSTO mailing list production, handling and postage to external recipients is expected to be approximately $5550 this financial year. This figure excludes costs of mailings on-forwarded from individual DSTO laboratories. The DSTO expenditure on direct mailing is funded this financial year under the Defence Public Information Program and is readily identifiable. From 1 July 1991 it is planned that funding will come from within the DSTO budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Public Information Program has two distribution lists for distributing regular newsletters as well as data bases for disseminating information to the media. The DSTO has distribution lists for distributing its publications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Public Information Branch publication `Defence Update' is currently published bi-monthly but is intended to become a monthly publication. It is sent to approximately 1500 special interest group addresses and covers policy and operational developments in Defence. The DSTO has two publications, the `Industry Brief' and the newsletter `DSTO Research News'. The former, of which six issues per year are sent to approximately 600 selected industry addresses, provides coverage of specific DSTO developments and projects of potential industry interest. The latter, of which approximately 5500 copies are distributed quarterly, is aimed at increasing general awareness of the DSTO in industry, the media, government, academic institutions and other special interest groups.
