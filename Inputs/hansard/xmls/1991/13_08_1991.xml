       Mr President, whilst I appreciate what you have said and that hopefully later today you will be able to give to the Senate a full explanation as to what is occurring, I nevertheless remind you, with respect, of your responsibility as a Presiding Officer to ensure the proper functioning of the Senate. Today and before today, it seems, there has been disruption of the business of the Senate, in particular in regard to such aspects as the delivery of mail. I understand that constituents' mail is still not getting through in full to senators. Other services are clearly being disrupted. Senators this morning have not had the delivery of newspapers and other normal services that are necessary for the proper functioning of their responsibilities. The work of senators has clearly been disrupted and they have been questioned in matters relating to transport. There is still a question as to whether all senators are actually here today.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst my colleagues and I will be interested to hear your full and complete statement later in the day, I would appreciate it if you would at this stage advise the Senate as to what actions you have been taking up to now to ensure that these disruptions are minimised or avoided, and give us an explanation at the moment as to the extent of the disruptions taking place.

        —With respect, Mr President, there may be an industrial action-and apparently there is. You are seeking a verdict of the Industrial Relations Commission as to how that should be handled from now, but that does not answer the questions about the disruption that has occurred today. I accept that it goes beyond simply your responsibilities, in that there is now a question as to whether the police carried out their functions and responsibilities correctly this morning in their apparent protection of this picket line. There is a question of the responsibility of Comcar drivers-I would say a responsibility to be prepared to pick up senators and take them to work, not to drop them halfway between their place of overnight abode and the Parliament.

It is not a radical solution for the Parliament to demand that it be allowed to conduct its proceedings on behalf of the people of Australia without impediment, it is the right of the Parliament to do so.

Surely that is something you do not need to be briefed on between now and 2.30 p.m., or now and a later hour this day.

       Tobacco Advertising
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.

      <para>
       And your petitioners in duty bound will ever pray.

        —It seems to be an appropriate time to raise with the de facto Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan), the program for this week and this session. We had agreed to come back for this unprecedented sitting during the week before the Budget session on the basis of the weight of business before the Senate and the fact that there was an overload of business at the end of the last session. I do not think even the Government would justify that in the light of an orderly program. It was largely business that entered the parliamentary process too late. It was not dealt with and an alternative was put of the Senate sitting during July, which would have meant it was sitting during every month of this year, which was unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As a result of all those concerns, we have said-I think we may even have volunteered-that we would be prepared to sit a week earlier to facilitate the Government's program. What has happened is that the program has collapsed. We now know that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, which was to be the principal matter for debate and the matter of such great urgency for this week, is now no longer to be debated in this chamber this week. That issue is clearly going to be debated in greater length in a moment or two, but I remind you, Mr President, that we on this side of the chamber urged and moved notices of motion asking that the committee consideration of that Bill take place during the parliamentary break in order that debate could take place in an orderly way in here this week. The Government and the Australian Democrats refused that orderly process and now we come back here and find that they have changed their minds and now want to refer the legislation to a committee. So the purpose of our coming back this week, as far it relates to that piece of legislation, has been lost.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have already found that other pieces of legislation that were so important and were to be dealt with this week are now not going to be dealt with. I understand that the fisheries legislation is to be put off. Yesterday morning the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had a hearing to try to facilitate the process of the copyright legislation. It is incomplete; the Committee is now going to meet again on Thursday to try to put that in shape for debate on Friday of this week, but at this stage it must be regarded as very doubtful. The social security legislation was dealt with by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs yesterday. I understand that that was found to be wanting and that debate on that Bill is now likely not to take place for several weeks whilst matters are sorted out.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question therefore is: why are we back here this week in the light of this collapse of the Government's program? The Parliamentary Secretary might now use this brief debate to explain to the Senate what the business of the Senate is to be in the course of this week. I would ask him to put that in the context of the planned business for the whole of this parliamentary session.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have had a view for some years that finishing the parliamentary session a day or two before Christmas is unwise. There are a lot of reasons why honourable senators should be back in their electorates for a week or two before Christmas. It was hoped that with orderly programming that might be achieved this year. I remind you, Mr President, that during the period of the Fraser Government, with orderly programming, it was able to be achieved but during the period of this Government, due to its inability to put a program in reasonable order, legislation is not introduced until late in the session and the Senate finishes too late in the year.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are keen to work constructively with the Government this session to allow the Senate to get up at least a clear week before Christmas. At the moment, the Government's program has the Senate finishing the week of 21 December which, in our opinion, is too late. If the Senate had had a full program of work this week, that reasonable desire to finish a week earlier may have been met. The collapse of the program this week will make it even more difficult. I ask the Manager of Government Business to address the program for the session in the light of that reasonable desire to finish at a sensible time this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, there are a number of mechanisms that could be adopted, such as bringing forward the cut-off date, which would make it more difficult for the Government. We do not want to adopt such measures if the programming can be handled in an orderly and sensible way. We are more than happy to give an undertaking that legislation be treated in that way. We can get through much of this material more sensibly than we have been able to in the past. I want to put on the record now, at the beginning of the session, our desire to finish one week before 21 December because that is a sensible legislative process, and for no other reason.

        —I, too, would like to put on record a similar sentiment to that expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) and I welcome his comments. It is essential, if we are to get through the business of this place as it is presented before us, that we do all cooperate. My colleagues and I certainly concur with the view that the Senate should not be sitting virtually until Christmas Eve on a regular basis in the way that it has been.

      <para>
       Through you, Mr President, I would like formally in this chamber to convey to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) and the Leader of the Opposition our willingness to cooperate in the program as it proceeds throughout the year. I think it will be necessary for us continually to review progress. We are certainly willing to do that. That could lead to a better finish, an earlier finish and one that is less rushed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suggest to the Manager of Government Business that perhaps he should consider the situation for this week. Quite clearly, as Senator Hill as pointed out, we will not be dealing with some legislation this week in the way that we expected to. I notice that there are Bills on notice for introduction by Senator Tate, at least, and I would suggest that if it is the case that this week's program is not looking as busy as we expected, consideration be given to shortening the session this week. All of us have other work to do. If there is no productive work here, I suggest that we might have productive work elsewhere. At least we will be able to take our mail home with us now that we are here in Parliament House.
      </para>

       To begin this session with a spirit of cooperation is a good beginning. I simply want to acknowledge and to put on record our willingness to do that throughout the session, including this week.

        —In support of Senator Hill's remarks, in particular, I wish to refer to one matter and that is the advantage for honourable senators in having a shortened sitting in December. For at least the last 10 years I do not recall having had the opportunity to attend community functions in my electorate of South Australia during December. At the moment we are to sit, according to the schedule, for three weeks out of four in November; the Senate only is due to sit during the first two weeks of December; and presumably the House of Representatives will return while the Senate is scheduled to sit, at the moment, in the third week of December. I wish to state, I think on behalf of a number of honourable senators on both sides of the chamber, that there are a number of important community functions that occur in our electorates-the end of the school year and Christmas functions-at which members of parliament are often expected to be in attendance.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Indeed, there is a general impression during December that the Parliament has risen because the House of Representatives is not sitting in the first two weeks of December. Whilst members of the House of Representatives can attend a number of these important December functions around Australia, senators are denied that opportunity, and have been denied it for at least the last decade. I therefore very strongly support Senator Hill's suggestion that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is sitting in the chamber, gives every consideration to us being able to attend electorate functions in December.

        —in reply-I welcome the positive notes put forward in the latter part of Senator Hill's comments and in Senator Powell's contribution. This week there is still a substantial body of legislation to be dealt with. In order to facilitate the continuing smooth flow of business so that we do not have a lull now and a rush later, we have sought to initiate legislation in the Senate today. So legislation will start here and flow to the House of Representatives subsequently for this week and next week. As far as possible we wish to be cooperative in that matter and that is why those notices of motion were given this morning.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Obviously in the Budget session there is a large amount of legislation that can only be introduced in the House of Representatives and that creates a bunching of legislation. There is no alternative to that. The Appropriation Bills and taxation legislation, et cetera, are a major part of the debate. So there will inevitably be that bunching of Budget legislation. A substantial amount of Senate time is also taken by Estimates committees and consideration of legislation at the committee stage. That will also put some pressure later on.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, we are endeavouring to put as much business forward as possible in these early stages for the reasons outlined by Senator Hill and Senator Powell. In terms of the positive elements of their contribution towards seeking cooperation about programming, I would be very happy this week to convene a meeting with Senator Hill and Senator Powell and talk about programming for the rest of the session in an attempt to get some cooperative format that will expedite the program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nobody wishes to be here a day more than is necessary to pass the legislative program. I cannot give an undertaking to Senator Teague that we will achieve what he desires. Wherever I might live, I can assure him that there are many other Government senators who are as enthusiastic as he and Senator Hill to be in places other than Canberra in the week before Christmas. But I cannot give a guarantee on that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will call a meeting as soon as possible for Senator Hill and Senator Powell, where we can talk about these things and try to cooperate in getting a program that will facilitate and expedite the business of the Senate so that we can discharge our responsibilities and get home as early as possible.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 came into effect in 1984 the courts have recognised the seriousness of wildlife offences and have been imposing progressively heavier penalties on those convicted of illegally exporting and importing wildlife. This trend, together with the work being undertaken cooperatively by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS), the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, State and Federal Police, and State wildlife agencies, is making wildlife smuggling an increasingly risky business. There is also developing, through the arrangements in effect under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), an increasingly effective international cooperative effort to stem the illegal international wildlife trade. These efforts are complemented and assisted by the work of the international network of the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna In Commerce (TRAFFIC) offices. The TRAFFIC office in Australia has directly assisted the work of State and Federal Agencies, and is also to be commended for its work in helping to raise Australian awareness of wildlife smuggling.
       </para>
       <para>
        There nevertheless remains the fact that smuggling wildlife out of Australia is potentially lucrative, and in the case of illegal importations, could sow the seeds of an environmental disaster. A court recently accepted that 10 Gang Gang Cockatoos, 23 Major Mitchell's Cockatoos and 4 Musk Lorikeets that a person was attempting to smuggle out of Australia had an overseas value of US$325,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia also has a history of exotic species that have become established in the wild. Rabbits, foxes, cats, cane toads and the prickly pear have either changed, often permanently, parts of the Australian environment or been implicated in the demise of some of our native fauna. The risks to the environment of uncontrolled introduction of exotic species are clearly as great as the risks of introducing exotic diseases.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is essential that the penalties available to the courts are sufficient to deter those who would smuggle wildlife. Clearly a monetary penalty, or an insufficient custodial sentence, are not wholly effective. For example in a case brought under the Wildlife Protection Act, the presiding Judge commented that, considering the seriousness of the offence, he would have considered imposing a heavier sentence had it been available.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill therefore includes an amendment that will raise the maximum custodial penalty under the Wildlife Protection Act from 5 to 10 years, and also gives the court the option of imposing both a monetary penalty, as well as a custodial sentence.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision will also be made requiring the Designated Authority under the Act to give notice on an annual basis, inviting interested persons or groups to register their interest in commenting on any proposal for declarations of approved management programs and proposals for declarations of controlled specimens. These amendments will go a long way towards addressing the concerns that no provision was made for public comment. The only channel for public redress was to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a decision after the event, which frequently exposed the applicant to a costly and time consuming process.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exercise of controls on Australian international wildlife trade requires, in addition to a commitment to effective law enforcement, the efficient and effective administrative control of legitimate trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Wildlife Protection Act sets out the circumstances under which transactions for scientific research and zoological display may occur, and defines the circumstances under which private and commercial transactions may be permitted. Originally the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act did not fully take into account the range of circumstances under which private and commercial wildlife trade may occur, the various ways in which wildlife products are obtained, or the enormous differences in status and biology of the large number of species covered by the Act. Previous amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act largely addressed changes to administrative procedures that have improved operating efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other parts of this Bill make further changes to administrative procedures, that will improve operating efficiency without compromising the protection of wildlife and the Australian environment. These changes have largely arisen from decisions made following the review of government export controls. The amendments will allow a more case specific approach to the requirements for a management program and the type of Australian wildlife and wildlife products. The changes will not affect controls on species subject to commercial utilisation like kangaroos, or species whose status could be adversely affected if levels of utilisation were not strictly controlled, like the estuarine (saltwater) crocodile. There are however a wide range of common species that are subject to small scale utilisation, often by means that have little impact on wild populations. The Bill allows a more flexible approach towards defining the need for information on the biology of the species, and the nature and extent of controls that need to be applied to these activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Associated with these changes to assessing management programs is provision for approval of programs to be conditional. For example it will be possible to set quotas or levels of harvest. Such conditions applied to the approval of kangaroo programs will enable harvesting limits to be set in accordance with a recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes will not apply to endangered or rare species whose protection and conservation is of special ongoing concern to this Government. To address this concern the Government has established an Endangered Species Unit within ANPWS and an Endangered Species Advisory Committee (ESAC), which prepared a national strategy for the conservation of species and habitats threatened with extinction. ESAC provides an effective framework for the involvement of non-government organisations in the conservation of endangered species. The global loss of species is of increasing concern to the community, and the Endangered Species Unit and ESAC, while mainly addressing problems faced by native species, also direct their attention to Australian activities that can support conservation of endangered species in other parts of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nor will these changes alter the current ban on private and commercial export of live native fauna. The arguments of those in favour of allowing commercial export of live native birds have been well documented in the media. The review of government export controls that gave rise to these amendments also examined this issue. The Government has affirmed that relaxing current controls is unlikely to be effective and is not in the best interest of the species concerned. The ANPWS has provided funding for research on methods of protecting crops from bird damage as this problem is central to the arguments of those advocating commercial export of live birds. It is considered that developing a better understanding of the birds' biology and behaviour, and using this knowledge to vary agricultural methods, is more likely to provide long-term solutions than merely exporting birds. I am pleased to note that this approach has been wholeheartedly supported by responsible animal welfare agencies, such as the RSPCA.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also highlight that the export of wild taken birds, such as our galah and sulphur crested cockatoo, is not an answer to the pest problem. As many of my honourable colleagues will be aware, the export ban on live native birds came into effect in 1960. This ban was implemented following a conference of State and Commonwealth conservation Ministers in 1959. The meeting examined a survey on the mortality ratio of birds that were being captured for legal export. This survey concluded that of all the birds trapped, only 25 percent survived to be actually exported.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should also look at the potential market for exports of wild taken birds. It is not as great as one would imagine. There are only a few countries that can be considered as having a potential demand. The USA would be the prime market, with some European countries accepting limited quantities. For many years now, there has been international concern over the vast amounts of wild birds being traded for the pet market. It is generally recognised that wild taken birds make poor pets, and that the caging of a wild animal is not an acceptable practice. I should also point out that in the United States of America, two separate bills have recently been introduced into the US Congress that relate to the importation of wild birds. These bills call for a phase out of the importation of wild-caught birds for the pet trade. One version of the USA bill calls for a 5 year phase out, while the other version calls for an end to imports of wild caught birds for the pet market after one year. Although there is no indication as to the success of these bills, which are anticipated to be debated some time over the next few months, the implication is clear: there is to be a gradual elimination of trade in wild taken birds.
       </para>
       <para>
        To that end, the Wildlife Amendment Bill also tightens controls on the export of birds as household pets by providing for an upper limit on the number of birds that may be taken out of Australia by a person leaving to take up permanent residence overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally the Bill proposes a number of amendments to streamline administration. These include a definition of the meaning of `transhipment', which is tightened to prevent importers from using Australia as a holding area for wildlife products taken out of other countries while they arrange buyers and delivery. Another amendment will allow people in remote areas to export wildlife products without prior presentation of the original permit to a Customs Officer or inspector. Such exporters must, however, receive the permission of the ANPWS before doing so. A further amendment enables the Minister to delegate to the Designated Authority the power to grant an authority under section 44 in exceptional circumstances. The grant of such authorities is subject to public review. The other amendments concern cross referencing of terms within the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the continuing loss of global biological diversity, the depletion of the ozone layer, the pollution of our atmosphere and oceans and the associated greenhouse effect is wearing away the fabric of the intricate biological web that sustains-life on this planet. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 is part of a global network of legislation, with the ultimate objective to ensure that our utilisation of wildlife and ecosystems is sustainable. The amendments proposed in this Bill support that objective, give the flexibility that is essential to its effective administration, and increase its strength in deterring illegal wildlife trafficking.

         —The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 can fairly be described as an omnibus Bill which seeks to amend various Acts concerned with crime, law enforcement and criminal justice. The Acts that this Bill seeks to amend are: the Australian Federal Police Act 1979; the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988; the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987; the Crimes Act 1914; the Passports Act 1938; the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989; the National Crime Authority Act 1984; and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would like to deal briefly with some of the more high profile amendments which the Bill seeks to make. There is an extension of the witness protection scheme so that it includes persons other than witnesses who are in need of protection by reason of their association with the relevant witness. This is in relation to the amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        One amendment that deserves specific mention is the amendment which provides that, where a determination has not been made with respect to the compensation payable to a staff member upon early termination-that is, where that determination was not made at the time of appointment-the Commissioner may make such determination at the time of the termination as is essential. I draw attention to that particular amendment because it provides the opportunity for abuse in the form of retrospective golden handshakes. There is the additional point to make-that the Federal Police should be obliged to ensure that these determinations are made at the time of appointment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the Cash Transaction Reports Act, the more substantive amendments deal with the protection given to cash dealers for incorrect reports of suspect transactions under section 16. Obviously, the proper functioning of the Cash Transaction Reports Act is essential in the network of legislation to get at organised crime, and it has always been the intention that cash dealers acting in good faith would be protected.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this point it is worth raising a query which the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) may care to deal with. As I understand it, the phrase `mistaken belief' is wider than some people imagine, and this could cause some problems. The Bill seeks to impose on cash dealers an obligation of confidentiality, non-compliance with which will constitute a criminal offence. It will be an exception for a cash dealer to disclose such information, either pursuant to the terms of the Act or to a court by way of evidence. Perhaps this deserves to be queried. No provision is made, as I understand it, to allow cash dealers to make such disclosures to legal representatives in the preparation of court proceedings. At the moment only the Cash Transaction Reports Agency is allowed to make such disclosures.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are alterations to the obligations of cash dealers for keeping records so that they can retain copies, including microfiche, rather than the original records. The coalition would appreciate a comment from the Minister in relation to this matter, and specifically as to how such a change will affect the best evidence rule in relation to the production of original documents for court proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, the cash transaction reports information will be allowed to be passed to the Attorney-General for the purposes of transmitting that information to a foreign country-obviously not at the whim of the Attorney-General, but under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. The Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland are added as law enforcement bodies which may have access to CTR information. That is obviously an important amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency is to provide an annual report as soon as practicable after 30 June. That is a good thing, on the one hand; but, on the other, the Minister may care to give an explanation as to why the Director is not required to give a report at some nominated time. That does not seem too much to ask. There are plenty of other bodies that have a specific limitation put on them in that respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the amendments to the Crimes Act, a private member's Bill was put forward by Mr Peacock in December 1990 which vanished into thin air and which was moved as an amendment to part 4 when the Bill went through the House of Representatives, and the same will be happening in the committee stage here. That presented an opportunity for the Government to take up some of the amendments from the fourth interim report of the Criminal Law Review Committee, but they just were not acceded to by the Government. It seems now to be proceeding in somewhat of a piecemeal fashion. That is not to say that these things do not need to be done, but no adequate explanation was given for not adopting those proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are further amendments to the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act, to the Customs Act and to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Then, in part 8 of the Bill, there are amendments to the National Crime Authority Act 1984. These amendments are designed to allow the ACT Government to participate in the Inter-governmental Committee, which is responsible, as the Minister obviously knows, for references to the Authority. This change will be a good thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is probably appropriate to mention at this stage, though, that it is public knowledge that the Inter-governmental Committee has made the recommendation that the Joint Parliamentary Committee to oversee the National Crime Authority be abolished. In that respect, I am pleased to say that there has been some progress in that the Joint Parliamentary Committee to oversee the National Crime Authority has met informally with the Inter-governmental Committee, and I do not think it is inappropriate to say that some of the misunderstandings and misconceptions, in my view, held by the IGC have been alleviated, and there will be further meetings to see what possibility there is of getting some common ground. So, in that sense, I seek to make some positive remarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, I cannot resist the opportunity of saying how extraordinary it is that a body of State Ministers should purport to suggest to this Parliament that a committee set up by this Parliament to oversee a body set up by this Parliament should be abolished because in some way it makes it difficult for the life of a State Minister to carry on. When one looks at the history of the National Crime Authority- I do not want to take up a lot of time on this matter, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I am sure that you understand- one cannot say that it has an unblemished history. If one were a member of the public looking to see just what it is that the Inter-governmental Committee has done by way of supervision of this Authority, one would be at a loss to see what accountability it has.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can recall a specific instance in South Australia where a question was put to the State Attorney-General, Mr Sumner, who, incidentally, is a member of the IGC, and his response was to this effect: `Well, if one wanted to know something about the National Crime Authority, one could go to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and ask the question'. Yet here, in another forum, Mr Sumner feels no difficulty in saying that that Committee should be abolished, in part, I suppose, because he and others see that the lines of accountability are confused by that Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make it abundantly clear that is not the coalition's view. One needs only to turn back to the Hansard record at the time the National Crime Authority was established to see what role this Parliament saw for the Joint Parliamentary Committee, what role this Parliament saw for the IGC and how this Parliament saw that those two bodies were needed as separate bodies and how they could coexist.
       </para>
       <para>
        It might be appropriate, other than to make a small reference to the amendments that we are going to make, to leave it at that. The coalition will be moving eight amendments when we get to the committee stage: amendments Nos 1 to 3 together as a group if it is the wish of the Committee of the Whole House to do so, since they all sensibly belong together. Those amendments deal primarily with section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act to ensure that there is a clearer-and by that I mean narrower-definition of just what it is that an officer needs to report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation at the moment is that cash dealers have to make reports when they form a view or suspect that the information available to them says that there may be a contravention of a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory. This requirement is obviously very broad. The obligation imposed by section 16, consequently, is very broad because there is such a wide range of offences. As my colleague Mr Peacock put it in a debate in the House of Representatives:
       </para>
       <para>
        The obligations imposed by section 16 relate to a wide range of offences, from the most trivial to the most serious.
       </para>
       <para>
        As he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment seeks to confine those obligations to information which may be relevant to a serious offence as defined.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, in responding to those amendments moved by Mr Peacock, indicated that the Government would not accept those amendments. The reason he gave was that it would require every cash dealer to be some sort of specialist in the law of the Commonwealth, in criminal law, to make some sort of assessment as to whether the information he had indicated that there may be contravention of this defined category of serious offence, but that is not an adequate argument to reject these amendments. The reason it is not adequate is this: if a cash dealer has the competence to recognise over the breadth of section 16 the range of offences that may be contravened, a cash dealer has the capacity to recognise a smaller range of offences. I think that is the point. The breadth of section 16 at the moment means that a cash dealer has to have some knowledge of a very broad range of offences, and the coalition is seeking to narrow down the range of offences that a cash dealer would need to have some knowledge of. On that basis I say that the Attorney-General's answer is inadequate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second group of amendments to be moved-that is, amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8-are somewhat more substantive than the first three. Amendment No. 4 seeks to amend section 3 of the Crimes Act by adding at the end of the definition of `Commonwealth officer' a reference to agents of the Commonwealth for the purpose of proposed new sections 54, 55 and 56. Those proposed sections are contained within amendment No. 5, which in turn can be divided into two parts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment No. 5 seeks to introduce into the Bill new clauses 21a and 21b. Clause 21a seeks to repeal sections 31 to 44 of the Crimes Act and to substitute new provisions relating to the administration of justice. Clause 21b seeks to insert into the Crimes Act a new part 4 dealing with bribery and corruption. Amendments Nos 6, 7, and 8 are consequential amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to bribery and corruption, it is a matter of particular note that the Government has expressed, through its support for a Bill to ban political advertising, the need to rid the political process of corruption. In relation to that, the coalition has said that there has been no evidence of the cost of advertising leading to the corruption of public officials and, on that ground, the Government's support for that particular Bill does not stand up. It has further said that, in any event, the limitation on political freedom of expression is unsatisfactory.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the coalition has never said, however, is that it has no concern whatsoever about corruption of public officials. One simply could not contemplate any party in this chamber saying that it had no concern about that particular matter. My colleague Mr Peacock, in the other place, in December 1990 presented a Bill, the tenor of which these amendments reflect. His concern was to very much modernise the criminal laws of the Commonwealth relating to bribery and corruption of judicial officers, parliamentarians and public servants.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Peacock raised a number of matters at the time, one of which I will leave and the other I will mention at this stage. He pointed out that the report of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption exposed a mysterious network of financiers, developers, Australian Labor Party figures and Federal public servants operating with respect to land developments. He went on to say that one former senior adviser to a Federal Minister, riddled with conflicts of interest, formed the subject of a secret and separate report for his abuse of office.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should not need more than a simple explanation as to why the Government purports to be interested in ridding the system of any corruption that may exist and purports to say that that is one of its priorities, yet offers as an explanation for not accepting these amendments simply that the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, when responding to these amendments in May-not responding to the original private member's Bill put forward by Mr Peacock-gave a whole lot of reasons why the Government had not got around to a number of things and said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Once certain principles are reformed and formulated, the recommendations in the fourth interim report, including those concerning bribery and corruption, may need further review.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does seem somewhat inconsistent to have a government saying that it believes corruption is so much at risk of tainting the political process that it is justified in looking at banning the freedom of political expression, and that it is justified in suggesting to Australian voters that they should go to an election and get their unedited political information only from the print media, and be satisfied with the editing by the electronic media-that is, not be able to hear unedited political views over the electronic air waves.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is so determined to do something about corruption of public officials-or, at least, of parliamentarians-that it feels justified in taking that course of action but, when it comes to looking at implementing some of the recommendations of the Gibbs Committee, all the Government can say is, `When we get around to it, some of the recommendations in that report, including those concerning bribery and corruption, may need further review'. It somewhat drains the Government's interest in getting at bribery and corruption, not only in terms of where it may exist in the political process relating to parliamentarians, but also in relation to public officers and members of the judiciary.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the evil that Mr Peacock sought to get at in his private member's Bill. It is the evil that the coalition seeks to do something about by moving these amendments. On that basis, I believe both groups of amendments should be supported, namely, the first group to narrow the offences which cash dealers need to deal with in reporting suspect transactions and, secondly, the whole package of amendments put forward by Mr Peacock in the other place.

         —The Senate is debating the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). This is an omnibus Bill encompassing amendments to various Acts concerned with crime, law enforcement and criminal justice. There are technical and policy amendments which the Australian Democrats do not oppose. However, as indicated in the past, the Australian Democrats will continue to monitor the operation of certain pieces of legislation amended by this Bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Part 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to extend the scope of the witness protection scheme. We are supportive of that. Part 2 also seeks to make improvements to a provision concerning management initiated retirement. On this point, the Opposition raised the concern that if any arrangements are to be made for compensation, they should be made at the time of appointment. Certainly, that is the principle that should be followed. However, I am persuaded by the explanation given by Mr Duffy, the Attorney-General, suggesting that this amendment will cover the eventuality where the initial appointment has been invalidly made. I believe it is useful to plug that particular gap.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 3 and part 7 of the Bill amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Mutual Assistance In Criminal Matters Act 1987 respectively. The amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act will clarify and improve the efficiency of the various statutory processes involved in the reporting of transactions under the Act. In particular, the amendments will permit access to information obtained under the Cash Transaction Reports Act to be granted to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland and the Attorney-General, for the purpose of responding to a request for assistance from the foreign country to which the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 applies.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Senate is aware, the Australian Democrats did not support this Act originally because of concerns about privacy protection and the likely effectiveness of the Act. Those concerns remain a high priority in our ongoing review of the operation of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. The requirement under these amendments for the Director of the Agency to furnish an annual report on the operations of the Agency to the Minister is a useful step in this regard. The review of the Act recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and mentioned by the Attorney-General in the second reading speech will also be helpful.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the other amendments are in part 4 and part 9 which will amend the Crimes Act and the Passports Act 1938 respectively. These amendments will introduce a procedure to ensure the effective operation of the existing power of the Minister to cancel or refuse passports to persons charged with or convicted of serious offences, particularly drug offences. These parts, as well as amendments in parts 5 and 6 relating to the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act and the Customs Act, are supported by the Democrats without comment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 8 of the Bill proposes amendments to the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to allow participation in the IGC by the ACT Government. I would like to take this opportunity, as Senator Vanstone has, to comment briefly on the matter that has arisen in discussions between the IGC, the NCA and the Joint Committee on the NCA. I note in passing how extraordinary it is that the IGC should suggest that the Joint Committee should be abolished when this is the very mechanism that has been provided by parliament to ensure proper supervision of the NCA. Like Senator Vanstone, I point to the fact that the record of the NCA has not been without blemish in the past. We look forward to a decisive improvement under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Phillips.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly the task of supervising the activities of the NCA remains for the Joint Committee. It is on the record that this work has been considerably hampered in the past by the secrecy provisions which have been used on occasion to withhold information which I believe the Committee required to carry out its work effectively. In this context, I welcome in particular the comments made in the other House by the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock. He acknowledges Mr Justice Phillips's support for the principle that section 51 of the Act-in other words, the secrecy provisions-should not apply to the Joint Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is the subject of a private member's Bill introduced by Senator Crichton-Browne. I am pleased to express support for the principle expressed; in fact, my own Bill repeats that provision and takes it considerably further by suggesting that there are necessary amendments to section 55(2), but beyond that it accepts the principle, which is also mentioned in the shadow Attorney-General's speech, that, if Committee members are to be given access to confidential information from the NCA, in turn they must accept a certain obligation to keep confidential information which has been divulged to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this situation the difficulty arises where there is a difference of opinion between the NCA and the Joint Committee on the NCA as to whether a particular piece of legislation should be divulged, should be used in public or whether it should, on the basis of certain principles such as the assistance it might give to criminal elements, be kept confidential and not divulged. The contrary argument is that the Joint Committee on the NCA is charged with the duty to press for remedial action, not only to monitor the work of the Committee but also to suggest to the Attorney-General any remedial action that is needed. His Honour Mr Justice Phillips suggests that a judicial arbiter might be used here should such a conflict arise.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note these suggestions with a great deal of satisfaction. In substance at least they appear to mirror fairly closely the provisions I put down in my private member's Bill dealing with these matters. The comments made by Mr Justice Phillips and the comments of the shadow Attorney-General in the other place, including his submission to the Committee's inquiry, augur well for agreement to be reached. I trust that appropriate legislation will not be too far away.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 10 makes several other minor amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act. The Australian Democrats have no further comment to make on that. The Opposition amendments are not supported by the Australian Democrats. While some of the contents, which basically arise from the Gibbs review, may be acceptable, this is a quite inappropriate context in which to adopt virtually a whole new Bill, a whole new direction for criminal law in Australia. As I said, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting these amendments.

         —With your indulgence, Madam Acting Deputy President, I briefly want to touch upon a couple of matters which you canvassed during your speech. I also want to comment on something Senator Spindler referred to. Madam Acting Deputy President, I will take up the point you made in respect of the submission of the Inter-governmental Committee; that is, the Joint Committee monitoring the National Crime Authority be abolished. With respect, I find that to be breathtaking in its audacity. The NCA does not have a healthy history since its formation; it does not have an unchequered past. The fact that it is subject to an audit by our Committee, and has been subject to other audits, reflects upon the general unhappiness that has prevailed during its existence. That is not meant as a criticism but, I trust, as an objective analysis.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I suspect we all understand that one of the problems with the NCA from the outset was that whatever our side of politics promised in respect of law and order, the ante was upped by the Government, which caused us, in a political sense, to up it also. The level of expectation as to its pursuit of criminality in Australia was much higher than that which could be achieved in the short term. I suspect the community imagined that with the setting up of the NCA we would see all these `Mr Bigs' brought to justice. Of course, the NCA was never, I hope, intended to deal in the short term with corruption and criminality in Australia, but was to deal with a long term endemic problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, in many respects the IGC has been the supervisory body of the NCA. The fact that the NCA has had many problems in many respects is a reflection upon the competence of the IGC. Again, I trust that to be an objective judgment and not a subjective criticism.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am reminded that the IGC is made up of State police Ministers. I will not go into the effectiveness of the various police Ministers' supervision of their own portfolios and their own police forces in great length, but I will dwell for a moment upon the performance of the various State police forces. My own State immediately comes to mind. It was not that long ago when the Commissioner of Police, Mr Bull, bugged the Deputy Commissioner, Mr Peters. I have never been certain why, but when the most senior law enforcement man in the police force is surreptitiously having his second in command under surveillance, one wonders whether all is well in Camelot. Without retracing all the problems of the WA Police Force over the years--

         —Perhaps that is symptomatic. The record shows that the Queensland Police Commissioner has been put in gaol for 14 years for receiving bribes. He is not the only one. There is a long list of police officers in Queensland who have failed to discharge their duties and responsibilities honestly and honourably. It may not be a reflection upon the police Minister, but it is a statement of fact as to the state of the police force. New South Wales has had more than its share of problems with the police force. The greatest problem there was to find a police commissioner who was honest and, having found one, the State Government was terrified he would retire as another one could not be found. Yet these various State police Ministers have the impertinence to suggest that the Federal Parliament does not have a role in examining and supervising, in even a very superficial way, the conduct of the National Crime Authority-a creature of Federal legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We can go to the other States. There seem to be a few problems in Tasmania at the moment, if my memory serves me correctly. I seem to recall that a very senior police officer in South Australia was gaoled for trafficking in prohibited substances. There have been more than a few problems in Victoria. I find it amazing that these police Ministers collectively suggest that they have some greater ability or capacity to supervise the NCA, given the history of their own States and the history thus far of the NCA. I hope that they will desist from that absurd proposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a suggestion that part of their motive was tied to what they described as the release of some in camera evidence. It is not a complaint made by the NCA itself; it is not an objection that Justice Phillips, the new Chairman, has expressed. Frankly, although they are not members of parliament, I am staggered that their understanding of the workings and the processes of the Federal Senate are so barren that they made that observation-not, I hope, in prejudice, but simply in stupid ignorance. If they can find something in the in camera evidence which was tabled that compromises the conduct, activities or responsibilities of the NCA, it is best they put up or shut up. As I say, I hope it was said without having an understanding of, or a capacity to understand, the workings of this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter I want to refer to is the question of the secrecy provisions. Before doing so, I should say that I do not reflect upon the NCA in a contemporary way. I think the new directions and the way in which Justice Phillips has assumed his responsibilities, with his understanding of the steps that are required to be taken, have led us all to observe that we will see-and we are already seeing-a vastly different National Crime Authority which has a relationship with the Joint Standing Committee totally different from that which has thus far been demonstrated.

        The point of having reviews is to learn from the past and assist the NCA in its own considerations. To that extent, I believe that, without exception, the manner in which Justice Phillips has dealt with the Joint Parliamentary Committee in respect of disclosures and the providing of information has been very helpful, very free and very frank. As I understand it, it is a very comfortable relationship which has not required a compromise by either us or the NCA. In fact, I think that relationship has led to a much greater understanding and sensitivity on the part of both bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Spindler is right: these sorts of structures and relationships have to be formalised and not based on individual goodwill. Senator Spindler knows that he has my support for the general direction which he is proposing in respect formalising the disclosure of certain information. Frankly, in my view the secrecy provisions of the Act have not been used in the spirit that was intended; rather, the Act has been used as a bar to deny the Committee proper and legitimate information.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure that if the proposals which I have reflected upon and which Senator Spindler has refined are dealt with, they will guarantee a much better supervision and understanding of the NCA. Also, the effectiveness of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority should be enhanced.

         —in reply-Madam Acting Deputy President, I thank you and Senator Spindler for indicating the support of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for the passage of this important Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. I would like to comment on one or two of the main features of this legislation before we put the second reading motion to the chamber.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A very important part of the necessary armoury for any society combating organised crime is, of course, to be able to offer protection to those witnesses who are courageous enough to bring forth information and good intelligence for law enforcement agencies and, perhaps, to take the role of a witness in a trial, thereby exposing themselves to considerable danger. In that situation, it is incumbent on this Government, with the support of the Parliament, to provide the maximum protection possible to such courageous persons. I believe that allowing for an extension of that offer of protection-for example, to those who are related to a witness and who themselves might be in danger-is a very sound amendment; it is one which will ensure that the detection, investigation and prosecution of major crime figures in Australia can continue in a way which does not leave in real jeopardy the families of those who offer to assist.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the Bill in a main way deals with the Cash Transaction Reports Act. That Act requires cash dealers to report to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency those transactions where the dealer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the cash transaction has relevance to tax evasion, a Commonwealth offence or the enforcement of the Proceeds of Crime Act. This is extremely important in terms of pursuing the money trail.
       </para>
       <para>
        The old type of policing meant waiting for a crime to occur and trying to gather evidence to find out who did it. The new method, in relation to the huge flows of money that are generated by drug trafficking and some forms of major fraud and tax evasion, is to look for unexplained large amounts of money in banks, credit unions, building societies, casino accounts and so on. If there is not an apparent legitimate business generation of those moneys, perhaps one may point in the direction of an organised crime figure.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, following the money trail is extremely important. It is very important that cash dealers report when they form a reasonable suspicion that a cash deposit might be relevant to a Commonwealth offence, a proceeds of crime offence or tax evasion. In that situation it is important to protect, for example, the bank teller. This was mentioned by Senator Vanstone. Section 16(5) of the Act provides protection against legal proceedings for cash dealers in relation to any action they take to fulfil this reporting requirement that the Parliament imposes on them. A leading firm of solicitors has raised a question as to whether, if all the pre-conditions set out in section 16(1) are not absolutely meticulously fulfilled, the cash dealer may not be able to claim the protection against legal action contained in section 16(5). This may be relevant where a teller is mistaken as to whether the transaction is relevant to tax evasion, a law of the Commonwealth or a State offence. It would be most unfortunate if the teller were placed in a difficult position in that regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Director of the Agency has written to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) concerning the matter. Whilst the solicitor's advice does not accord with the best advice available to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, it is thought that, because of the concern it is causing in some banks, it may be well to put the matter beyond doubt by putting forward this amendment. That is what we are attempting to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, in relation to the following of the money trail by the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, which is so important, we have to recognise that that money trail may extend beyond the Australian jurisdiction. You would be well aware from sitting on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority of the fact that money laundering, such an important facet and underpinning activity of organised criminal activity, knows no national boundaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the amendment proposed in this Bill, if the Attorney-General is satisfied that a foreign country has given appropriate undertakings as to confidentiality and control of the information, he can communicate certain information relating to the money trail to that foreign country. This would depend upon the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 which has already been well canvassed in this Parliament and is part of that international framework now which is emerging and greatly strengthening the hand of governments determined to wipe out organised criminal activity when it spills over from one national territory to another.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also amends the Act to enable the Agency to give access to information to a wider range of domestic law enforcement agencies; namely, the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. They need also to have the ability to investigate financial information and to conduct financial investigations particularly in relation to corruption. It is is a very real concern of all of us, and the Opposition has expressed that concern forcibly today. The investigative functions of those bodies will be greatly assisted by access to CTR information. I understand Mr Goss and Mr Greiner have written to the Government requesting that extension be undertaken; that will be done in this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, in relation to this Agency, the Bill contains a provision requiring the Director to provide the Attorney-General with an annual report on the operations of the Agency. I did not quite understand Senator Vanstone's point in so far as it is clear that the Director of the Agency, as soon as practicable after 30 June each year, must make a report. That has to be then tabled within 15 parliamentary sitting days of the reception by the Attorney-General of the report. I think that might satisfy Senator Vanstone. I think she wanted a more rigid timetable in relation to reporting.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill also amends provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act which allow for certain matters to be undertaken there. It amends the National Crime Authority Act to give the ACT Government the same status as the State and Northern Territory governments. This will allow it to participate in the activities of the Inter-governmental Committee. In relation to that, Mr Acting Deputy President, you left the chair to make a well-modulated intervention in the debate. But you were, unfortunately, because of electorate duties, unable to attend the discussions held on 25 July between the Inter-governmental Committee and the Joint Committee on the issues raised in the submission of the IGC to the PJC.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can assure you they were held in extremely good spirit and were very constructive. Further discussions, I understand, will be held on 24 October in Melbourne between the two committees. From my observation of the conduct of that consultation between the two important committees, we are in a situation where Australian democratic values in relation to this extraordinarily powerful agency can be asserted. It is very important that, where we have a body such as the National Crime Authority vested with powers to compel answers and the production of documents, which conducts its hearings in private in order to assemble admissible evidence for legal proceedings to be conducted by the Directors of Public Prosecution, and exercising those sorts of powers, it does not get out of the control of the elected representatives of the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that between the Inter-governmental Committee, where we have those Ministers responsible in all the jurisdictions of Australia meeting, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee, one has a sufficient array of such protection on behalf of the people. The question of the demarcation between the proper role of each of those committees is of course the very substance of those discussions which are being conducted in a very good spirit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I mention the amendments. As a result of the initiatives of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Bill contains amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Passports Act which are designed to render more effective the existing power of the Minister under the Passports Act to cancel or refuse to issue a passport to persons charged with or convicted of a serious narcotics offence or other prescribed offence against a Commonwealth or Territory law. That is most important also.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe I have outlined sufficiently the purpose of the Bill. I hope that it will have a reasonably speedy passage. I commend the second reading to the chamber.

As it is now clear that the Democrats do not wish to support any of those amendments there seems little purpose in dividing them into those two groups so as to give the Democrats that opportunity. Given the time constraint on us and the desire of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and of all honourable senators to get this legislation passed and to move on to the next piece of legislation and possibly get that done before lunchtime, the coalition would be happy to move its amendments in one block. I seek leave to move the eight amendments together.

         —I would like to indicate very briefly the Government's opposition to these amendments. In relation to the amendments proposed by the Opposition to the Cash Transaction Reports Act we do not believe that they will have the desired effect of limiting the scope of what is required to be reported because it still leaves the large area of tax evasion and the Proceeds of Crime Act matters which a cash dealer has to be concerned with.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government's main opposition to these amendments is that the Opposition's amendments specify a large number of State offences, for example, murder and kidnapping, which are beyond the reach of Commonwealth criminal law, and I am not quite certain of the capacity of the dealers to deal with those matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Director of the Agency has refined the guidelines for cash dealers to assist them in reporting suspect transactions. These guidelines now emphasise major corporate offences, money laundering and drug trafficking. It is a more appropriate response to focus suspect reporting on major crime than I believe the Opposition amendment, if it were carried, would achieve.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to matters arising from the private member's Bill of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) on crimes, bribery and corruption matters, it is substantially based on the fourth interim report of the Gibbs Committee of Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law. It should be noted that the Gibbs Committee found existing laws adequate to deal with the offering and acceptance of bribes in circumstances involving a corrupt discharge of official duties or a corrupt failure to perform official duties under the existing applicable principles of criminal responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once these principles are reformed and reformulated, the recommendations in the fourth interim report, including those as to bribery and corruption, may need further review. However, in so far as what is proposed to be done relies on the criminal responsibility recommendations contained in the third report, quite frankly the Government is not yet in a position, given the way in which matters of criminal responsibility are being discussed between the Commonwealth and the States-and very fruitfully, I may say-to support the implementation of the matters in the fourth report at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the Opposition's Bill is drafted on the premise of a set of principles of criminal responsibility that not only differ from the present scheme of Commonwealth criminal law, but also may not be enacted, at least in their current form. It is mainly on those grounds that the Government is unable to support these particular amendments. However, I may say that the Government looks forward to the continued work of various inter-jurisdictional conferences. I spoke at a dinner in Brisbane in relation to one in April, focusing on the principles of criminal responsibility. I believe there is a real possibility-and it is a great challenge to this Federation-that the basis for a uniform Australian criminal code could be emerging. I believe that is worth pursuing and that such a major reform ought not be tackled piecemeal and indirectly, as would be the case were this set of Opposition amendments to be carried.

         —The coalition supports the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill 1991, which is about the service of subpoenas and warrants. However, this legislation involves an extraordinary saga for which I hope the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) can offer some explanation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister will well know that back in 1982 the then Acting Attorney-General, the Hon. Neil Brown, QC, gave the Australian Law Reform Commission a reference to examine the operation of the principal Act. The Commission was asked specifically to consider whether the Act should be extended to cover administrative tribunals. That was back in 1982; in 1987 the Law Reform Commission report No. 40 on the service and execution of process was released.
       </para>
       <para>
        We find that on 24 August 1990-a little under a year ago-the Attorney-General, Mr Michael Duffy, announced that new procedures were to be introduced for the conduct of interstate implementation of that particular report. He said that the Government had agreed to repeal and replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901, and that it had agreed to do so following consideration of recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on the service and execution of process. So the situation is that in 1982 the then Acting Attorney-General of a coalition government referred this matter to the Law Reform Commission; in 1987 the Law Reform Commission reported and a little less than a year ago the present Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Duffy, said, `Yes, we have considered what the Law Reform Commission had to say; we are going to repeal the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901 and we are going to replace it'. He went on to outline some of the significant reforms that he thought would be undertaken as a consequence of picking up the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission reporting on a reference given to it in 1982 by a coalition government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we find that irrespective of what was said last year and irrespective of the fact that this Government on many occasions-as honourable senators who serve on delegated legislation committees or who serve, as I do, on the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills will know-expects people to rely on government by press release. Frequently we find that press releases are put out saying that as of tomorrow or next week a law is going to change in this or that particular way, and members of the public should be on notice from that time that is what the law will be. It may take months for the Government to produce that legislation and if, when it does produce it, anyone says, `Oh, this is retrospective legislation because you are purporting to change people's rights and responsibilities by changing the law back to the date of the press release', the Government says, `Oh no, you can't say that because no-one is disadvantaged; they were all put on notice by virtue of the press release that the law was going to change'. So while the law may not have changed at day one, the public knew it was going to change and so they were not disadvantaged. Therefore, it is acceptable and satisfactory-as the Government has frequently said in its nine and a bit years of office, as it dwindles into its last year-for the Government to issue a press release saying it is going to do something and we should all rely on it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Had we relied on the Attorney-General's press release of 24 August last year, today we would be expecting to deal with the total repeal of the Service and Execution of Process Act and its replacement, and we are not dealing with that. Quite simply we are dealing with an amendment. The Government has decided that it is all too hard to do what it bravely announced 12 months ago it was going to do and what it supposedly got some credit for among those who would like to see law reform proceeding; now the Government is saying, `It is all a bit hard and difficult, and we have a bit too much to do so we will just do a bit of it'. That is typical of the piecemeal fashion in which this Government approaches so many matters. That is why the coalition supports this Bill, because at least what it is doing is not a bad thing. The coalition is saying that it feels the legislation does not go far enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now take the opportunity to foreshadow that on behalf of the Opposition a large number of amendments will be moved en bloc, which are designed to supplement the provisions of this Bill. Pursuant to paragraph 51(xxiv) of the Constitution, the Commonwealth has the power to make laws with respect to the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States. Under this power, the first Commonwealth Government passed the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901, which applies only to courts. This Bill amends that Act to provide for interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals. These are defined in the Bill to be a person appointed by the Governor of a State or under State law or a body established under State law for the purpose of inquiring into and reporting on any matter but do not include a court or a judge, magistrate, coroner or court officer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under this Bill, the Supreme Court of a State or Territory will be able to give leave to serve interstate a subpoena requiring attendance at, or provision of documents or things to, an investigative tribunal. A Supreme Court will also be able to authorise the interstate apprehension of a person who has failed to comply with such a subpoena. Pursuant to proposed section 19e, it will be permissible to produce or serve a copy of a document. Before a court can give leave for a subpoena to be served interstate it must be satisfied that the evidence sought is relevant and cannot reasonably be obtained from a person within the State.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Service and Execution of Process Act provides for the service of initiating process for civil and criminal proceedings in State or Territory courts outside the State or Territory concerned; the service of other process in proceedings throughout Australia; the execution of other warrants for the apprehension of persons throughout Australia; and the recognition and enforcement of judgments, given by a court of one State or Territory, in another. The Act applies only to courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Acting Deputy President, as I said before you took the chair, this matter was referred to the Law Reform Commission in 1982, whose report was issued in June 1987. The Commission expressed the view that the Act should be modernised and that its reach should be extended to investigative and adjudicative tribunals. It also made recommendations about the manner in which interstate process should be served and about appropriate safeguards in relation to such service.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have pointed out previously, in August last year the Attorney-General announced his intention to implement the Commission's recommendations. But this Bill simply does not do that. It deals only with the recommendations relating to interstate service of process for investigative tribunals. These new procedures would be available for inquiries such as royal commissions in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria; for the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales; and the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland.
       </para>

        It is interesting to note that of all the Law Reform Commission's recommendations the Government has chosen to implement only those which are somewhat controversial. They are controversial because it is arguable whether the Commonwealth has the power to make a law about service and execution of process in relation to investigative tribunals under section 51(xxiv) of the Constitution, given that this placitum refers specifically to courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is of the view that it would be preferable to introduce the entirety of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. We are therefore proposing amendments to achieve that aim. Our amendments provide for the provisions relating to investigative tribunals to commence immediately, and for the remaining provisions to commence one year later in order to allow sufficient time for community consultation.
       </para>

        I would appreciate it if, in the speeches of the Australian Democrats and the Minister in responding, they could give an explanation as to why this matter ought to be proceeded with now, but not the other matters put forward by the Law Reform Commission. A little less than a year ago, the Government took the opportunity to get itself some publicity and announced that it was going to go ahead with these recommendations, and now it purports to proceed with only part of them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason given by the Attorney-General-if I am correct-is that because of the Government's heavy legislative program the replacement Bill will not be ready for introduction until the next sitting. The Minister knew about this in August last year. We still cannot go ahead with the whole thing so we are going to do it bit by bit. What is the Government's explanation for not being ready with the whole thing and what is the Democrat's explanation for not supporting the changes that would implement the Law Reform Commission's recommendations?

         — The Senate is debating the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill 1991 which provides for interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals. The Bill, which the Australian Democrats support, originated from the Australian Law Reform Commission report of 1987 entitled Service and Execution of Process which dealt with the adequacy of the law relating to the service and execution of the civil and criminal process throughout the Commonwealth, and the judgments in the current courts of the States and Territories. A perceived need for streamlining the interstate process was also part of the basis for inquiry and consideration of the desirability of extending the provisions of the Act to cover tribunals which carry out adjudicative or investigative functions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I share Senator Vanstone's concern that the Government is not ready to introduce a Bill to implement all of the ALRC recommendations. However, this is a factual situation. I believe it would be premature to support now the amendments proposed by the Opposition. We have had advice that there would be some difficulties with the implementation of those amendments as they stand, so the Australian Democrats prefer to wait until the next session of Parliament when the Government will be ready to replace the present Bill with one which is thought through and carefully drafted to meet its requirements. We also accept that this amendment is an urgent one and we believe it should be supported.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill proposes to insert a new part 3a into the Act to enable royal commissions and other investigative tribunals to serve subpoenas on persons interstate and to force such persons to give evidence at investigative tribunals. As I said, the Australian Democrats support this purpose which we see as being a useful step in the consolidation of a national legal system even if it is, as Senator Vanstone has said, to some extent piecemeal.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there is one major concern, and that is with clause 5 of the Bill which proposes to insert a new part 3a into the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. Division 4 of the proposed new part 3a deals with the execution of warrants issued by, or out of, a court or investigative tribunals. The proposed new section 19z sets out the procedure to be followed after a person has been apprehended pursuant to such a warrant. The section provides that, as soon as practicable after being apprehended, a person is to be brought before a magistrate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed new subsection (2) provides that a copy of a warrant, if it is available, must be produced to the magistrate. Proposed new subsection (3) provides that, if a copy of the warrant is not produced the magistrate may, under subsection (b):
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) adjourn the proceedings for such reasonable time, not exceeding seven days, as the magistrate specifies and remand the person on bail or in such custody as the magistrate specifies.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means that, for whatever reason, if the warrant for the apprehension of the person is not produced at the initial appearance, a person may be remanded on bail or in custody for up to seven days in order to allow the arresting officers time to produce the warrant. I believe this matter was dealt with by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which expressed considerable concern that a person, through no fault of his or her own, should be kept in custody possibly for up to seven days-and this is in the age when fax machines and other means of communication have been updated and are generally available to the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats believe this time period is excessive. I am told by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate)-and I would like him to address this point-that it would not be convenient to accede to the amendment which I am proposing, which aims to reduce the time from seven days to four days, because this Bill should be processed quickly through the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find it somewhat extraordinary that we should disregard what is essentially a very important civil liberties issue on the basis of the convenience of parliamentary procedures and a delay of only several days. I draw the comparison that the delay that the Minister is trying to avoid is equal to the time that a person might be kept in gaol pending the production of a warrant. I believe that the Minister should reconsider and that the Government should support the amendment that I will move on behalf of the Australian Democrats.

         —in reply-I thank those honourable senators who have indicated support for the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill. I understand that the Opposition would have liked to have a more comprehensive amendment or a substitution of the new Bill dealing with service and execution of process in this federation. The reason why the Government wanted to bring forward this matter relating to the relatively restricted area to do with tribunals is that initially Mr Justice Kennedy, the Chairman of the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, requested an urgent amendment to enable the interstate service of subpoenas requiring people to give evidence before investigative tribunals, such as royal commissions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As late as this morning I was informed by Mr D. F. Wicks, the principal solicitor assisting the Western Australian Royal Commission, that the Commission wishes to call several interstate witnesses, including major players, who have queried the Commission's capacity to require them to give evidence. The Commission has informed them that it does not have that power at present but that a Bill to confer that power is before the Commonwealth Parliament. Mr Wicks believes that if the Bill is not passed these persons will not give evidence. That is the basis for the concern that has been expressed by the Government, although it does not meet all the points that Senator Spindler has raised in relation to the particular matter which is the subject of his amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I need to emphasise that the seven-day period is an absolute limit. It is an absolute maximum. Under the Bill, where the warrant or a copy of it is not produced, the proceeding must be adjourned for a reasonable time, not exceeding seven days. What is a reasonable time will depend upon the circumstances of each case. In particular, it would depend upon what would be a reasonable time to send the warrant or a copy of it to the place at which the proceedings are being heard. In order to minimise the time that an apprehended person may possibly be remanded, proposed new sections 19e and 19z permit production of a facsimile copy of the warrant. In most cases this will both minimise the likelihood that a copy of the warrant will not be available when a person is taken before the magistrate and, where a copy is not available, be a strong factor in determining what is a reasonable period for the adjournment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The seven-day upper limit, which was recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report Service and Execution of Process, takes account of the possibility that a person may be apprehended in a remote location. I believe that that gives an indication that it would be an extremely rare event for the seven-day limit to be reached, because it is an upper limit within which we have a reasonable time requirement. Given the existence of facsimiles and so on, it is very unlikely that that seven-day upper limit will be reached.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given that fact, which I think we can fairly predict, and the urgency as perceived by the Western Australian Royal Commission, rather than accepting the amendment put forward by the Australian Democrats, which I agree has some merit, which would require sending the Bill back to the House of Representatives for passage some time next week-if we were fortunate, given the constraints of the Budget presentation and other matters that are pressing in that chamber-I think we would do better as a chamber to accept the present clause as drafted and understand the concerns of Senator Spindler but not accede to them on this occasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill deals with the most important matter of the interstate service and interstate enforcement of tribunal subpoenas. There are many such tribunals, royal commissions and standing commissions of inquiry operating throughout Australia. They will all be greatly aided by this provision, which will help to do what the Premiers Conference did-it did not actually deal with it specifically but did so in spirit-and simply act as Australians in the Federal system. After all, this is a chamber which reflects that Federal system. We are attempting to ensure that the legacy of colonial boundaries which divide jurisdictions in such an artificial way when it comes to the proper functioning of our courts, tribunals and royal commissions should not impede or frustrate proper evidence being required to be given to assist, in this case, royal commissions and tribunals of inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish the Bill, as drafted, a speedy passage. In relation to the larger matter moved by the Opposition, quite clearly, the Opposition amendments, in taking up the Law Reform Commission report, represent an attempt to implement a very major law reform initiative. I can assure Senator Vanstone that, with the extensive consultations with the States and Territories on the ALRC's report, the Government is well advanced. I hope that it will be possible by the end of this session to have a Bill presented to the Parliament dealing with the larger context of this matter of such concern in our federation. On the basis of the urgency of this Bill, I commend its speedy passage to the chamber.

         —It is perhaps appropriate to indicate why the coalition will not be supporting this amendment. The Australian Democrats are in a peculiar position of being able to know in advance what both parties are going to move as amendments to pieces of legislation by looking at the House of Representatives Hansard. Of course, neither the Government nor the Opposition is in a position to have any advance notice of what the Democrats intend to move by way of amendment. I do not say on my Party's behalf that four days is an unsuitable time as opposed to seven. I have not sought consultation on that. The reason for that is that, while this piece of paper has wafted in front of me, I do not know whether consultation has been had with the Government. It has certainly not been had, as I understand it, with the Opposition. It is simply not the appropriate way to make a change, albeit one that may be a good one.

This is the situation this morning. It is for that reason that the coalition will not be supporting this amendment at this time.

The reason for the amendment being submitted at such a late stage without prior consultation is that we are still awaiting a report from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has put out a report raising this particular concern and has written to the Minister.

Do I take it from Senator Spindler's remarks that the Australian Democrats in future will decide their voting practices in relation to matters that have been before the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in accordance with what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee says? He appears to be saying that the matter has been raised, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has not yet issued a report with a response from the Minister, therefore, this matter should be put forward.

        I am gratified that the Democrats take so much notice of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I just wish that on every other occasion they did the same-they do not appear to be agreeing to do that on all other occasions. I do not think that is an adequate explanation at all. In fact, if the matter is being raised because the Scrutiny of Bills Committee first raised this matter, why was the amendment not floated at that time, pending withdrawal if the Scrutiny of Bills Committee decided it was acceptable?

However, the risk is that those of us who have not had time to consult with our parties cannot support the amendments. My remarks are not meant as any attack, but as an explanation as to why the Democrats cannot ask other parties to support them without having flagged the amendment which, by Senator Spindler's own mouth, he was aware of as soon as the first report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee came out.

         —Senator Vanstone spoke of indulgences a moment ago and as a member of the one true et cetera, et cetera I can give a plenary indulgence on this occasion. It is a fact that the Australian Democrats and the Government have been made aware of the Opposition's amendments as they were moved in the House of Representatives by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). I believe that they embody that comprehensive set of amendments that would flow from a simple acceptance of the report of the Law Reform Commission. Therefore, for the reasons that I outlined in my response in the second reading debate, the Government is not prepared to have its role in relation to this matter taken over by the Opposition. As I indicated before, we hope to have a comprehensive set of amendments on this matter available for the Parliament later this session.

        I table the Government amendments to the Bill and a supplementary explanatory memorandum. At the outset of this particular issue the Government made its objective very clear; that is, to tackle the corruptive influence of the corporate dollar on the electoral process. We recognise that that influence was present at three levels: the potential of stark and direct corruption; the question of undue influence and its impact on the process; and the aspect of the corporate dollar dictating the political agenda. We found that as being totally contrary to the basic principle in our society of one person one vote, one vote one value. If a person's vote or a person's say in society is dependent on the level of his bank account, then that basic democratic principle is distorted.
       </para>
       <para>
        We set out to do this in two ways: firstly, to contain costs; and, secondly, to ensure full disclosure and spot auditing not only of political parties but also of relevant third party organisations. We made it very clear that there was a need to do both these things at the same time. To do otherwise would do nothing but increase the reliance on the brown paper bag way of funding political parties. So we need to tackle this particular issue at source.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our recognition of the need to do both things was reinforced by the experience in the United States where there is full disclosure legislation, but from vice presidents down people have been stung by their reliance on the brown paper bag approach to raising political funds-from Spiro Agnew to a dozen legislators in Arizona just a few months ago. We were also reinforced by the acknowledgment in our country of no-one less than Mr John Howard who said that disclosure in itself is not enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        I acknowledge that he went on to indicate alternatives to what we were proposing. But disclosure is not enough and it has been seen not to be enough in the national context. The Government recognised very fully that it had to tackle this issue at source. Over the last eight or nine years the Government has continually tried to tackle this issue with disclosure legislation, with public funding and with other measures to contain costs. But, sadly, for our process they have not worked.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the reasons why the approach in this country has not been comprehensive enough is that continually over that period we have met with blind, brick wall opposition from the official Opposition at both State and Federal level. There is no doubt that it has a vested interest in ensuring that the influence of the corporate dollar is maintained in our process. It has opposed in parliaments, parliamentary committees and in the public any measure to address the problem fully.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in the meantime, in our society on a State level, for instance, there has been a plethora of inquiries. Overseas we have seen the same sort of experience-all relating to that single issue of the reliance of political parties and the process on corporate dollars. We really have to tackle this issue now as a country, as a Parliament and particularly as a Senate. A measure now would be preventative. If we do not take preventative measures now, then at the end of this decade people will come into this place with remedial measures, and that will not be good enough for our process.
       </para>
       <para>
        The core of the problem is that Australia spends more on Federal election campaigns than is spent per capita on a presidential campaign in the United States. It is not only the judgment of the Government that propelled us towards taking and introducing these measures. Internationally, western democracies have targeted this issue-the costs of campaigning, the reliance of parties on the corporate dollar-in the way that we as a Government have initiated by this particular legislation. They have targeted the costs of electronic broadcasting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Approximately three countries in the world allow totally uncontrolled access to radio and television advertisements as we do in Australia. Internationally, they have had to contend with this argument of freedom of speech. A group such as  Article 19, which has somehow been propelled into this debate in recent days-one wonders who is actually at work there and for what reason-ought to look at the situation in the United Kingdom where there is a ban on political advertisements for 365 days a year-366 days in a leap year. What this Government is trying to do is not novel. It is a total hypocrisy for organisations such as Article 19, which can see the international experience in this area, to somehow be awoken to the Australian political process.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has also been recognised nationally that there is a need to come to grips with this issue. Two years ago the Joint Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings produced a report entitled, Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune. The Committee comprised members of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats. That Committee targeted both legs of the issue- disclosure and the costs of campaigning. In a report it recommended that we do something about both. It recommended free time, and that is where the Government drifts away from its recommendations. But it acknowledged the very essential need to do something about the costs of campaigning, as well as disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        On a State level we have had inquiry after inquiry in recent years. I need only quote one passage of the report by Commissioner Roden of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. It is a telling quotation:
       </para>
       <para>
        With the mounting costs of campaign advertisements parties must be increasingly vulnerable to attempts by substantial donors to exert influence.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is precisely why the Government is taking these measures at present. We focused, as did the Joint Committee and as have overseas countries, on radio and television broadcast costs. It is not freedom of speech. It is interesting that in recent days Dr Hewson has converted to this issue. In Dr Hewson's case-it was not all that long ago-he was saying very loudly that he has a disposition against advertisements in this area, and I will come to his quotation later.
       </para>
       <para>
        Countries have recognised that the cost of radio and television broadcasting advertisements is very much the black hole of campaign expenditure. In the last three election campaigns radio and television expenditure increased from $6m to $15m. Radio has led the way in the increase in rates for advertisements.

         —In its rate of increase. It is not only the past and recent experience we have to look at. When one looks at the international experience, one discovers very clearly that the rate of expected increase in expenditure in this area will be huge compared with what we had even in recent years. We have put up this proposal and we have met with a somewhat arrogant and superior approach from quite a number of sources, in particular my friends in the press gallery. Their response has been, `There must be another way'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have put the Opposition aside because it has had no interest at all-and its record shows that-in ensuring that this process is kept clean. However, let us look for a moment at some of the commentators. They have said, `There must be another way'. A couple of years ago the Joint Committee put up free time, which was met with an enormous reaction. The approach was that there must be another way. When the shorter ban was put up about five days ago by me, once again there was an enormous reaction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Basically, whether it is disclosure or free time, we have to contend comprehensively with this issue. By the Government's action today, the challenge will be met. However, it is no longer good enough to say, `There must be another way' and not come up with another way. I think this challenge goes very squarely towards the Australian Democrats.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been prepared to negotiate, but not with that mob over there. Our General Secretary, Bob Hogg, went to the Opposition's organisation to discuss this matter, but he walked into a brick wall. It is the same sort of brick wall that we have confronted over the last decade from the Opposition on any issue such as this. So we went to the Democrats.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said a couple of months ago in this Parliament, I can count on and I look forward to the Australian Democrats coming forward with a workable proposition. They have been consistent over the years-and this is their challenge now- in recognising the need to contain election campaigning costs. On the Standing Committee I mentioned earlier, the former Senator Jenkins held a view-it was not adopted by the rest of the Committee-which was for a full time ban. Michael Macklin, the former Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, also held a very similar view. The former Leader of the Australian Democrats, Janine Haines, is consistently on the record as holding very firm views about the need to contain, regulate and probably ban electoral advertising, but that was before recent events.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is good to see that both major contenders to the throne of the Democrats are here. From my discussions with Democrats in this place, I think there has been a recognition by all of them. Senator Coulter and the rest of the Democrats come into this place as great Green candidates. But the real issue confronting them now is whether they leave this process as the Green party or as the greenback dollar party. What are the Democrats trying to protect if they do not do something about containing electoral costs?
       </para>
       <para>
        One wonders why the Democrats have not come up with the goods in the last few months. Of course, there is leadership paralysis and there is no cohesive approach. They would acknowledge that. No comprehensive model has been put up by them. But I would hate to think that it was because of the influence of, say, Mr Goldsworthy in his correspondence to Heather Southcott in South Australia imploring the Democrats not to support the Government; and I would hate to think that it was the Liberals' intellectually and politically dishonest campaign in recent weeks-a campaign that did not ignite public opinion and public support but which seems to have ignited those closet Liberals and Democrats in Queensland. I would hate even more to suggest or even think that it has been because of the foresters' campaign. For example, yesterday we saw the great headline, `Democrats urged to reject ban'. The article reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        The forest industry has urged the Australian Democrats to reject the Federal Government's proposed limited ban on political advertising on radio and television-
       </para>
       <para>
        because-
       </para>
       <para>
        it was opposed to any ban that could affect its ability to promote the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        They should go back to their Green mates if they cannot grapple with this issue fully and properly. The Democrats have got to ask themselves what sort of interests they are protecting and what they will be subjecting the Australian political process to if they do not come across on this particular issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is now our turn to keep the Australian Democrats honest and that is why we are taking the approach of sending the whole Bill to the parliamentary committee. Our approach maintains the pressure and keeps both aspects alive. But in particular let me say one thing with respect to keeping the Liberals honest. In recent days I have been concerned about disclosure-and I know that Senator Powell has as well. The real motive behind the Liberals wanting to defer this matter to a never-ending committee-as does the Olsen proposal-is that they want time. They want time because the reports are wide and they are running. In fact, Senator Olsen, in the business community the cat is out of the bag. The Liberals are in the process of setting up a nationally, if not internationally, based slush fund-a trust account-to pre-empt, to beat this disclosure provision.

        What we have had in recent days originating from the Liberal headquarters here is the state-of-the-art version of the brown paper bag. The electronic brown paper bag is being pursued through the setting up of a trust account before this legislation is put in place. From the start, our objective has been to have measures to contain costs and to ensure that political parties are subject to public scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        This need has been recognised by commission after commission. It has been highlighted by the recent action of the Liberal Party in this country-a dishonest approach to disclosure which lets the cat out of the bag in terms of their need to have this inquiry run forever. We have already had one inquiry; the issues have been canvassed. The Committee will now have to focus on the Bill and two months or so is long enough. As I say, our approach to contend and grapple with both issues is highlighted by what I have just said-we need to do both.
       </para>
       <para>
        The experience internationally is that one cannot act effectively until one does both. As I say, that has been acknowledged even by a former leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Howard. I say to Senator Powell and Senator Coulter-I will not talk to the Opposition: this is Australia's last chance to keep the political agenda free from the corruptive influence of the corporate dollar. If they are true to their interests and stated desires, I am sure that they will cooperate fully on this committee.

         —At the moment, the Kirki and a tanker into which the remaining oil from the Kirki will be transferred are off the Western Australian coast, about 30 nautical miles north of Dampier. The vessels are currently being berthed alongside each other. The authorities expect the transfer of the oil to commence this afternoon. The operation will take some four to five days.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The salvors have done a superlative job in averting a catastrophe. I take the opportunity to say that there is no question, particularly if anyone has actually seen the footage of the incident, that it was the quite extraordinary courage and skill of the crew of the Lady Kathleen that did substantially avert a major disaster in the ship coming ashore and breaking up. It has been their continuing professionalism in improving the buoyancy of the vessel and adjusting the trim over the last week or so that is now making the transfer of the oil possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has based oil pollution equipment at Karratha, aircraft are on stand-by during the operation should any difficulties occur, and of course the authorities will not hesitate to take action if it appears that the transfer cannot be completed safely.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is a signatory to a number of international conventions dealing with both ship safety and pollution, the Geneva convention on the high seas being just one of them. This incident, of course, did occur on the high seas, outside Australia's legal jurisdiction, but it has given rise to a number of concerns that are currently being pursued.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prior to the Kirki incident-from memory, it was about a week before-I wrote to all of my State and Territory colleagues asking for a major review to be undertaken of the national plan to combat oil pollution. I will be pursuing that request through the forum of ATAC, and I understand that in fact the next meeting of those Ministers will take place later this year in Darwin. AMSA is also investigating the possibility, which will have to be done by consultation and agreement, of having a two-stage inspection of ships that visit Australian ports. I might point out that Australia is one of only a handful of countries that carry out port inspections of ships and, of course, the safety record of our fleet is exemplary. We will also be examining whatever methods can be brought to bear to support the moves that are currently being made by the International Maritime Organisation to increase the surveillance and scrutiny of the certification of these vessels.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, a very heavy responsibility, in my view, rests with the oil companies which actually own the cargoes that are carried in these ships. Since the Kirki incident I have written not just to BP but to all oil companies in Australia that use tankers, reminding them of their obligations in this regard and asking them to consider whether their policies in relation to the carriage of oil and tankers need to be reviewed. I await their response.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia, being largely self-sufficient in oil, is not pre-eminent in both the use of tankers or indeed the construction of tankers, but we are doing everything possible in the international forums that are available to us to increase the surveillance and certification of these ships.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the marine investigation into the Kirki is complete, I have no doubt, from the information that has already been made available to me, that it will yield valuable information in terms of assisting Australia to make sure that an incident such as the Kirki incident does not occur again.

         —My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer the Minister to the July labour force figures showing that the unemployment rate for young Australians aged from 15 to 19 years looking for full time work rose to a 60-year record of 28.5 per cent seasonally adjusted, which is three times the adult rate, as more than 121,000 teenage full time jobs disappeared over the last 12 months, chopping the number of 15- to 19-year-olds in full time work in Australia from 415,000 in July last year to only 294,000. As the Government is now paying more than $350m a year to keep 170,000 year 11 and year 12 students at school, instead of them flooding into dole queues, what levels of youth unemployment does the Government expect when this dammed-up volume of school leavers spills over into the labour market next December, January and February? How long will young Australians have to put up with these record unemployment levels from the recession Mr Keating said `we had to have'?

         —It is not quite correct to say, as has been widely reported, that a quarter of all those aged 15 to 19 are unemployed. It is true that 28.5 per cent of those in the full time labour force are unemployed, but they represent only just under 9 per cent of all those aged 15 to 19. A very large proportion of those aged 15 to 19 are engaged in full time education.

        The question of the school retention rate raised by Senator Baume is a matter about which I believe the Government can feel genuinely proud, having achieved in 1990 a school retention rate of 64 per cent compared with 36 per cent when we came to office. That means that those entering the work force after that longer time in school are better educated, better trained and better equipped to find jobs in what is obviously a very difficult labour market.

        We do recognise that here, as is typically the case in an economic downturn, the young people have been those hardest hit. What we have done about dealing with that is to establish active labour market programs which, together with a number of new initiatives announced in the March economic statement, ensure that education, training and employment opportunities are available for young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a time of unemployment and recession, such as we are going through at the moment, it is particularly crucial that we maintain opportunities for young men and women to develop skills through apprenticeships and traineeships. We are providing about $16m extra over two years for measures to keep apprentices and trainees in employment or to help them continue training while they are unemployed. We have also allocated, it should be recalled, almost $60m over two years for extra pre-vocational training places at TAFE colleges to help young people prepare for work.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the March economic statement, we also announced enhancements to other labour market and training programs available to young unemployed people, such as Jobtrain, Jobstart and Skillshare. Obviously, this is going to continue to be a problem and will be exacerbated when young people spill onto the employment market at the end of the school year. Our hope, and our expectation, is that we have in place policies which will now ensure a sustainable growth in activity and, with the usual lags, sustainable growth in jobs.

        Again I remind those who say, as Senator Alston did by way of interjection, `At what price?', that after the last recession we had in this country, back in the early 1980s, when the unemployment rate was higher than it is now-10.3 per cent-we had an inflation rate of 11.2 per cent, as compared with the inflation rate we now have of 3.4 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no necessary magical connection between recessions and lowering of the inflation rate. The only way we get a lowering of the inflation rate is by a deliberately and carefully tailored policy of the kind that we have been putting in place over a period of time. Recession may have made a contribution to that, but it is not the sole explanation for it. The reality of its existence-sustainably low inflation, markedly less than the OECD average of 6.2 per cent and markedly less than the average of our major trading partners at 4.3 per cent-has created the conditions for an economic recovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Opposition further that these conditions have been achieved in an environment where the participation rate, so far as employment is concerned, was very much lower back in the early 1980s than is the case now. From no point of view is it possible to argue that there is any necessary connection between the recession and inflation. It has been a very different state of affairs this time around as compared with the last time, for the reasons that are self-evident when one looks at the figures.

In the March industry statement my colleague Senator John Button announced plans to set up a panel of systems integration companies to service major public sector information technology projects. `Systems integration' is a somewhat nebulous term to those outside the computer industry. Basically, it refers to the service of integrating the various components of a modern computer system. That might involve sourcing hardware and off-the-shelf software, developing customised software and getting systems up and running. It is a complex task, but one in which Australian companies have shown considerable skills in the past.

       <para>
        The panel will apply to all IT contracts over $1m involving systems integration, unless grounds for exemption are established. When the request for information process closed on 31 July, over 180 companies had asked for details of the panel and 80 had responded. The respondents include software, hardware and services suppliers, consultants, personnel agencies, and even universities and computer magazines. This level of interest clearly shows that the Government's policy is right for the times. I am pleased that all the major Australian companies involved in systems integration have responded to the request.
       </para>
       <para>
        The requests for information are being analysed and will assist in providing the basis for tender specifications. The Government will issue a draft request for tender later this month, soliciting public comment on the terms of the tender by 25 September. The final request for tender will be issued in October and close on 16 October. The size and structure of the systems integration panel as well as the companies chosen for the panel will be announced by the end of the year. The panel will be reviewed every 12 to 18 months to monitor its effectiveness, to monitor the performance of companies on the panel, and perhaps to change its membership from time to time as circumstances require.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have received his report in respect of all of those notorious bankrupts. I do not intend to name them for the reason I will give in a moment. It can be expected that the administration of those particular estates will be particularly lengthy. He has found, from the point of view of bankruptcy administration generally, that the administrations are proceeding satisfactorily and that creditors' interests are being protected. In the case of one particular bankrupt, of course, one hopes that the new trustees recently appointed will be able to progress the administration. I have asked the Inspector-General to continue to monitor the progress of those administrations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is important, when one is reacting to that real concern and anger out in the community at the spectacle of certain high living bankrupts appearing to live very well at a time when many Australian households are battling and their creditors are in straitened circumstances, that one does not smear or stigmatise the whole range of bankrupts who have found that conditions are such that they have had to enter into that particular arrangement provided for by our laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, the fact is that the Government has responded very firmly to the spectacle which, as I say, has angered many Australians. It has indicated, for example, in relation to travel overseas by bankrupts, that trustees will not be able to give permission for a bankrupt to travel abroad unless all the creditors have been paid in full every brass razoo that they are owed. The court may, on an application, be able to give permission for a bankrupt to travel overseas if there are compassionate grounds, for example, or if an undertaking is given in relation to employment overseas which will see creditors paid, with cast-iron guarantees as to the flow of income being available in part for the creditors. That is the second major reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia we have extremely stringent and effective laws dealing with identifying and tracing assets that a bankrupt may, in anticipation, have transferred to a member of the family or to some other arrangement like a company, a trust or a partnership to disguise the fact that there are assets available to creditors. Whilst we have very good laws to trace those assets and make them available for creditors, we have had a very cumbersome process relating to the income which might be earned by a bankrupt. It is the Government's intention to move away from the cumbersome court process to an administrative process to enable an arrangement to be made whereby a certain level of income can remain in the hands of a bankrupt-certainly above the social security benefit, to encourage the bankrupt to enter the work force-but that a portion of the earnings ought to be available to creditors over the period of the bankruptcy. I hope to be introducing this legislation later this session. I look forward to the support of the chamber for its speedy passage.

Although I do not intend to comment in any detail on the incident-because the investigation is proceeding apace; the investigating unit will have the flight data recorders from the aircraft available tomorrow; and I expect that this is going to be very speedily dealt with-it needs to be said at this point in time that this incident that occurred at Sydney Airport yesterday, and it was a serious one, is not in any way related to the presence or absence of the third runway, or the fourth, fifth or sixth.

         —It does the serious examination of these very serious incidents no justice to simply hang these tags on them. The facts are that simultaneous operations are in operation at many, many major airports around the world. There is absolutely no reason whatever why simultaneous operations, if conducted efficiently and professionally, cannot be used-as they are used in Adelaide, as well as Sydney-with perfect safety.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The incident that occurred yesterday at Sydney Airport resulted from two aircraft, under simultaneous operations, landing at the airport. The Thai Airways aircraft which landed on the north-south runway was told quite clearly by the air traffic controller concerned-I have read the voice tapes from the control tower at the airport-to pull up short of the intersecting runway. This was acknowledged by the pilot.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also point out that from the point of touch-down to the point of that intersect there is 8,000 feet of runway-significantly more than a DC10, fully loaded and operating normally, needs to land safely. The incident is being investigated currently. I will provide the Senate with a full report of that investigation when it is completed and is available to me.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as the third runway is concerned-and I know there are no essential differences at all between Senator Brownhill and me on this issue-the EIS process is proceeding. The supplement is in the process of being prepared. Under the Act, it has to address some 14,000 matters that were raised in the thousands of submissions received in that EIS process. Currently, about half the chapters of the supplement have been completed and circulated to the necessary agencies. It is expected that the remaining chapters will be delivered in the next two to three weeks. As a result of that, it is expected that Cabinet will consider that final result later this year.

       <para>
        On 20 June I launched a $25m program to raise the efficiency of Australian workplaces through the Australian best practice reform program. That program asks Australian industry to identify where in the world industrial practices are performed best, their characteristics and how much of those principles can be imported into Australian workplaces to change the workplace culture in this country to a more productive one, and to recognise the need to follow the cooperative approach of the Hawke Government to industrial relations and not the old Fraser Government conflict model of industrial relations.

        In addition, on 19 July at a major conference attended by over 250 leaders of business, trade unions, government and academia, Mr John Prescott, the Managing Director of BHP, and I released the guidelines for this program. The theme of that conference-`Lifting Australia's game'-was one in which we concentrated, as Australian unions and employers, on identifying what happens in workplaces that have a productive culture, and on that basis we launched the program properly for Australia. We now have over 220 applications from companies of varying sizes and types of industry, such as the metal industry, the meat industry, the building industry, the clothing and textile industry, the food industry, the tourism and hospitality industry and the vehicle industry. That is, a whole range of companies across-the-board have exhibited interest in wanting to be part of this program and have put their workplaces on the line as laboratories for experiments in turning them into vastly more productive workplaces. The bids for funds through the program will close at the end of September and I will then be in a position to announce the opening round of successful companies.

         —I will respond to that interjection because it is very interesting that some stimulus and catalyst is necessary to encourage Australian industry to move more quickly down this course. One would have thought it would have moved more rapidly when one looks at examples such as Australia Post, the ICI Australia Ltd plant at Botany and the BHP plant at Newcastle, where a more human approach to industrial relations has been taken and where workers are regarded not as simply extensions of machines but as important elements in the productive culture of those companies, and that one can achieve higher levels of production, higher wages and a greater degree of job satisfaction as well. One would have thought those examples would have stood out, but unfortunately Australian industry has been slow to try to emulate such practices and it is necessary to encourage that in a limited sort of way. That is what this program does; I think it will lead the way in helping Australia establish a new and more productive workplace culture and it will encourage a more human dimension in industrial relations. It is a significant program and I am pleased to announce that so many Australian companies are now interested in participating in it.

The Australian Securities Commission investigation may well solve that problem. I do not believe-the decision to begin the examination having been taken-that a timetable has yet been laid out.

        Cabinet has decided, `subject to the support of Caucus'-that is actually written in in pencil in brackets-that a House of Representatives select committee be established to inquire into press ownership. Its duties will be to inquire into structural practice of the print media; industry inhibiting competition between publications, including ownership; protection, including paper and supply; and distribution arrangements. It will review the print media's distribution information gathering arrangements and it will review the adequacy of current Commonwealth legislation and practice to foster competition and diversity of ownership in the print media.

Is he aware of the report in the August 1991 issue of Choice magazine which refers to evidence that some unscrupulous producers are labelling produce as organic and charging a premium price for it when in fact that produce has been grown conventionally, including the use of pesticides and fungicides? Does the Minister agree that consumers who are concerned to avoid these substances in their food should be able to have confidence that a product that is labelled organic has been organically grown? Can the Minister advise the Senate on what action the Government has taken, or intends to take, to protect consumers from this unscrupulous practice?

         —Senator Devereux did draw my attention to this article in Choice, and I know that he has taken an interest in it quite independently of Choice magazine's review of the fact that organic produce is on sale at various markets and other places. Of course, it is very difficult to determine whether produce deserves that particular description. Organic produce is generally regarded as produce grown without the use of pesticides or chemical fertilisers, although different grades are apparently recognised.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have to tell Senator Devereux that currently there are no specific legal requirements which organic produce is required to meet under the food standards code. An organic produce advisory committee established by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is developing standards for the production of organic food, primarily for export purposes. I see that Senator Panizza is well aware of this. I was not, but no doubt Senator Panizza keeps on eye on these matters in relation to the very important foreign earnings that can be gained from the export of Australian produce. However, Federal and State consumer protection legislation which prohibits false or misleading representations about goods could apply. I would hope that State and Territory consumer affairs bureaus rigorously pursue any alleged breach of these provisions as all Australian consumers, as Senator Bolkus says, have every right to receive what they pay for in the way in which it is described.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has recently created the National Food Authority, which will commence operations on 19 August 1991. The National Food Authority will be responsible for developing food standards to be adopted by the States and Territories and will be taking particular interest in food labelling issues. I know that there is a lot of interest in the community about organic food and accuracy in labelling, and I would expect the National Food Authority to take a strong lead in responding to these concerns. The new Authority may wish to look at the Department of Primary Industries and Energy standards for export trade as a basis for domestic regulation of the use of the term `organic', and I will be encouraging it to do so.

         —I had not anticipated that Senator Newman would be raising this question. As the Senate knows, the Trades and Labour Council of the ACT has established a picket line at each access road to Parliament House in support of catering staff. It is industrial action, and action that unions involved with the ACT Trades and Labour Council are adhering to. Comcar drivers, as a consequence of that, have been directed by the Transport Workers Union not to cross the picket line. However, as we found this morning, passengers are being dropped at the closest point to their destination without the vehicle crossing the picket line. I must admit, from my end, that I appreciated the short walk up to the entrance, although my colleague Senator Ray seems to have suffered because of it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Comcar management has not issued any contrary direction to drivers. The parliamentary transport officers, I must say, did receive complaints from a number of members who obviously share Senator Newman's reaction to this industrial action. Complaints have come from Senator Newman herself, Ian McLachlan, Peter Reith and Peter Nugent. The three members each complained of having to walk some distance from the picket line to Parliament House.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is fair to say that in Senator Newman's case it is probably indicative of the sort of industrial relations negotiation process that we will have if the Liberals ever take over power in this country. The confrontationist position that was taken by those members this morning is in no way helpful to the resolution of the dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am informed that Senator Newman insisted that the Comcar driver should cross the picket line. When police officers arrived at the scene, in a spirit of negotiation, of course, she asserted that the driver had no excuse not to proceed because he had a police escort. The driver, in conformity with the industrial action of his union and the ACT Labour Council, still refused to cross the picket line and Senator Newman was subsequently transported to the Senate entrance by the parliamentary transport officer.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, that is indicative of the sort of industrial relations practices that we should expect and have, in fact, seen from the Opposition. Negotiation to settle the dispute is not part of the Opposition's agenda. It is not part of its agenda to the extent that one or more of the abovementioned members or senators is alleged to have threatened those drivers that they would lose their jobs if they did not cross the picket line. That is not the sort of industrial negotiation process that we are on about. I must take this opportunity to warn the Australian people that that sort of confrontationist approach to industrial relations is in no way conducive to the sort of economic direction that this country needs to take.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will get a copy of the terms of the agreement between my Department, Comcar and the parliamentary officers. But I can tell Senator Newman that I am sure that any agreement between the parties would take into account legitimate industrial action.

        When we left here in June we were told that the recovery was just around the corner; that the light on the hill had moved to the end of the tunnel; and that it would not be very long before Australia was back on track and the economy would be coming out of the current recession. As we all know, that was just another political lie. Mr Kelty said the other day that reality has to be measured by performance. I think that is a pretty fair test because surely the only way to judge a political party is over time and on its record.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a government that has been in office for more than eight years. We are entitled to examine just what a performance it has put up in that time. Apart from just looking at the statistics and measuring the enormity of its economic failures, it might be best to look at what this Government regarded as its priorities when it came to office. If any outfit has claimed a mortgage on social justice it is the Australian Labor Party. We are constantly berated by the fact that we are lacking in compassion, not concerned about addressing Australia's economic problems and not concerned about the impact on individuals. On the current figures of unemployment we have a disaster of massive proportions. Even the stark statistics hide the level of human misery.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure that Senator Richardson will get up and blather on about how the Government is very concerned and how it hopes that it will be able to deliver in due course. I think the words that ought to haunt Senator Richardson and, indeed, haunt the Labor Party were those uttered by him in May 1983 and again in October 1983. This is the architect of the Keating ascendancy. This is the man who is going to be the chief adviser on all things important to a new Labor Government. This is the man who is presumably going to tell us what social justice is all about, what its real agenda ought to be, what its priorities have always been, and how they ought to remain the same. Let us just look at what Senator Richardson said in May 1983:
       </para>
       <para>
        The last election was won by the Australian Labor Party on the issue of unemployment. This Government will sink or swim on its performance in providing jobs. It is worth examining why the Fraser Government's record in unemployment finally proved its undoing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson is nailing his colours to the wall, setting up the Government's own high jump bar, deciding what its priorities ought to be and spelling out as clearly as possible the standard by which it ought to be judged. That was not a trite off the cuff comment in the glow of victory after eight years in the wilderness because again, in October of that year, Senator Richardson stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I might say that the Labor Government was elected primarily on the issue of unemployment. It recognises its responsibilities in this area and if it fails over the years to meet the problem of unemployment it will not be elected again, and it will not deserve to be.
       </para>
       <para>
        One could not get truer words than those. If ever a government stands condemned out of its own mouth, this Government does. I do not think there is anyone in Australia who is not aware of the enormity of the problems that have been caused by unemployment. The figures themselves quite often tell only half the story. The current unemployment rate is marginally below 10 per cent, although every State, except New South Wales, has unemployment figures over that magical number. If we add to the 9.8 per cent rate the ABS underemployment rate-in other words, those with jobs but who would prefer to work more hours; this was the question that the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, was not only abysmally unable to answer but was also apparently so terrified that he lost control of the whole debate and tried to make some stupid distinction between ABS figures and DSS figures--

         —I see. That is the narrow way the Minister defines it. He is not interested in the number of people said to be unemployed by the Government but is interested only in the number of people paid benefits. If that is the level of his interest in the subject, it is pretty narrow stuff. If we add the ABS underemployment rate of 6.2 per cent and the proportion of the work force who have left in the last 12 months-they have given up the ghost or thrown in the towel-we find that the labour force, consisting of either discouraged workers, underemployed or simply unemployed, is about 16.7 per cent or over 1.4 million workers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That was really the sort of figure that Senator Walters was inviting the Minister to proffer. Of course, he is not only acutely aware of it, but also acutely sensitive to it, because that in itself destroys any claim that this Government could have to understand social justice, let alone deliver it to the Australian population.
       </para>
       <para>
        The numbers on the dole are now in excess of 700,000. Employment in the month of July fell by 83,000, the biggest monthly fall since the ABS labour force survey-in which the Minister is not interested-began in 1978. Had the participation rate not fallen in July, the unemployment rate would have been 10.3 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have all these basket cases around Australia, with the shining exception of New South Wales, which are just managing to keep the level under the 10 per cent figure officially, but in reality, of course, those out there at the coalface know precisely what is happening: they know that they cannot get jobs, they cannot get the jobs of their choice and, to the extent that they do have jobs, they are very worried indeed about their job security.
       </para>
       <para>
        Probably about the worst fate that could be inflicted on anyone in a democratic society is to have a government which in the one breath says-as the Prime Minister said in March of last year-that `there is no need to fear a recession in any sense', and then in the same month to have the Treasurer saying, `A slower year of growth, but there will not be a recession ahead. We will not let there be a recession'. Then, of course, eight months later, he was saying, `This was the recession Australia had to have' and `I knew there had to be one but I did not want to tell you'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the level of morality that drives this Government: someone who pretends to the highest office in the land is quite unrepentant about those sorts of misstatements and misleading comments but, of course, is quite oblivious to his own inept performance, even to the point where yesterday he was actually boasting about his own achievements in office. It seems an extraordinary proposition that he can be so unaware of the level of foreign debt, which is of the order of $160 billion compared to about $35 billion when the Government came to office. We have a current account deficit of about $16.5 billion-all sorts of catastrophic figures-and a Budget outcome that is something like $13 billion worse than it was predicted to be two years ago. The last Budget surplus was predicted to be $8.1 billion. The outcome was $1.9 billion. These are the credentials of someone who claims to be able to lead the country and, presumably, is proud of what he has achieved to date.
       </para>
       <para>
        If that is the sort of commitment to delivering prosperity and the concomitant social improvements, then we are all entitled to be scared stiff. I will be very interested in the campaign manager's contribution to this debate because, unless he has some very good advice that he has been withholding from Mr Keating, it is quite clear that there is not going to be any significant improvement in the figures or, indeed, even in the rhetoric. I would have thought that was the very least that we could have expected to date.
       </para>
       <para>
        All the evidence indicates that the employment regime in this country is going to remain very depressed for months and perhaps years ahead. As Mr Will Bailey said the other day, unemployment could stay above 10 per cent for at least 18 months. Treasury says that it will exceed 10 per cent through 1991-92. So, of course, does the parrot, Mr Kerin. The putative Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, agrees with that proposition. Of course, Mr Dawkins, in releasing a report the other day about employment prospects through to the year 2000, had to concede that the people most at risk from Labor's current economic policies are the young, the unskilled, Aboriginals and migrants; in other words, the very sort of people that social justice is supposed to be all about-the disadvantaged, the marginalised, the economically vulnerable, the ones who are bearing the brunt of this recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        Long term unemployed are a relatively recent phenomenon. When unemployment benefits were introduced they were meant to be a transition payment of about six months duration. Now, of course, there are something like 180,000 long term unemployed, a higher figure by far than in 1983, despite Mr Dawkins's protestations to the contrary. Indeed, what Mr Dawkins had to say on AM the other day was:
       </para>
       <para>
        All of our effort these days is placed into trying to get the longer term unemployed back into the labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is being spectacularly unsuccessful, to use an Evansism, and, indeed, the Auditor-General has made it clear in his recent criticisms that some of the major labour market programs have been particularly unsuccessful in achieving that aim. In fact, Jobtrain, which is supposed to be targeted at the long term unemployed, has seen a program of something like $121m; and more than half the recipients of that program have been unemployed for less than six months. So it is very poorly targeted. We can understand the reasons why, but it simply demonstrates that this Government is not able to offer any hope to those people who are not only the victims of this recession but who, to all intents and purposes, are still languishing from the last one, back in the early 1980s.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have probably the worst employment record of any government in this country over such a period of time. It has been in office now for 8 1/4 years. There is no way in which one could say that it is premature to judge it on its record. One could not ask for more than four terms in office to deliver the goods. Indeed, all we have got to show for it at the end of that very long period are record levels of unemployment-and not just in a global sense. The unemployment rate for males is now higher than when Labor came to office, at 10.1 per cent. The full time unemployment rate for teenagers is now 28.5 per cent-a 1.8 percentage increase over 1983. The male participation rate has fallen by 2.9 percentage points. The full time participation rate for males has fallen by a massive 4.9 percentage points. The unemployment rate is now higher in Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania than in April 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are all sorts of reasons why these figures disguise the enormity of the problem. We constantly hear this empty boast about 1.6 million new jobs. I am sure that that number has been scaled down a bit, but even so, when one analyses who these people are, one finds that they are largely second income earners. They are married women getting into the work force. They are part time, overwhelmingly, rather than full time. They are simply not the breadwinners, not the people that one would have thought were entitled to expect 1.6 million jobs to boost family incomes and to raise the standard of living generally. We know to what extent that has fallen: something of the order of $60 per week in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The people who have really gained from the supposed growth in employment are not the ones about which Labor has always professed to be mostly concerned-the breadwinners. The number, of course, has been even more inflated by the fact that we have had very high school retention rates. That is a very good thing in itself. It hopefully suggests that there will be a higher level of quality output and that we will have better educated students coming into the labour market. They have not got much to look forward to. One can well understand why they would be terrified about leaving school prematurely. In many respects, that is a good thing: they ought to stay there as long as possible and have themselves as well qualified as possible. But it is not much consolation when one tries to analyse why the figures are as they are. If those people were treated on the same basis as they were in the early 1980s, then of course the unemployment figures would be even higher than the 16.7 per cent figure that I have cited.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we really have is a social problem of tragic proportions, playing with people's lives and futures in many respects. The Government has clearly got to accept the responsibility for this despairing outcome because of its failure to bite the bullet and because it knows in its heart of hearts what ought to be done, yet lacks the intestinal fortitude to deliver.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson is not really very strong on policy but I think even he knows what micro-economic reform is all about. He knows that the rest of the world has had growth rates that have, by recent standards, been very impressive because it has been prepared to undertake fundamental reform, particularly fundamental reform of the labour market. That is where we will come to terms with these problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government is serious about wanting to get the unskilled, the marginalised and the disadvantaged back into the work force, it will do it by freeing up the labour market. It will do it in a way that makes it attractive and rewarding for employers to be able to afford to take those people on. It certainly will not do it by adding another $6 billion to payroll tax in the form of compulsory superannuation at 3 per cent over the next few years. That will simply drive up the unemployment figures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Max Walsh said recently that he regarded such a proposal as little short of economic lunacy. He could not understand why the former Treasurer had completely lost touch with economic responsibilities since relinquishing his role. I do not know whether this reflects the advice he has been getting but I suppose that his silence since he got that bucketing is evidence of the fact that he knows that a compulsory superannuation scheme of that magnitude is a recipe for employment disaster.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a very sorry tale. I will be fascinated to hear Senator Richardson's justification. I am sure that he will not be claiming any credit. In many respects, the other side of the Senate is littered with those who have never had to work for a living, who have always been able to operate in the sheltered workshop environment of the Labor Party secretariats. We have something like nine or 10 ex-Labor Party secretaries and apparatchiks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson's definition of social justice presumably involves the sorts of recent escapades we have seen where $1,000 is chalked up a night in a hotel in London. When he was asked what his excuse was, the best he could say was, `Well, that's amazing. The last time I stayed there it cost only $500 a night'. A mere $130,000 was spent during three trips over nine months, and all this in the middle of the greatest recession since the Depression! If that is his definition of social justice, I would have thought that he would desperately need some professional advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are serious about social justice, if we are serious about getting employment levels up again, we must make a new start-not the sort of false dawn that the Government is proposing by way of its compulsion which will boost the numbers of CES bureaucrats and the like but a truly flexible labour market, one that will provide significant long term opportunities for people who desperately want to get into the work force but simply cannot.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can assure Senator Richardson and the Senate that we are committed to fundamental reforms, to a workplace environment where people will be able to compete effectively and where those who are not prepared to work or to look hard enough will find their benefits being cut off. But the vast majority who are interested in work and who do want access to labour market programs will be able to have it. I hope, at the very least, that we will get an admission that the last 8 1/2 years have been a tragic failure, that they have been the very opposite of a delivery of the concept of social justice and that, indeed, it is time for a new start.

         —The concept of social justice is oft debated in parliaments. But the understanding of it sometimes lags a long way behind debate and that, sadly, has always been the case with this Opposition and remains so today. When we are having this kind of debate, it is particularly disappointing that Senator Alston should allude to `the sheltered workshops of Labor Party offices'; I certainly will not. The last time a politician-he was a friend of mine-used an analogy of that kind, he was very rightly criticised by disabled groups all around the country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Alston ought to know better. I am surprised, given that he has had over 12 months in the shadow portfolio, that he would be silly enough to make that kind of analogy. But we will let disabled groups make up their own minds about him; of course, many of them have-and I shall refer to that a little later.
       </para>
       <para>
        First off, in looking at the unemployment statistics to which Senator Alston and Senator Walters referred during the course of Question Time, I declined to read out the eight dot points that the ABS used to explain the difference between its statistics and the statistics of the Department of Social Security. I have always been under the impression that the honourable senators to whom I referred would be literate enough to manage them on their own. But clearly the statistics show a number of unemployed in Australia that is very high, indeed. This is something of regret to us all.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth while noting that even during the course of a recession-an admittedly tough recession-Australia has been spending something like $1 billion a month more than the value of what it produces. That is a sobering figure, I would have thought, for us all. Clearly, a way to get around that can only come with the establishment of a real manufacturing base in Australia and policies that will lead to proper international competition. What that all means in the end is that Australia will have to earn its future. It will not come as easily as it did in past decades. Reliance on commodities and agriculture is never going to be good enough again.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I would hate to be branded a heretic for departing from some Labor orthodoxy, I do not blame the Fraser and Howard regimes for that problem. They did not do anything about it; they did not try to fix it. But I do not blame them for the problem; that problem goes back some decades. Attempting to sort out the real problems of the 1950s and 1960s caused by McEwen and Menzies will take Australia a long time indeed, irrespective of who governs. But someone has to sit down and actually start that ball rolling and that is what this Government has done.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is really up for debate is the kind of safety net that is put in place by the Government for those people who are unemployed. We heard Senator Alston make some references to a safety net but those references have been characteristically vague. On 5 July this year, at least he came a little closer to being specific. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        You've got to understand that our approach to unemployment is quite different from the Government. We take the view that you shouldn't be on benefits indefinitely.
       </para>
       <para>
        That, of course, is the nub of the problem. Senator Alston pretended for a while that those who were going off unemployment benefit, after whatever period he decided they were not serious about work, would be getting special benefits. That pretence is gradually being dropped. Mr Reith, of course, never even maintained it. He was happy to drop it straight away. We have never been given an explanation of where the $3 billion in cuts in welfare are going to come from and how those cuts will be made. We have waited a long time for a policy to come out of the Opposition on this question. We have not got one; we are still waiting.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was staggered by Senator Alston's reference to being strong on policy. He has not yet been able to come up with one. I would challenge Senator Alston to tell us exactly where these cuts are to come from. I challenge him to tell us how social justice in Australia would be advanced by a $3 billion cut in the welfare budget. I wonder who will suffer from the $3 billion cut. One thing is for sure: it will not be those who attend Liberal Party conferences. Those well-heeled people will not be the ones under attack.
       </para>
       <para>
        For a party that professes today a commitment to social justice, one wonders how many social security beneficiaries ever attend Liberal Party conferences. I suspect that the answer to that is very few indeed. When they turn up at our conferences, they come as delegates because we are of them and they are among us. So we do tend to know a little more than Senator Alston about what affects them and the kinds of solutions that they would seek.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to turn to some of the matters that Senator Alston has raised today. While I would have to confess to some depression about unemployment figures, I think really two questions have to be asked as we head out of the recession. They are: firstly, what sort of economy will we have when we recover and, secondly, what sort of commitment does the Government have to the needs of those who have suffered during the recession and who will continue to suffer for some time yet?
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer to the first question is that we will have an economy which is to a far greater degree driven by an improved manufacturing base and by international competitiveness. That is also underscored by the fact that we will have one of the lowest inflation rates in the OECD. That gives Australia a very real opportunity over the next few years, provided that it is not spoilt by the introduction of a consumption tax and an immediate jump in our inflation rate so that we lose that competitive edge. This economy has become more and more open to international markets. It is no longer governed by that conservative dogma of protection and reliance on commodity prices. We can give Australia a real chance, provided some of the necessary decisions can be taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second question is: what sort of commitment will the Government have, or would any government have, to those who are coming out of the recession and who have suffered during it? I have to say that the record of the Government on this question is one of which I am justifiably proud. We have taken positive and definite steps to try to help those who have been hurt by this recession and we continue to do so. Not for us the nostalgic look, the gaze through rose coloured glasses to the Thatcherite or Reaganite models of welfare of those opposite. Those opposite have a superior view which seeks to blame the poor for their predicament and punish them with a system which will only further condemn them to poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        In looking back with rose coloured glasses on Mrs Thatcher's rule in Britain, it should be noted that between the years of 1985 and 1989 there was a jump of 53 per cent in the numbers of those living in poverty. There are vast ghettos of poverty in the great cities of Britain. In some areas of Glasgow, Britons live in Third World conditions. Britain is one of the G7 nations, one of the top economies of the world. What happened to social welfare and what happened to the safety net are questions that the Opposition will not seek to answer.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of Reaganite models, the idea that individual States would control welfare has meant that in the US the States are actually pulling out-reducing welfare payments-so that they do not get people moving into their States. That strikes me as a pretty sad situation. Those sorts of solutions are not for this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this point I will mention Senator Alston's continual reference to the need to hand over some aspects of social security to welfare agencies. Quite recently, Senator Alston attended a conference in Sydney organised by the Social Policy Research Centre at which he put some of these views. Fortunately, I have listened to a tape of those proceedings taken by one of the participants. The reception that Senator Alston received should have given him some inkling of just how tough it was for him.
       </para>
       <para>
        The welfare agencies totally reject the line that these functions can be handed over to them. In fact, they rejected that very strongly and quite vocally at the conference. When it came to a discussion of the special benefit and what happens with the income test, Senator Alston was in real strife because he simply did not know the answers. In fact, he got laughed at, not with. That was in front of the creme de la creme of those who will be participating in discussions with him during the course of his shadow ministry-however long that might last. That suggests a rocky road indeed for Senator Alston. However, it will be no rockier than that which he has so far endured.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will mention some of the advances that have been made during the eight years of the Hawke Labor Government for those who are on social security benefits and pensions, because they are the ones who have to be caught by this safety net. They are the ones who know the real meaning of social justice. For them, it is worth noting that there has been a 13.7 per cent increase for married pensioners and beneficiaries without children; a 17 per cent increase for married pensioners and beneficiaries with two children aged six to 12; a 25.7 per cent increase for married pensioners and beneficiaries with children aged 13 to 15; a 19.3 per cent increase for sole parent pensioners with two children aged six to 12; and a 31.5 per cent increase for sole parent pensioners with children aged between 13 and 15. Those increases are all real increases; they all take inflation into account. These are massive gains for those on fixed incomes at the bottom end of the income scale. They are the gains that this Government has delivered and will continue to deliver.
       </para>
       <para>
        Low income workers have also benefited from very significant real increases in their disposable incomes. These have been delivered by a combination of taxation reform and social security policy changes. A single person with no children and earning 75 per cent of total average weekly earnings for all persons has experienced a 3.2 per cent rise in real disposable income.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a 9.3 per cent real increase for single income couples with two children under the age of 13, again if they are earning 75 per cent of average weekly earnings. There has been a 5.1 per cent real increase for a dual income couple with two children under the age of 13 and earning that same percentage of average weekly earnings. These are very significant increases for low income families and they have been achieved over a long period of time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increases for low income families with children are overwhelmingly due to very large real increases in the family allowance supplement, previously the family income supplement. Those increases amount to 54.3 per cent for children under the age of 13, and 125 per cent for children aged 13 to 15. Again, those are real increases, inflation having being taken into account. These are extraordinary rises.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one goes right through the benefit levels and takes into account the increases we have had in rent assistance, which again in some places reaches 100 per cent, these extraordinary increases demonstrate a commitment to social justice year after year by this Government for those who are in need of a social security net.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, in the course of a recession, with the Newstart program beginning on 1 July, we have very real opportunities for training for the unemployed. They can use the time during the recession to make sure that while they are unemployed their skills are improving so that they can benefit as soon as the recession is over. They are the ones who will reap the gains when the recession is over; they are the ones who will get the jobs. That situation benefits individuals and, of course, it also benefits the nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the problems we have had is the level of skill in the work force. The skilling of our work force needs upgrading urgently. The Newstart program will guarantee that that occurs. There are hundreds of millions of dollars now being spent on training programs as a result of what was announced in the March statement and next week there will be further announcements of increases. Obviously, I cannot announce those; however, I think that they will be received very well indeed next week.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increases that I have referred to and the establishment of the Newstart program for those who are unfortunate enough to be out of a job demonstrate the Government's type of social justice. When we contrast that with the type of social justice that the Opposition would have, we see that there really is still a stark difference between the Government and the Opposition-a huge gulf, a gap that is growing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already referred to the Opposition's proposed $3 billion saving from cuts in welfare expenditure. There is no doubt about who will suffer when people try to rip that out of welfare and out of the hands of those who can least afford it. Even after 15 months, the Opposition has not had the guts-the courage-to come out and tell us which areas will be cut, who will suffer the knife. No-one yet knows. Those opposite talk about the figure of $3 billion. It is easy to get the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to say the figure, but it is very hard to get him to put down on paper any areas that are due for the chop.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I were an unemployed person, a sole parent pensioner or one of the millions of battlers in this country, I would know that, if the Opposition were to form a government, those cuts would be falling on me. That knife would be going right through my standard of living. Sadly for the Opposition, that will be the problem during the lead-up to the next election, because not only will it have to explain what it has had to--

She might be aware that the Opposition is still saying that it will try to abolish the capital gains tax. That is an extraordinary statement from those who claim social justice. If one is well-heeled, if one is doing well in this community and can get capital gains, the Liberal Party says, `No tax-you are fixed'.

        What the Liberal Party says to anyone who is unemployed, to any social welfare beneficiary, is, `You will be cut, and you will be cut savagely'. That is the contrast the Liberal Party can never get over. When it comes to a consumption tax it gets much worse. Over the course of the next two years it will be fascinating. We will probably hear the phrase `in due course' again because we have had no details of the consumption tax either. How the Opposition compensates all of those pensioners, all of those unemployed, is something we want to know. The problem for the Opposition will not be simply about social welfare beneficiaries. It will be a big problem for the National Party to try to explain to the 140,000 farmers, and a big problem for the Liberal Party to try to explain to the 400,000 self-employed persons who have been identified by the Social Policy Research Centre as having incomes above that which would be compensated, how they can be compensated for this tax. There are half a million taxpayers in Australia-mind you, overwhelmingly part of the Liberal-National Party base vote-who cannot be compensated under a consumption tax. I will be fascinated to see the squirming of the National Party over the next few months on that issue. It will hear a lot about it. I will also be fascinated to see the champions of small business on the Opposition benches explain to the self-employed why they cannot be compensated. It will be interesting to see how long the courageous lot on the other side can hang on!

         —I rise firstly to support the motion moved by Senator Alston which is before us today. The only small question the Australian Democrats had was whether this Government had deliberately created the massive job losses. On looking at its present reaction to the incredibly large numbers now on unemployment benefits-the very large numbers who have lost their jobs and the way in which it has reacted to that-one sees that it basically has not reacted. There seems to be no inclination on the part of the Government to move directly to assist those people by creating jobs. We have therefore come to the conclusion that, yes, it must have been deliberate. We will therefore be supporting this motion.

        However, I rise to speak with some cynicism. Whilst there is no doubt that the Government's economic policies are causing great hardship, the fact of the matter is that the Opposition has not put forward one single policy which would turn the situation around and reduce unemployment. In fact, other than hawking around its consumption tax and trying to convince everyone what a wonderful idea it is, there is not one thing the Opposition is offering the country that is substantially different from the medicine which the Government has now been dishing out for some years.

I refer in particular to those who are now not able to work, whether they have lost their jobs, whether their small businesses have folded or whether they have been forced off their farms. The Opposition has not shown the slightest concern for social justice issues as they affect the 900,000 to one million Australians who are now out of work.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is pretty audacious of Senator Alston to come in here and talk of justice and people who are on the economic margins of society, the economically vulnerable, when in the last session we had to sit here and watch the Opposition vote with the Government to pass its Newstart legislation. We have not heard anything at all from the Opposition today that looks at the disastrous social justice consequences of the Government's proposed changes to invalid pensions and sickness benefits. That piece of legislation is due to be debated in this chamber any day now. Senator Alston needs to realise that it will be very difficult for Australians to take this sudden concern with social justice from the Opposition very seriously when it has colluded with the Government in recent years on a number of measures that have quite clearly done nothing to advance the cause of social justice in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I keep pointing out time and time again, I have watched the Opposition support the Government on such measures as the significant reduction in income support for young unemployed people and young homeless people; the introduction of the liquid assets test on unemployment and sickness beneficiaries; reductions in the rent allowance; the introduction of a $2.50 prescription charge for pensioners; the introduction of a new series of hurdles, plus the power of compulsion, in Newstart; the refusal to support exemptions for family farms and the family allowance supplement; and the refusal to support the disallowance of the Austudy regulations which would have led to the exemption of the family farm from the Austudy assets test and a better deal for all students. The list goes on and on.
       </para>
       <para>
        I again stress that the Opposition has continually aided and abetted the Government through its social security program, putting into place its privatisation policies and its economic policies. Many of these measures have helped further entrench many Australian families in poverty. To look at what the Opposition is planning, I refer to the current issue of the Bulletin magazine published on 13 August. Senator Alston was interviewed on what the coalition would do if in government with regard to welfare policies. The article in the Bulletin states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the protests of a Hawke government that says it has cut back as far as human dignity will permit, shadow minister Richard Alston sees ``considerable scope to reduce the numbers of people who are needlessly on welfare''. He plans a profound crackdown that will see an unapologetic microscope pulled over most areas in the $24 billion portfolio. He says it is ``verging on a scandal'' that so many people who claim sickness benefits or the invalid pension get it when they are ``only marginally affected'' and claims reforms in this area could net ``several hundred millions of dollars'' in savings. Tougher new medical test rules will be introduced to assess cases.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wonder whether Senator Alston has looked at the Bill currently before the Senate-the Government's Bill, which puts new tests and new tables in place which now will be the only criteria on which a person can get the disability support pension. The criteria are so strict that they will cut out thousands of people and prevent thousands of Australians from accessing this benefit. Indeed, in a couple of cases they are untried anywhere in the world. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        A Hewson government would make unemployment benefits available for nine months only, after which the recipient would have to satisfy an ``activity test'' that he or she was out trying to get work, in order to continue to receive ``special benefits''.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask Senator Alston whether he has seen how tight the activity test already is for those people who are trying to get unemployment benefits. And it does not end there. I ask Senator Alston: where is the justice in denying people in need access to fully qualified social workers? I refer here to his proposal that only volunteers working through welfare agencies would be giving the necessary support by way of counselling rather than, as is the case now, the Government providing counselling to disabled people looking for work, to teenagers and to single parents wanting to re-enter the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only today we read of another Liberal policy, this time specifically in South Australia, where it is planned that, under a Liberal Government, unemployed youths will be living in compulsory camps, weeding national parks, building railways and catching rabbits and feral cats. This plan has been proposed by Mr Peter Lewis, the Liberal member for Murray-Mallee. Where is the social justice in that? Yes, young people desperately want work, but not in a concentration camp-type situation. By all means, get these jobs done-they are desperately needed-but let us provide the money through the National Parks and Wildlife Service in various States and offer work to young people. They will be queuing up. I can assure the Senate that the jobs will be filled within a couple of days. The less well-off members of our society might be interested to know exactly what is Senator Alston's definition of social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have heard some comments from Senator Richardson about the Liberal Party's consumption tax proposals. I wish to comment briefly on this in the short time available to me today. The change proposed by the Opposition is a package which is even more regressive than merely an increase in the indirect tax base. As well as taxing food, funerals, car repairs, football matches, cinema attendance, health services and education, the Opposition plans to either abolish or severely reduce the capital gains tax and cut the maximum marginal income tax rate. It seems very likely that it will be lowering company tax and abolishing the training levy. From comments that Senator Alston made today, it seems that superannuation is also in the firing line.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard specifically to the goods and services tax, the poor consume all of their income-they spend it all on goods and services. Because they do, a goods and services tax is regressive, as proportionally it falls much harder on the low income group. The Opposition says, `Don't worry about that. We will compensate'. But, sensibly, very few Australians believe it. While it is possible to increase benefits for those who are in the system-and I stress again that under a Liberal government there would be far fewer people on benefits and within the system-how are those people who now, or who will, fall through the system going to be compensated? The public debate, as yet, has not covered the need to compensate students who receive Austudy or Abstudy. How can we become the clever country when our students are living below the poverty line?
       </para>
       <para>
        We still do not know the coalition's policy on indexation of benefits and allowances. It may be prepared to provide a one-off increase, but if they are not indexed, those who are receiving them will be even harder hit. Those who are on low, fixed incomes which are not in any way Government benefits-for example, small business people who are struggling to make ends meet, farmers and superannuants-will be drastically disadvantaged by this consumption tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at superannuants. Firstly, all their savings, which are to supplement retirement income, will be instantly devalued. Secondly, their superannuation pensions or annuities will not be increased to take into account the increased prices. Low income earners who want to be home buyers will be further disadvantaged because all building materials will be subject to tax. I could go on and on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another reason-and there are many more-why the Democrats oppose a consumption tax is market preference for ecologically sustainable practices. The current system grants sales tax exemption for recycled paper. This has created a massive, growing, ecologically sound, export-oriented Australian industry. The elimination of the sales tax differential between recycled and ordinary paper would affect the relative position of recycled paper in the market. The same applies to solar hot water services and photovoltaic devices. We would like to increase the number of exemptions to include recycled plastics, electric motor vehicles and a large number of other items.
       </para>
       <para>
        One final point on social justice is the rights and interests of disabled people. They also currently enjoy a large number of exemptions from sales tax for vital equipment to assist them in their daily lives. I could go on with regard to charities, nursing homes and educational institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        None of this is to let the Government off the hook-far from it. In the short time left to me I want to look briefly at one of the more scandalous things that this Government has done in the area of social security, and that is the reduction in income support for young people. Not only has it created a climate in which it is extremely difficult for young people to get a job or to hold on to a job, but also it has already reduced young people to a point well below the poverty line.
       </para>
       <para>
        The average person may think it would make more sense to raise the education allowance than to bring all other allowances down to that very meagre, minimal level. As we read our papers and listen to the radio, we hear more and more of the increased crime rates amongst young people. We are being told by criminologists and psychologists that a large part of the reason is that young people who are out of work do not have enough to live on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only that, but we also have the Government blithely sailing on with what can at best be called a highly dubious policy, and moving to cut back on the last remaining group of young people who still have a reasonable income, and that is the young, disabled people-those people who, by definition, cannot work. Under social security legislation now before this Parliament young, disabled people will have their incomes significantly reduced. What will this mean to them, to their families and to the care givers? It will mean even further disadvantages for these already disadvantaged young people. Where is the social justice in that?
       </para>
       <para>
        I will briefly go through the figures: 9.8 per cent officially unemployed-some 830,000 Australians officially out of work, with the Government saying that we could well reach 900,000 people out of work by Christmas. These figures are only the tip of the iceberg. They fail to reveal the extent of misery and hardship that this recession is causing for Australian families.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have heard virtually nothing from the Government that indicates that the message is getting through to it. As individual senators or members, backbenchers or Ministers, we hear more of the same about deregulation and the need for high interest rates. There are no new ideas about directly tackling record levels of unemployment. Actually to put up some alternatives is almost seen as heresy. We must keep talking, it seems, using all the jargon about free markets, deregulation, keeping interest rates up and lowering taxes. To be part of the economic debate in this country, one is expected not to mention those nasty words `full employment', and somehow to accept that we will always have to put up with a substantial level of unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats do not accept that this is where Australia should be heading. We are not talking just about statistics and arguing about which statistical table we should be looking at. We are talking about people whose lives are being directly affected and damaged by Government policies. It is about time that we heard some fresh ideas from the Government, and that the Government started showing a bit of leadership on these issues and actually allowed some debate to occur within its own ranks as well as in the wider community. I conclude by saying that this Government does stand condemned, but it could not have done the things for which it is being condemned without the assistance of Senator Alston.

         —Thus far, this has been a particularly interesting debate because it shows the different perspectives of the major parties and of the Australian Democrats, about whom I wish to make some specific remarks. We are debating an urgency motion put forward by Senator Alston, namely:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The need to condemn the Government for deliberately creating massive job losses and unemployment through its disastrous economic policies which have made a mockery of its professed concern for social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to this matter Senator Lees has said, `What are you going to do? I haven't heard anything from you'. That is what she has said to the coalition. She listed a number of Government policies on which we have supported the Government, and made a quantum leap to say we are equally culpable in this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I have to say to the Democrats and to other interested honourable senators is that social justice is a nice motherhood word. I think Labor invented it, and wants to jump behind it at every opportunity it can. `We have a social justice program'. Who could not be in favour of that? It is perceived to mean a fairer system. That is all it means.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no magic in social justice. It is just a highfalutin way of one saying that things should be fairer than they are now. No-one I know disagrees with that. The Opposition has a different approach to creating a fairer system for everybody. In these debates Senator Lees is always talking about giving more money. I might phrase it another way-she is complaining about cutting down on Government spending and says that we should not be so harsh in this respect. The Democrats' approach to these matters is that, if there is a problem, we should throw money at the people involved-through welfare benefits or whatever-and that problem will be solved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The mistake the Democrats make is in believing that the problem will be solved. The problem may be alleviated, but it will not be solved. I suppose that is the luxury of a speech from a member of a party which will never be in government, will never be responsible for taking the reins of government, and will never be responsible for implementing its policies. Senator Lees was at pains to say that she had not heard any proposals from the coalition about what it was going to do. I did not hear any proposals from her about what the Democrats would do. If one is going to criticise, then one should have some idea of what one is going to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees says that all we talk about is a goods and services tax. Before getting on to the substance of what I want to deal with, there are some remarks I would like to make to the Democrats in that respect. They say that a consumption tax is a bad thing. I remind them that we already have a consumption tax-we have a wholesale sales tax. The Democrats need to decide why they continue to support a hidden wholesale sales tax. When we go to the shops, unless we are familiar with a whole range of wholesale sales tax legislation, we do not know how much we are paying.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why are the Democrats prepared to support a hidden tax with high and variable rates where some things are not taxed, some are taxed at 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent, and there is no rhyme or reason between them? I think carbonated mineral water is taxed and uncarbonated mineral water is not; televisions are taxed but some other entertainment goods are not; caravans are taxed but travel to Broome is not. It seems quite irrational.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats need to explain why they support an irrational wholesale sales tax system. Why do they say that people who manufacture goods should have the extra price inbuilt into their product but people who deliver services and sell their services for a living should not be so disadvantaged? Let them say why they support that system and why, in principle, that is a better way to go. Let them say why they think it is a good thing that our business inputs are continually taxed. Despite some moves by the Government to allow some exemptions, our business inputs are, nonetheless, taxed. Let them explain why that is a good thing when jobs for Australians depend on our industries being competitive. Furthermore, Senator Lees should say why she makes the assumption that it is impossible to compensate or offset for such a policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I see that Senator Maguire is speaking later in this debate. I welcome an explanation from him about the newsletter he put out, which made outrageous allegations of what the coalition was going to do. If the Government ever introduces truth in advertising and extends it to electoral newsletters, Senator Maguire is in very deep, hot water. If he wants to come into this debate with clean hands, let him first answer for the veracity of the remarks he made in his newsletter to his-I imagine-ever decreasing bunch of Labor followers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Returning to the theme of social justice, this Government is quick to claim as one of its policies that it believes in fairness. That does not distinguish it from anybody here. As far as I can tell, everybody in this chamber believes that we should be trying to develop a fairer system. It is interesting that Marc Lombard from Macquarie University made a study of what has happened to the so-called rich and poor under Labor. He discovered that under Labor the top 10 per cent of income earners are massively increasing their share of the cake. For example, the top 10 per cent of income earners in 1982-83-regrettably that is when the coalition lost government-had a 21.8 per cent share of the cake. In 1988-89, after a few years of Labor, their slice of the cake had shifted up to 26.63 per cent. On the other hand, the share of the cake for the bottom percentage had reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the most telling of all is that in 1982-83 the top one per cent of income earners shared just under 4 per cent of our national income. In 1988-89 they had much closer to 8 per cent of the national income. Under Labor's social justice programs the rich get a lot richer.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the story becomes even worse: not only did the share of the cake going to the top one per cent of income earners increase massively-nearly doublefold-but the percentage of their own income paid in tax decreased dramatically. When the coalition was in government, the top one per cent, who were then earning about 4 per cent of the cake, paid about a quarter of that in tax. Now, under Labor, they are earning nearly 8 per cent of the cake but paying only about 3.4 per cent of their portion in tax. If Senator Lees wants to say she thinks that is a delivery of social justice, well and good, but I do not think it is at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The points I want to make thus far are these: we have seen a different approach in this debate. The Democrats basically say, `If there is a problem, throw money at it. If you do not throw money at it, you must be mean, you cannot be in favour of fairness'. That is a very simplistic line which is easy to run on talkback radio, but it is not the way to run a country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government says, `People really are better off under us'. We say that is absolute rubbish. The rising numbers of unemployed do not feel that they are better off under this Government. It has been said before and bears repeating that, irrespective of what the unemployment rate is, an unemployed person is 100 per cent unemployed, and the achievement of lower inflation at the price of unemployment is not acceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy President, I remind you of what this Government said when it first came to office. In 1983, Ralph Willis, the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the man responsible for the Government's performance, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an acceptance of high unemployment by no-one on this side. Unlike the previous Government, which could blithely go along tolerating continuously increasing levels of unemployment, we regard those kinds of policies as utterly and totally repugnant.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are within one per cent of the highest point of unemployment in that 1982-83 recession; in other words, we are back to where we started in terms of unemployment. What does this Government say about it? What is it going to do about it? Nothing, as far as we can tell. Senator Lees says that all she has heard is the discussion on the goods and services tax. She has not been listening. There are a number of things we want to introduce and it has been described as a 12-point plan. This side of the chamber will not be going to the next election with whiz-bang, whistle policies promising that no child will be in poverty, promising that this particular sector will be looked after, and promising more grants for this little sector to buy them off and more grants for that little sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will be going with a complete package and basically saying to the Australian community, `Look, it is not working at the moment. The whole system we have simply is not working'. To try to buy off different sectors with a few little packages of whiz-bang goodies is not going to solve the problem. There is a whole range of things that needs to be done, not the least of which is tax reform. The goods and services tax is just a part of that. We need lower income tax so people can decide more for themselves how they are going to spend their money. Rather than the Government keeping their money and giving it back to them in some form of benefit, it is much better that they keep their money and spend it as they choose.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees seems to gloss over labour market reform; she seems to be saying there is nothing in it. When I first came to this Parliament John Howard was laughed at when he said that Australia needed to have enterprise-based bargaining; he was regarded as some voodoo doctor peddling a plan that would never work. Some six years later the Government has adopted his proposal. In fact, even within the existing legislation one can have a form of enterprise bargaining-something that five years ago was incomprehensible; people could not accept that it would happen. However, until we reform the labour market, until we get to the stage when people can negotiate for themselves and until we break out of the system where the big boys-big government, big unions and big business-decide what is happening in this country, until we break that nexus, there will not be an increase in opportunities for people to market their own goods and seize opportunities as they choose.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees also referred to the Newstart program; she criticised the Government for it. I do not think it is unreasonable to say, `Yes, if you are genuinely unemployed, we will give you money'. Equally, I do not think it is unreasonable to say that after 12 months of being unemployed a new arrangement must be entered into. One cannot just announce to other taxpayers that one is unemployed and therefore put one's hand out. That is all that is being changed. People are being asked to do as they can for the first 12 months and then, because it is not an indefinite program, arrangements will have to be made after that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition supports the Government's Newstart scheme and says that in part it does not go far enough. That does not mean the Government is cutting genuine welfare; it means it is making a sensible arrangement with the people who are getting welfare and is ensuring that none of the welfare dollar is spent on people who are not trying as hard as they can to get a job. In saying that, I do not mean that I believe that 90 per cent of the unemployed are in that position at all but, even if we find only 2 per cent of people collecting a benefit who should not be collecting it, we have to understand that those people are stealing from other taxpayers and are limiting our capacity to pay a decent benefit to genuinely unemployed people. If people are too chicken to come into this Parliament and say they want to weed out the people who are unfairly taking a benefit, in my view, they should not take a seat in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will turn quickly to the 12 things the Liberal Party of Australia thinks need to be done. The Opposition believes some price stability needs to be introduced into the Australian market; a reform of Commonwealth-State relations is long overdue; we need to look at the protection of industry, which has encouraged us to have such inefficient industries for so long; we need labour market reform; we need taxation reform; we need to look at our ever-dwindling infrastructure because this Government cannot be bothered spending any money on it; we need to cut government expenditure because taxpayers are sick of paying for government to do things that they believe private enterprise could do better; we need to offer more services to private enterprise in a way that will enable it to compete and to allow it, rather than the Government, to use the taxpayers' money; we need to streamline our development applications so that people who want to make a buck and progress in this country can get a decent and easy answer about whether they can go ahead with their projects rather than being strung out for months on end and then being told no; we need to review what we are going to do with immigration; we need to improve our education system, instead of locking people out as they have been under the elitist policies of this Government; and, lastly, we need to improve our international standing. If those 12 things are achieved, Australia will be a much better place. (Time expired)

         —This afternoon the chamber is debating an urgency motion on unemployment moved by the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I oppose this motion because it is a very selective one which focuses on one aspect of the Australian economy at the present time. It certainly ignores the one million-plus new jobs created under the present Administration. The creation of those jobs under the Hawke Labor Government was perhaps the most important social justice measure seen in Australia in the 1980s.
       </para>
       <para>
        This motion focuses on the jobless figures released last week and ignores the other economic news released by the official organisations in Australia at the same time. It ignores the healthy economic news and the good economic indicators that came out during last week. It ignores Australia's lower inflation figure and the fact that the lowest annual rate of price rises in Australia since 1970 was recorded up to June this year. That was a wonderful achievement and proves that the Government is getting the economic fundamentals right in the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The motion ignores the profound improvement in the Australian balance of payments; our overseas trading account has improved enormously and, most importantly, there has been an 8 per cent growth in exports. Those facts have been ignored in the motion moved here today by the Liberals. Members of the Liberal Party will not debate inflation or price rises in the Australian economy; they run away from debating those subjects on every possible occasion because they simply have no policies or answers on the questions of prices and price stability in the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have only to look at the Liberals' record in government during those eight long years from 1975 to 1983 to see the Liberals' record on inflation. Time after time in that period the Liberals went to the Australian people during election campaigns saying, `If elected, our policy would be to fight inflation first'. That is what the Liberals said time and time again during the 1970s and the early 1980s- `We will fight inflation first'-but when they left office after eight years Australia had double digit inflation and price rises of 11.5 per cent up to the March quarter in 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today the previous speaker in the debate, Senator Vanstone from South Australia, had the nerve to say that one of the 12 points in the Liberal Party's so-called charter is price stability. The Liberals want to have price stability, yet by the time they left office in 1983 all they could bring inflation down to was 11.5 per cent. Under the Hawke Labor Government prices are now rising by only 3.4 per cent; in other words, less than one-third of the figure the Liberals were able to deliver. That is the sort of reality Australia is facing; all we have to do with conservative politicians is look at their record, because that exposes them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might say that the 3.4 per cent rise in prices to June this year is well below the average rise in costs for our trading partners and certainly compares very favourably with the average of 6.2 per cent of the industrialised countries of the world as measured by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Australia's figures, by comparison, are very favourable indeed. It is important to note that recent falls in price increases in Australia have been linked carefully and closely to the falls in interest rates that have occurred in the economy. One good thing now happening is that inflation is bringing interest rates down and, because interest rates are now a component of the consumer price index, they in turn are bringing inflation down.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course we on this side of the Parliament are concerned about unemployment. We understand the community anxiety about the level of unemployment; we understand that many Australian employees have lost their livelihoods; we know that it is a very uncomfortable time for many Australian families and we can certainly see-from looking at reports on the Australian work force-that full time male employees, for example, have been hit very hard by the current recession. Last week's unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent is nearly up to the level of 1982-83, when Australia experienced its most severe recession since World War II.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to note that what is actually happening in the economy at present does not reflect the policies now in place; because there are time-lags in economic systems, it reflects the policies of the past. Today's high unemployment figures reflect past, not current, policies; in fact, there are long time lags-months can go by-between a change in policy and the impact on the real economy and on jobs. In fact the unemployment figures of today stem from policies that were in place at the beginning of last year. At the beginning of 1990 Australia had high interest rates-the overnight cash rate was 18 per cent-and a very tight monetary policy was in place. Australia at that stage had a very restrictive fiscal policy, as measured by the difference between government revenue and government spending, and it had a very large Budget surplus in 1989-90 of $8 billion. The conjunction of tight fiscal and monetary policies had the objective of reducing demand for imports from overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the problem that the Liberals are not talking about today. These policies were put in place to stem the tide of imports into this country because we did not have the wherewithal to pay for them. We tightened spending in the Australian community in order to cut off the excess demand for imports; we stopped the spill-over from the Australian economy to imports. Certainly, the policies that were in place last year did not have some arbitrary focus-as the Liberals and the National Party suggest today-of deliberately raising unemployment. They were designed to deal with this fundamental problem that existed with Australia's external account and the excess demand for imports which occurred because Australian production was not keeping up with the level of spending in the Australian community and the demand had to go overseas to be met.
       </para>
       <para>
        The balance of payments situation is showing improvement. The balance of payments figure for the financial year 1990-91 was released last week. The Liberal's motion ignores totally the balance of payment figures released last week which showed a deficit on the current account of some $15.3 billion compared with the figure in the previous financial year of over $22 billion. So there has been a substantial improvement in Australia's external account as a result of the policies of this Government. Very importantly, there has been an 8 per cent rise in Australian exports during 1990-91 compared with the previous financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen substantial cuts in interest rates. I mentioned the 18 per cent cash interest rates at the beginning of last year; those rates have been reduced substantially on a number of occasions to the point where we now have official cash rates of 10 1/2 per cent. So there has been a 7 1/2-percentage point reduction in official interest rates over the last 15 to 18 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the sectors where reduced interest rates should have some impact in the coming months is the housing sector of the Australian economy. Last financial year there were 120,000 new dwelling commencements in Australia. I note that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is forecasting 134,000 housing starts this year. Of course, housing is a very labour-intensive sector of the Australian economy and those extra housing starts should help to boost economic activity. They are some of the important things that are happening.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also note that the 120,000 housing starts last year-and during the last financial year the Liberals kept saying that we were in the worst recession since World War II-compare with the Opposition's figure of only 105,000 new dwelling commencements in 1982-83. That puts the economic situation into some perspective.
       </para>
       <para>
        The more relaxed monetary and fiscal policies have helped to lower price inflation in the Australian economy. That lower rate of cost increases is taking the pressure off many family budgets and it is certainly helping to keep living costs down for Australian families.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will take up the wording of this motion and address the indignation that the Liberals appear to have concerning social justice by linking inflation to social justice. One of the findings of a very important royal commission conducted in the United Kingdom was that high inflation really does reduce social justice. High inflation benefits people who tend to have their wealth tied up in assets which increase in value. Low inflation benefits those persons-almost always lower and middle income earners-who have their assets tied up in bank and building society deposits which do not increase in value; they only earn interest on those deposits. So by lowering inflation-and one of the great achievements of this Government is 3.4 per cent inflation-we are in fact tackling this very question of social justice directly by focusing more explicitly on the distribution of income. It is quite clear that high inflation tends to boost the value of those assets which do not have a fixed price and that tends to benefit higher income earners-those who have substantial wealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would now like to explore the policy differences between the Liberal Party and the Government on this question of the economy and jobs. Those opposite have moved this motion today condemning us for our role in the economy. What is different about their policies that would allow them to somehow wave their magic wand over the Australian economy and boost investment, production and jobs? What would they do about this economy that is different from what this Government has done?
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose we need to look at the Opposition's record in government; we need to look at what those opposite achieved the last time they were in government. I have already pointed to their double digit inflation-11 1/2 per cent price rises compared with 3.4 per cent now. Their record on unemployment was terrible: in 1982-83 unemployment was between 10 and 11 per cent of the available labour force. That is the record of those opposite. It is not a good base upon which to begin an analysis.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Opposition's major policy difference is in its proposal for a value added tax. Dr Hewson is hell-bent on taxing all expenditure in the Australian economy. Of course, we all know that the first thing a value added tax will do is kick-start inflation. We have gone through all of the pain and suffering of reducing inflation to 3 per cent; why on earth do we want a 15 per cent value added tax which will put 7 per cent on top of the consumer price index? Why do we want double digit inflation in the Australian economy again?
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask those opposite: how would this tax proposal benefit the creation of jobs? After all, it is a tax on spending and we all know that spending creates investment, production and employment. So how do those opposite propose that a consumption tax-this value added tax-will improve employment in the Australian economy? It is very clear that, in some cases, the tax will encourage people to buy more imported products and it will create a spill-over of spending from the Australian economy to imported products.
       </para>
       <para>
        I instance the case of luxury motor cars. Those opposite are proposing a Rolls Royce-led recovery. These are the people who want a limousine-led recovery. Let us look at this example: at the present time we tax luxury motor vehicles retailing for over $45,000 at a 30 per cent tax rate.

         —But if the Liberals bring in a 15 per cent value added tax the price of luxury motor vehicles will fall. That is self-evident. For example, a Mercedes 4-door sedan SE model, which retails for $99,600 at the moment, will fall substantially in price under these policies. This is a question that the Liberals cannot answer: will we have a tax inspector-led recovery?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The reality is that those opposite will need a massive number of inspectors in order to police this value added tax because it is a retail tax not a wholesale tax. At the present time there are only 75,000 taxpaying points in Australia under a wholesale tax. Those opposite want a retail tax and there are many more multiples of retailers than wholesalers in Australia. There are 750,000 retail outlets in Australia so there will be 10 times as much paperwork and 10 times as much red tape for small business. Those opposite are always going on about red tape for small business, yet they will have a tax inspector-led recovery. This is how they will do something about unemployment: they will have more tax inspectors in the Australian economy.

         —I will deal very briefly with Senator Maguire's quaint contribution. It was incredible that when I interjected to ask, `Is it a fact that the Labor Party's new car plan will bring a massive reduction in import duties on Rolls Royces and Mercedes?' Senator Maguire had no answer. That is where the big cut in the price of luxury cars will come from: Senator Maguire's Party's policy on the car industry. So we hear more bunkum from Senator Maguire who refuses to face the facts when they are put to him.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, one thing that fascinated me about Senator Maguire's contribution was his happy remark that today's unemployment figures relate to past policies-last year's policies. Guess whose they were? They were Mr Keating's policies; they are not the Government's policies. There is now a fall guy whom the Government can blame. Mr Keating's policies-last year's policies-are the reason for the present problem, not today's policies. Suddenly this Government has become pure by getting rid of Mr Keating. I suppose we could wonder where Senator Maguire lines up in the hold-Hawke or kick-Keating brigades.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was also intrigued to see that Senator Maguire concentrated on the wonderful improvement in Australia's economy. That followed the line used by Senator Evans today in his reply to a question of mine during Question Time. He claimed responsibility for the policies that brought down inflation. By the way, he did not add that inflation was brought down at the cost of a recession and job losses. This was a deliberately engineered-to quote Mr Keating-recession which produced engineered job losses. That is what we are talking about today. Our motion reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:
       </para>
       <para>
        The need to condemn the Government for deliberately creating massive job losses and unemployment through its disastrous economic policies which have made a mockery of its professed concern for social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the first time in a long time I agree with Senator Lees from the Australian Democrats. She asked the rhetorical question: maybe it was not deliberate-by inference, maybe it was simply incompetence. She sided, quite properly, with the view that it was deliberate because, as Mr Keating said, this was an engineered recession. However, this recession brought with it an incredible level of engineered unemployment, particularly for young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even worse than all this is the fact that Mr Keating is proud of his achievement. During the weekend he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very happy with the outcome of my period as Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        That outcome, as everyone knows, is the worst recession since the 1930s Depression. It is an outcome of record unemployment and record job losses, especially for young Australians; a record and still rising foreign debt, which requires more than $1 billion a month simply to service, so continuing Australia's disastrous balance of payments crisis with which Senator Maguire is quite happy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite our incredible recession, we still have horrendous balance of payments figures. And Senator Maguire thinks that is wonderful. Like Mr Keating, he regards them as a lovely set of figures. The unemployment rate is a lovely set of figures; the massive youth job loss rate is a lovely set of figures.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems incredible to me that the former Treasurer can express happiness at the misery that he has imposed. I guess I should not just refer to him because these were Government decisions. It is not the case, as Senator Maguire says, that these were last year's decisions and Keating was responsible for them. These were Government decisions which have imposed misery on so many honest Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will remember that during the 1990 election, a little less than a year and a half ago, the Government asked the people of Australia to have faith in it. In the 1990 Budget, this time last year, Mr Keating acknowledged the faith that Australians had in the Hawke-Keating Government by saying that that faith:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . is now being repaid as the economy adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth without a catastrophic collapse . . . employment will pick up . . . in short, the kind of outcome the government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not good enough for Senator Maguire to come in here and say, `Oh, they were last year's policies'. They were policies that this Government supported-policies which this Government said would bring about increased employment; policies which would not bring about a recession. In other words, either the Government was deliberately lying at the time or it was monumentally incompetent. I would have thought that Senator Maguire might have had the honesty to deal with what the Government said would happen as against the actual outcome, which is disastrous.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will remember that in 1983 Mr Hawke said that `no Australian government should ever be forgiven for creating the levels of youth unemployment of the last couple of years, which cannot and should not be tolerated'. He was, of course, referring to the Fraser Government. Yet now we have levels of youth unemployment, as measured by the number of young Australians aged 15 to 19 who cannot get a full time job, which are far greater than those that existed under the Fraser Government. I think this Government should be reminded of the way in which it played politics with youth unemployment at that time and its sudden submersing of any suggestion that somehow what is happening now is disgraceful.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an engineered recession. What happened in 1982-83, which has been exceeded now in terms of its extent, was certainly not engineered. It was a result of the worst drought for 50 years. Yet here we now have an engineered, a deliberately created, level of youth unemployment which exceeds the levels of 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just how bad are the facts? Those facts should be put on the record. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables, which I have referred to the Minister. One, which deals with the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate going back for the last 10 years, dramatises how horrific the present youth unemployment rate is. The other table, which relates to employed persons aged 15 to 19 in Australia, shows how jobs have been wiped out under this Government.

         —I thank the Senate. These figures reveal that 129,200 full time jobs in Australia have been wiped out over the last 12 months. That is the biggest 12-month loss ever recorded for young Australians. There are now only 301,100 15- to 19-year olds in full time work. Compared with 10 years ago under the Fraser Government, there are something like 236,000 fewer young Australians in full time work.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a result, youth unemployment has risen, seasonally adjusted, to 28.5 per cent, which is three times as large as the adult employment rate. It is the worst level for youth unemployment since the 1930s Depression. It far exceeds the 1983 recession peak of 27.6 per cent which Mr Hawke said, as honourable senators will remember, is a level which no government should ever be forgiven for creating. I stress that this level was created; it was engineered.
       </para>
       <para>
        I noted this morning- I will repeat it now-that the five Labor government States had the worst youth unemployment rates in Australia, while the Liberal-National Government in New South Wales managed to hold against the trend and had the lowest level of all States, which is still unacceptably high, of 25.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This disaster is not simply taking place in the area of youth unemployment. I might say that these figures do not reveal the full extent of the disaster. In the 12 months to July the total number of jobs lost in the Australian population was 337,000. At the same time, the population of those over 15 years of age increased by 227,000. When we combine the number of jobs lost with the increased population, we should theoretically have had an unemployment increase of 564,000. That is almost double what it was a year ago. In other words, it should have almost doubled to 1.1 million. That is the real unemployment level today.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, we have had jobs wiped out and we have had an increase in the population. If the figures were fair dinkum we would have 1.1 million people out of work. Instead, most of these people have disappeared out of the statistics. The unemployment level rose by only 232,000 instead of 564,000. Where have the other 330,000 people disappeared to? They are not in the statistics. They are out of the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Something like 5.1 million Australians are not registered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as being in the work force. According to the Bureau of Statistics, almost 40 per cent of Australians are not in the work force. In other words, people have been discouraged, people have given up or people are not being counted as unemployed because of some very curious statistical requirements, which I think Senator Walters referred to earlier today.
       </para>
       <para>
        For young Australians it is the same situation. For young Australians, wiping out 129,200 full time jobs over the past 12 months means that, after taking into account the fact that there are 37,700 fewer 15-to 19-year-olds in the population, teenage unemployment should have risen by about 91,500 in that time. Instead of showing that, the official figures show that the full time unemployment figure was up by only about 19,000. What happened to the remaining 72,000 young Australians? Did they just disappear, or did they just disappear out of the statistics?
       </para>
       <para>
        If these 72,000 people who have just disappeared were added back to the unemployment figure, we would get a youth unemployment rate in Australia of 44 per cent. That is the real rate. Of course, the Government has hidden it. It has hidden it in some ways which may bring some benefit to some of these young people. To an extent it has hidden it by now paying Austudy to secondary school students. That means that many of them are going back to school. Those people who are going back to school will, to some extent, receive a benefit in the sense that their options will be increased, but by no means all of them will get that benefit. Many of them are, in effect, going into a school situation which is not bringing them specific benefits, which is not aimed at increasing their qualifications and which is becoming something of a teenager-sitting exercise aimed at reducing the evident level of youth unemployment. There is no disadvantage to young people in going back to school because Austudy is at the same level as the unemployment benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen what has happened. Compared with the situation in, say, 1983 there are now 157,500 young people looking for work, full time or part time. That is about 9,000 fewer than in 1983, but an extra 120,000 are being paid to stay on at school. There is no doubt that the Government's decision has helped to reduce the size of the unemployment queues, but the real rate of youth unemployment now is about 44 per cent. How long will young Australians be forced to carry the burden of the Government's deliberate recession policies?
       </para>
       <para>
        It keeps getting worse. The Government says, and Senator Maguire says, `Things are getting better; look at the lovely sets of figures'. We will believe that there are lovely sets of figures when we see youth unemployment actually falling, when we see total unemployment actually falling, when we see this economy actually picking up and moving forward. The way to get that is to have the basic reforms that we have been talking about and which this Government has been rejecting for years. We want basic labour market reform. We want basic tax reform to get rid of the chaos of the ludicrous tax system where an unreasonable burden is carried by the people who pay PAYE tax. That is one of the reasons we want to introduce a goods and services tax which is much fairer than the present hidden and discriminatory sales tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        We want the economy to pick up. Nothing that this Government has done is directed at improving the basic economy of this nation. The Government has no policies other than recession driven policies. It has kicked this economy down. It has engineered the unemployment which at present is a disgrace, at a level which I believe is totally intolerable and must not be allowed to continue.

         —I rise to speak in opposition to the urgency motion moved by Senator Alston. I must say that it has always been less than convincing to hear a conservative politician of any description or any stripe talk about unemployment. That is not only my experience but it is also the experience of generations of people in the Labor movement in this country. People look to a political party to provide some insight into problems that confront the nation. People look to a political party to provide an alternative when it resides in opposition. If we look at the proposition moved by Senator Alston this afternoon, it is immediately clear that the matter of urgency which he has outlined for the Senate's consideration lacks merit of any kind. There is no alternative policy prescription placed before the chamber this afternoon.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Since I have been here, I have noticed that that can be said with equal force about all the urgency motions that arise from those opposite. The Opposition remains devoid of alternative policy prescriptions. As I listened to the debate this afternoon, to Senator Vanstone and to Senator Michael Baume, in particular, I waited for an alternative analysis, for an outline of policy, for a single initiative; aside from the goods and services tax-as my colleague Senator Maguire more accurately describes it, a value added tax-there is not one initiative apparent from those opposite. The sum total of what would be achieved by the passage of this motion by the Senate this afternoon would be precisely nought; the urgency motion means precisely nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The urgency motion before the Senate this afternoon not only lacks a capacity to appreciate an economic circumstance, but also affords no capacity to the chamber to evaluate circumstances. That brings me to the Opposition parties generally. If we are to talk in terms of leadership I think it is fair to look with some degree of evaluation at the Liberal and National parties around the country. Just recently in Western Australia we saw the absolute catastrophe of the Floreat by-election at which I gather, and Senator Maguire may know better, some honourable senators from the Liberal Party in Western Australia had more than a passing hand-a very close and abiding interest in internal Liberal Party politics in that State.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had a circumstance where an official Liberal Party candidate was rejected by the Liberals' own constituency in precisely the same manner in which the press gallery voted with its feet this afternoon when Senator Alston rose to speak. Members of the press gallery did not even need to look at the urgency motion in detail to tell that it meant nought and would achieve nought, to tell at a glance that it was simply ritualistic. I must say that it was with an almost unseemly haste that members of the fourth estate departed the gallery this afternoon. But who can blame them? Having endured enough of these urgency motions, more than a few honourable senators would be wanting to depart in precisely the same way.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen the Liberal Party in utter chaos in the State of Western Australia. In the State of Tasmania we have seen the Opposition Leader, Mr Gray, spend more time before a royal commission than in the Parliament. The State of Victoria gives us a classic example of how the leadership of the Liberal Party is in absolute terminal deterioration. Only two or three months ago we had Mr Kennett re-elected to the Liberal Party leadership in Victoria, in the type of revolving door leadership displays in which the Liberals excel. Mr Brown departed; Mr Kennett re-entered-enter stage right!
       </para>
       <para>
        One of Mr Kennett's first initiatives was to threaten the superannuation of Labor members in the Victorian Parliament. For about 60 minutes this appeared to be a clever idea. It then suddenly occurred to everyone that superannuation, as a hard won right within the Australian industrial work force, could be threatened not only at the parliamentary level but also at any other level by a Liberal government. As my colleague Senator Foreman knows from hard experience in the trade union movement, rights such as superannuation are won after a long struggle. They are not something people want to give up.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Kennett's ploy backfired in the most demonstrable way possible. He was forced to withdraw. In the process of withdrawing, he plummeted a full 20 percentage points in terms of public estimation of his leadership capacity. We now see Mrs Kirner, the Victorian Premier, again heading him as the preferred Premier in that State.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make these points because Senator Alston and other Opposition senators talk of leadership. Senator Baume is fond of talking about New South Wales and what a marvellous administration the Greiner-Murray Government is. `A marvellous administration', we hear from Federal Liberal senators. Of course, the public estimation is entirely different.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a contradiction in terms to talk about a Liberal Party election campaign-they are mutually exclusive terms. By Christmas we will see precisely what this second term of the Greiner-Murray Government is worth. We had a circumstance in which the Liberal and National parties could not lose the State election of 25 May. They kept telling us so. They told the electorate of New South Wales they could not lose. The very day that the Leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, Mr Greiner, announced the State election he was featured in one of the metropolitan newspapers in Sydney eating an ice cream. He had nothing else to do-nothing by way of a campaign. In just the same way as the Liberal Party threw away the Brisbane City Council because it is massively incompetent when it comes to a leadership circumstance, massively incompetent in a circumstance in which people have to make a judgment upon it-the Brisbane City Council is now long gone-we now have a minority government in New South Wales. It is now 49 plus one: the Greiner-Murray-Windsor Government. That is Liberal and National Party leadership.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not need to dwell on the state of the Liberal Party in Queensland. It can be dismissed utterly in the State Parliament and we know the manner in which the Brisbane City Council-the Liberal Party's one remaining political asset in that State-was lost, again in a fiasco of a campaign: smug and self-satisfied.

         —I will take the interjection from Senator Baume because the question has to be asked rhetorically: when will the Opposition decide? The battle lines are clearly being drawn. We will have a circumstance where, if two days after John Kerin delivers the Budget in the House of Representatives Dr Hewson rises and says, `The consumption tax is something to which we are committed', we will fight the general election on it. What those opposite now know is that they cannot win an election on the basis of a consumption tax. That is the beauty of the circumstance. They will not win it. It is not a political argument which they can sustain and win. The battle lines will be drawn two days afterwards, when John Hewson rises in the House of Representatives, because members of the Opposition will not be able to walk away from it. If they stay with a consumption tax between now and the general election, they will not win the argument. It will be interesting to test opinion.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is absolute chaos opposite. What figure will the consumption tax be? Will it be 15 per cent, 12 1/2 per cent or 10 per cent? To whom will it apply? As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made clear in an address to the Federated Ironworkers national conference a couple of weeks ago, every time a family goes to the football, to a cricket match or out for a meal at a fast food outlet; every time a family visits the doctor or the dentist; every time a taxpayer seeks advice from an accountant or has to complete a tax return; every time a family goes to the movies or the theatre, or parents take their kids to the circus-every time families are involved in any of the routine pursuits by which Australians pursue a reasonable, open standard of living, by which they pursue a certain degree of happiness-the tax man and woman will be present.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a circumstance in which, as Senator Maguire said earlier, we will have a Taxation Office led recovery. But a few things have to be said about the GST. I suddenly notice, Madam Acting Deputy President, the supreme reign of silence opposite when the GST is mentioned-the utter reign of silence, even from Senator Baume, and to render Senator Baume silent is no mean accomplishment.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a tax which is peculiarly regressive. There is a circumstance that confronts us now by which, when the battle lines are drawn, we will have a regressive tax as the centrepiece, the core, of Opposition economic policy. That is what the general election of 1993 will be fought upon because the Opposition will be committed to a regressive and inflationary tax. What will happen when that inflationary tax applies? It will apply with the greatest force to those who can least afford to pay. Obviously, that is of no concern to the Liberal and National parties. It never has been. The living standards of working people have never featured in anything those parties have ever said or done in any of their platforms or in any of their political commitments. We will have a circumstance in which a 15 per cent GST-presuming that is what the Liberal and National parties commit themselves to; we do not know because they are not saying-will apply with greatest force upon people who can least afford to pay it in all those everyday situations that I have outlined.
       </para>
       <para>
        A few days ago we had Dr Hewson in New Zealand telling us that the Bolger Government was showing the way to go. That was a first class opportunity for anyone who wanted to look at present New Zealand economic and political circumstances and to draw the appropriate conclusions. It will be done. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has committed himself to applause on the Bolger Government. Senator Maguire nods in agreement because he understands at a stroke what utter chaos has occurred in New Zealand under the Bolger Government: the cutting of massive holes in the social security net; the explosion in unemployment; the massive protest marches; and the enormous disaffection that the Bolger Government's Budget has caused even in the ranks of Mr Bolger's own party.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the formula Dr Hewson wants to translate to an Australian political context. He has said so. We do not need to dwell on the Canadian experience with the GST; we have the New Zealand experience right before us, just across the Tasman. That will be instructive as we move again to a general election. So the focus after this Budget will be on Dr Hewson's reply. We will see how brave, committed and buoyant those opposite are when they go to the Australian people committed to the most regressive and inflationary form of taxation imaginable. That will be a fight for us, worth fighting and worth winning.

         In speaking to this Report to the Minister for Transport and Communications entitled Film and Television Co-Productions, I would like to address my remarks not so much to the matter of communications policy but rather to trade and industry policy. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would have to be one of the most ideological arms of government. Mr Peter Westerway has been the general secretary of the New South Wales branch of the ALP, the party's campaign director in that State, the chairman of the economics and trade committee of the ALP Federal Executive and Treasurer of the Federal Executive. This is the man to whom the Government is entrusting the enforcement of the proposed ban on electronic political broadcasting.
        </para>
        <para>
         The ABT wallows in philosophical squalor. One could even say that broadcasting in this country is somehow incapable of standing on its own two feet and should be propped up with industry protection in the form of local content requirement and the various ownership laws which seem to be a perpetual and movable feast. But this is no different from the impact of trade protection that we have in other areas of industry. Take the Australian music quota on radio, for instance. The quota has led to the most absurd outcomes.
        </para>
        <para>
         I am aware of an ethnic public radio station in Adelaide which broadcasts in 48 different languages but found that it was playing Waltzing Matilda during Turkish programs just to meet the quota. In Sydney, an easy listening station has been forced to make its own substandard records because there was insufficient new Australian music available in the format in which it, particularly, broadcasts. Stations also face competition with the ABC whose stations are totally immune to the Tribunal's requirements-quite relevant when it comes to the ratings.
        </para>
        <para>
         This report, which adds precious little to the debate on the opening up of broadcasting to international competition, is now before us. I have an immediate interest in a section of the report relating to the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations agreement. The Tribunal rejected a joint submission from two New Zealand independent television production companies complaining of the Tribunal's television program standard No. 14 entitled `Australian content of television programs'. The Tribunal concluded that the only barrier to New Zealand competition lies in limits on foreign ownership as set out in the Broadcasting Act. The report states:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . it should be noted that New Zealand productions are currently allowed free access to the Australian broadcast media.
        </para>
        <para>
         I find this to be an extraordinary statement.
        </para>
        <para>
         The coalition now offers a genuine alternative in this area. Last week, my colleague the shadow Minister for trade negotiations, Mr Alexander Downer, released the Opposition's policy on closer economic relations with New Zealand. That policy committed the coalition to removing local content regulations for television and broadcasting as far as New Zealand is concerned and, most importantly, to allowing New Zealand interests to invest on the same terms as Australian interests in television and broadcasting in this country.
        </para>
        <para>
         If we are serious about seeing that closer economic relations mean that we will allow a single market to operate between Australia and New Zealand so that we take the benefits of an enlarged population base, then surely the area of telecommunications is one of the most important that must be opened up. There is no problem in Australia's being able to put programs to air in New Zealand, and yet we seem to be full of fear that New Zealand may be able to put something into Australian television which somehow would not fit with the way that we consider broadcasts should be made. In looking at this report, I would say that one could describe it with one word-disappointing.

         I rise to speak on Report No. 11 of the Industry Commission to indicate yet again the totally unsatisfactory nature of the way in which the Industry Commission is now operating. Honourable senators will recall that when we dealt with the legislation for the creation of this Industry Commission, amendments were successfully moved by the Australian Democrats-and accepted by the Government-that the Industry Commission would take as a constant reference consideration of the environmental consequences of whatever it was that was before it at the time. No industry affects the environment in this country more than the electricity generating industry. The Industry Commission has again failed to address properly the environmental impact of electricity generation.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is about time that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, as the Minister responsible, began to properly discharge his duty in directing the Industry Commission to carry out its function properly under its Act and so far Senator Button has failed to do that. I indicated that the last time I spoke on one of these reports-the IC report on the motor vehicle industry in this country. As I recall it, in that report of some 250 pages, about three-quarters of a page was devoted to the environmental impact of the motor vehicle industry. That is again a totally unsatisfactory doffing of the Commission's hat to its responsibility to address the environmental question.
        </para>
        <para>
         The IC has one commissioner appointed to its commissioners and it has totally inadequate staff to properly discharge its function in relation to considering environmental matters. Again, I point to the Minister responsible, Senator Button, who is not properly discharging his responsibility as the Minister and not seeing that the IC is properly discharging its responsibility under its Act.
        </para>
        <para>
         We only have a few brief moments to look at the summary and recommendations of this report before us. The summary and recommendations, which are in volume I of the report, cover 28 pages of which less than a page deals with the environmental consequences. For instance, we find on page 13, in the section dealing with load management energy conservation-which is the only part of the summary dealing with these matters-these words:
        </para>
        <para>
         Corporatised utilities should not be required to pursue energy conservation initiatives that are contrary to their commercial interests.
        </para>
        <para>
         There one sees clearly the distortion by the IC of its responsibility, in that it is taking the commercial interests of the electricity generating authorities and subsuming their environmental and conservation responsibilities to those commercial interests. In other words, if they can sell more electricity and make more money by selling more electricity, then irrespective of the consequences in terms of resource usage, irrespective of the consequences in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and irrespective of the consequences in terms of other pollution and social environmental consequences, that is the course that they should follow, according to the Industry Commission.
        </para>
        <para>
         Further on in the same section dealing with conservation the report mentions a number of conservation measures that might be taken, and then goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para>
         These latter measures severely curtail consumer choice. It is not clear whether such actions are warranted. It needs to be established that these programs can provide net benefits to society, taking into account both direct and indirect costs.
        </para>
        <para>
         That entirely leaves out considerations of the environmental consequences, which the Industry Commission, under its Act, is charged to investigate and to report upon.
        </para>
        <para>
         The final summary has six schedules dealing with these matters in detail, and then only three brief points at the end, the first one of which is to `remove government requirements that electricity and gas utilities pursue noncommercial demand side management activities'-in other words, the precise things that the electricity authorities should be required to do in a properly managed industry.

         I take note of a few points in this report. The electricity and gas supply industries are among Australia's biggest, and their combined annual output was in the order of about $7 billion, or about 2.5 per cent of GDP. They are very big industries. Both industries are capital intensive in their production facilities and they require large expanding transmission and distribution networks, and the lives of major assets range from about 30 to 60 years in Australia at the moment. The industries supply vital inputs to a wide range of Australian industries. The electricity and gas supply industries have not been performing to their full potential. Participants in the inquiry acknowledge significant shortcomings in performance. That is, of course, where the coalition stands as far as this report is concerned.
        </para>
        <para>
         We believe that the report is a good report. It makes some very good points about sharing electricity around Australia; about energy interchange on both an opportunity and contract basis; and about incentives to increase efficiency through increased competition and greater planning flexibility. That is what the coalition believes that we need when establishing an Australian electricity grid-which we call Auselgrid-because at the moment essentially all our electricity is generated on stand-alone State systems with limited interconnection. If we can get them all interconnected, if we can get them all working together, we will actually save a lot of power generation needs and we will make the whole of the generation distribution network in Australia much more cost effective. We believe that that is something that has to come. This report goes towards solving the problems with the power industries in Australia, and I commend it to the Senate.

          —The Senate is considering the Industry Commission's Report No. 11 on electricity generation and distribution. In a period of recession the most welcome news in this report is that there is easily realisable scope for improving efficiency in energy generation in Australia and that the potential gains are large-in the order of $2.4 billion a year. The report covers electricity and gas supplies, but today I will speak only on electricity.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The report notes that in the 1980s poor investment decisions led to excess capacity and gross overstaffing in the industry. In most overseas countries it is usual to have a 20 to 25 per cent reserve margin, whereas Australia, since the 1980s, has had a 40 to 70 per cent reserve plant margin, more than double the general requirement overseas. This was largely because one morning Neville Wran had to have a cold shower when the whole system in New South Wales failed. The resulting construction activity led to the present situation of too much generating capacity.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Industry Commission has estimated that, if the electricity supply industry's performance was up to best international practice, national output could expand by $2.2 billion annually. In other words, $2.2 billion is the annual cost to the nation of the centralised planning system which has been imposed on this industry. Reform to the industry could increase household disposable income by $300 per year. As a result of this, the Industry Commission has estimated, up to 8,000 new jobs could be created.
        </para>
        <para>
         How do we achieve these benefits? The Industry Commission urgently recommends action to increase competition by restructuring the electricity supply industry, and sets out very clearly in the report, step by step, how this can be done. First, ring fence or separate generation, transmission and distribution assets in all States. For transmission, the Commission advocates the establishment of a national grid for New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. By separating transmission-which, because of the costs involved, is recognised as being a natural monopoly-it is possible to stimulate private sector interest in new generating capacity. To achieve this, the Commission proposes that existing government owned generating capacity be split into a number of independent generating units that would compete against each other, as well as against new private generators.
        </para>
        <para>
         This report is well timed. Only two weeks ago the communique from the special Premiers Conference supported the establishment of the proposed National Grid Management Council to encourage open access to the eastern and southern Australian grid and free trade in bulk electricity for private and public electricity customers. Government representatives agreed that the interconnectives between New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT were feasible and justified. The New South Wales restructuring, which is already under way, is very much in line with the findings of this report. Elcom's generating plant in New South Wales will be split into regional units and they will compete to supply the grid.
        </para>
        <para>
         New South Wales is in a superior position to sell power to other States, because it has the cleanest and most efficient coal and its Electricity Commission has already been restructured to maximise efficiency. This is expected to lead to a 5 per cent reduction in bills in the next two years.
        </para>
        <para>
         In the Hunter Valley, where I reside, the proposed changes will have an enormous benefit. The Hunter produces 80 per cent of New South Wales electricity and 24 per cent of the nation's supply. The region is now able to compete with other States to supply electricity to the whole of eastern Australia, and with the recent completion of a number of new power stations will, because of its excess capacity, be able to supply other areas in the economy. I mention Victoria, in particular. I recommend this report to the Senate and urge support for its recommendations for a more competitive and efficient power industry by implementing the findings as quickly as possible.

          —I wish to mention briefly a few matters that are relevant to energy generation within Australia. In doing so, I note that the introductory paragraph of the summary and recommendations shows that electricity and gas supply industries are amongst Australia's biggest. In the 1986-87 year, their combined annual output was in the order of $7 billion. That figure sticks in my mind.

        <para>
         I note that it is the same amount that the Australian Democrats want to collect in additional taxes in their alternative budget, which was apparently released on the weekend. I suppose that the figure of $7 billion shows just what big industries the electricity and gas supply industries are when we compare that figure with the amount that the Democrats want to collect in additional taxes from Australians at this particular time.

        <para>
         As I mentioned, I want to speak briefly about three aspects of electricity and energy generation. One has been mentioned by Senator Brownhill; that is, uranium as a fuel. That seems to me to be a direction in which Australia must go in getting fuel which is clean, cheap and for which Australia has plenty of reserves and resources. It seems to me absolutely ridiculous that the Government should continue with its three-mine policy when there is this good resource of uranium available for electricity and energy generation. It amazes me that neither the Government nor the Democrats bother to pursue that very efficient use of fuel.
        </para>
        <para>
         The other matter I want to mention briefly is the Tully Millstream hydro-electricity project, which is proposed in the area from where I hail. That project has won resounding support from many areas. All of the local authorities in the area support the scheme absolutely, as do the Queensland State Labor Government and most politicians of all parties in the north Queensland area. Most of them realise that at the moment north Queensland is very much at risk in the area of power generation and power supplies when cyclones and other natural calamities come our way. We need an additional source of energy.

It is needed as we approach the turn of the century, and that extra generation must be provided. It is also needed in that in times of natural calamity north Queensland, in particular, needs a guaranteed source of supply.

          —Can Senator Kernot produce some figures that show that solar power is feasible? If she can, she is doing things that scientists and experts cannot do. But that is typical of the Democrats attitude to life. They tend to live in fairyland and think that if they wish these things would happen, therefore, they will happen. There has been quite a deal of research into solar power by the Queensland Electricity Commission, and it has proved to be inappropriate at present. Again, Tully Millstream will provide hydro-electric energy, which is the cleanest fuel that we can get. Why a party that prides itself on opposing fossil fuels and the greenhouse effect is opposed to something that will provide such clean and efficient energy is entirely beyond me.

         In Slovakia there are two atomic power stations and, in Hungary, there are four. The communities living in the shadow of those power stations are making every conceivable possible effort to be able to decommission them, to look for alternative sources of energy. They are living in the shadow of Chernobyl. I recommend that Senator Macdonald should travel to Chernobyl and perhaps even acquire a holiday home near Chernobyl so that he can experience first-hand the problems of living in the shadow of nuclear power.

         In Austria two atomic power stations were almost complete when a referendum was held and the people of Austria had the good sense and foresight to vote against them. The Government is now, in response to a referendum, decommissioning those two nuclear power stations. I believe that we should learn from the experiences overseas. I do not think we should make the same mistakes again, and we should stop this babble about nuclear energy when the whole world is turning away from it.

         I want to say a few words about the Australian Federal Police. Three emblems appear on the outside of the National Common Police Services Annual Report: those of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the Australian Police Staff College and the National Police Research Unit, all of which have close relationships with the Australian Federal Police. Their emblems appear on the cover of this pamphlet.

         There has been a great turnabout in the Australian Federal Police. It is a most efficient organisation and a very happy one. That change has taken place since 1987. Three people deserve special mention for bringing about that situation. First, there is Mr McAulay, the Commissioner. Secondly, there is Mr Chris Eaton, who was Secretary of the Australian Federal Police Association, the union of the Federal Police. He retired from that position earlier this year, but was a most excellent Secretary of that Association. The third person is the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate. On an occasion like this, I think it is proper to pay tribute to those three men.
        </para>
        <para>
         While Senator Tate has been Minister, while Mr McAulay has been Commissioner and while Chris Eaton has been Secretary, there has been a restructuring of the Australian Federal Police force. That has been most successfully and most happily carried out. Indeed, the fame of the force has now travelled to the extent where a Deputy Commissioner, Mr John Johnson, has been appointed the Commissioner of the Tasmanian police force. This is an occasion where tribute can be paid to him, too, a person whom I have met and who has recently taken up his position. I take this opportunity to wish him and his wife, Pat, the very best now that they have gone down to Tasmania, a great State which has been the birthplace of some very great people.

           —Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 13 February 1991, I lay on the table a report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration entitled List of Commonwealth Bodies which was presented to the Acting Deputy President, Senator Burns, on 27 June 1991. In accordance with the terms of the resolution, the Acting Deputy President has authorised the printing and circulation of the report.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, as you said, the report List of Commonwealth Bodies, which has now been tabled, was presented early in the winter recess and was released publicly around that time. I would like to comment briefly on its scope and purpose. The list aims to record all Commonwealth bodies and to provide basic information about their structure. It is the most comprehensive listing of bodies in the Commonwealth public sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         The list shows that there are now 506 statutory authorities and offices and 450 non-statutory bodies in the Commonwealth administration. The Committee has also identified 494 companies and incorporated associations which are either owned by the Australian Government or in which the Government has a substantial interest.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Committee has been concerned for many years that government agencies outside the mainstream Public Service departments may escape parliamentary accountability. The absence of a consolidated list of bodies kept up-to-date by the Government is an important gap in the accountability system. The Committee has recommended several times in the past that the Government itself should maintain an up-to-date list of government bodies. Successive governments have rejected that recommendation and the Committee has been forced to maintain its own list.
        </para>
        <para>
         This report, the latest of 15 produced by the Committee since 1979 listing Commonwealth bodies of various types, is derived from a new computer database developed by the Committee. The Committee proposes to keep the database up to date and to extend its coverage progressively. Although it is the most comprehensive list so far produced, there are still the inevitable gaps and the usual problems which result when information becomes dated. One gap which the Committee proposes to examine in more detail over the next few months is the extent of Commonwealth involvement in unincorporated joint ventures and partnerships, unit trusts and funds, and holdings of preference shares in some companies.
        </para>
        <para>
         It will be obvious from the size of the document that development and maintenance of the database and production of the report were substantial tasks. I place on record the Committee's thanks to those of its staff who worked on this project, particularly Chris James, who was seconded from the Department of Finance and who developed the database, and Michael Game and Mick McLean who collected and checked the data. I seek leave to continue my remarks on another occasion.

         —I rise to speak on the referral of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 to a select committee. This Bill is the product of a discredited government and a discredited Minister. Certainly the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) must carry the odium of his handling of this outrageous Bill. But it must not be forgotten that it was endorsed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Cabinet. If my memory is correct, at the time this Bill was introduced the Prime Minister was quoted in the media as saying, in reference to Dr Hewson, `Let's teach this kid a lesson'. Those words have come back to haunt this Government, this Minister and this Prime Minister.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        From all the public statements on this atrocious Bill, it is interesting to note that there are only three people whom I know of who have supported it: Mr Bob Hogg, the Federal Secretary of the ALP; the ACTU itself; and Phillip Adams. What a wonderful list of people to support this Bill!
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill was first mooted by Bob Hogg in 1990. Following this rumour, I asked the Minister whether he was planning legislation. I also asked him, `Since when were non-elected party apparatchiks telling the Government what to do?'. The Minister, in replying, took high umbrage and said unequivocally that he was not planning this type of legislation. As subsequent events have shown, the Minister has an understanding and respect for the truth only matched by that of his own Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question must be raised: why is this Bill so obnoxious? The Bill has some 26 clauses, of which 22 or 23 relate to a ban on advertising. The remaining clauses deal with disclosure. In its present form, the Bill covers all levels of government: Federal, State and local. It bans for 365 days of the year, year in year out, any advertisements on radio or television which criticise a present government, a past government, a present Opposition, a past Opposition, a member of parliament, and even a political party. It is a blanket ban Bill. The Bill makes it quite clear that this ban would apply to paid and unpaid advertising. This caused enormous concern within the community as a whole because it raised a lot of definitional problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        When introducing this Bill, the Minister made a number of public statements-and he made them more than once. He said that the Bill would go through because he had the support of the Australian Democrats. This caused concern and suspicion on our side of the chamber that a deal had been made. Subsequent discussions with the Democrats on this issue did not make us feel any easier about the probability of a deal. The Bill was rushed through the House of Representatives. It was gagged; it was guillotined after a couple of hours of debate.

         —Senator McLean says that they all are. Give him half a chance and he would do the same here, too, I suppose. The Bill was then introduced into the Senate. Our concern was such that we moved a motion two days before the Parliament rose to refer the whole Bill to a committee. Understandably, the Government opposed that motion. It did not want the Bill referred to a committee because it did not want the public at large to know what was in it. To its disgrace, it did not want the Bill to be publicly exposed during committee hearings. Only the Democrats can answer why they gave the Government the numbers to prevent the Bill from going to a committee.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Opposition has been totally consistent throughout this whole debate. We have not moved an inch. We have taken the view that under no circumstances could freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, be at all compromised. There was no room for discussion or negotiation. One either believes in freedom of expression or one does not. The Minister talked about there being no such thing as free speech. He is quite right. Even when one picks up the telephone, it is not free speech. But there is something called freedom of speech.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only option open to us was to engage in our own committee hearings on this matter during the winter recess. This committee was ably chaired by my colleague Senator Olsen. I could not but notice the remarks made by the Minister on the program Ring the Bells last Saturday. He referred to the people who gave evidence to that committee as hired guns. Is he saying that the Salvation Army is a hired gun? Is he saying that all the other people who gave evidence in good faith were hired guns?
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time we ran a forum in Brisbane with leading legal people-the deans of law at the University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology, the professors of journalism from both universities and Mr Chris Griffith of the watchdog committee. Every one of those people expressed concern at the contents of this outrageous Bill. How did the Minister refer to the people who questioned the legalities of this Bill? His implication, again on the Ring the Bells program, was that those lawyers must have got their degrees from a cornflakes packet. I am sure that would go over well not only with the people I mentioned but also with Professor Zines, Professor Alston and Professor David Flint from the Press Council. I could go on and on. I am sure my colleagues will cover most of those aspects.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned that we are totally consistent in our absolute opposition to this outrageous and draconian piece of legislation. The Minister attempted to divert the issue to one of disclosure. Our parties, the Liberal and National parties, both took a decision to support full-blooded disclosure. We took the decision to support disclosure, provided there was protection in the legislation against intimidation and provided the legislation was fair and equitable in regard to the treatment of donors to all political parties. This was thrown up as being some sort of effort to get around the legislation because we really did not want it. That has been sunk once and for all. After the committee hearing we decided that we would again refer this Bill to a Senate committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week, because he could see the thing going out backwards, the Minister did a back-flip. He said, `We will compress the time. We won't have the ban for 365 days of the year; we will just have the ban during election time'. How he thought he would convince the Democrats of that furphy is beyond me. I know they are easily convinced, but not that easily convinced. The Minister was proposing something that some months ago he himself said was totally unworkable. Of course it is unworkable. The government of the day knows when an election will be held. The proposal means that the government can run up to the date the election is announced and then, from that date, there will be a blanket ban-a blackout-but all the other rules and regulations will remain intact. At no stage during an election campaign could anyone run a radio or television advertisement criticising a past or present government or commenting about a political party or a candidate. Nor could there be a paid or an unpaid advertisement.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not my intent to keep this chamber longer than I need to, but I will comment briefly on some of the remarks made by Senator Bolkus when speaking about the reference of the Bill to a committee. I notice that his own Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, who is in the other place, wrote to a constituent and said that all the Government was doing was following the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report Who pays the piper calls the tune. Whether intentional or not, that was a gross untruth. Senator Bolkus himself referred to Who pays the piper calls the tune. It is worth commenting again on that report. It was a unanimous report, I think, which said quite categorically that, whilst some viewers may support a complete ban on political advertising, such a ban would have a direct effect on freedom of speech by reducing opportunities for discussion during election periods. The Minister's fall-back position was to do exactly what the Committee said he should not do.
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking to this reference, Senator Bolkus dredged up some nefarious plan which he said the Liberal Party was engaging in to avoid disclosure. As I mentioned earlier, his looseness with the truth is matched only by that of his discredited Prime Minister. There is no basis for what Senator Bolkus said, no matter what his mate Mr Hogg might be saying or what stories Mr Hogg might be making up. He has exposed the hypocrisy of himself, his Government and the Labor Party through Mr Hogg. He is running furphies about the Liberal Party setting up some sort of trust, which is absolutely untrue, yet across my desk has come a letter of appeal from Gary Gray, Assistant National Secretary, Director of Fundraising, National Secretariat, Australian Labor Party. Across the top it is marked `Personal and Confidential'. Let us hear what this letter has to say. Mr Gray is making a plea for funds, and he says:

       <para>
        But that is only the lead-in. He also says:

       <para>

       <para>
        Then he goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        While political contributions which are used for electoral purposes must be disclosed, it is accepted that administrative or non-electoral contributions are currently not disclosable under the Federal Electoral Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        What hypocrites! What blatant hypocrites! Having said that people could contribute to the administration fund or the building appeal, and that these did not qualify for disclosure, he goes on further:

       <para>

        This has put the National Secretariat at the centre of our centenary celebrations.

I must pay tribute again to my colleague Senator Alston for the work he did and also to the people in Tasmania who let it be known what happened. We hear about promotion and that sort of thing. The Minister did not get where he is on merit; he got there simply because it was his turn as leader of the Socialist Left faction-and it shows. In fact, there is nothing that this Minister has touched which has not backfired. We do not have to look too far behind the ad ban. We all remember the improper intervention in the computer consumables contract.
       </para>
       <para>
        We support the reference of this matter to a committee. In fact, today I moved a motion to refer it to a committee. I had been told, or I had heard on the radio or somewhere, that the Minister was going to do it but, because of past experience with this man, I did not trust him. As a safeguard, this morning I moved a motion to refer the Bill to a committee, which would have been given priority tomorrow. When this goes through, of course, I can withdraw it. But that is the feeling in the community. I am only reflecting it. We cannot trust this Minister; we cannot trust this Government; and, quite clearly, we cannot trust the Prime Minister. They are all in the same boat together. As I indicated, we will be supporting the reference of this Bill to a committee.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, make no mistake, Senator Bolkus's backdown last night on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill was not the voice of reason at long last that he would like the public and the media to believe, but the pained cries of a defeated man and a cornered Government-a defeated Minister with the weight of public opinion against legislation that he had introduced into this Parliament.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        From its conception, this Bill has been one of the most insidious pieces of legislation that this Parliament has been confronted with. It was put forward by a Government that is so on the boardroom and public nose and so in debt that it sought to ban electronic advertising because it could not afford it and was frightened it was going to be at a significant disadvantage in the next election campaign. That is why this legislation is on the table for us to consider. It is also because of Western Australia Inc. The Minister keeps talking about brown paper bags. A lot more can be put in a black briefcase than in a brown paper bag, but the Minister conveniently forgets that. The disclosure component is before this Parliament now because the Government thought it had to act publicly to dissipate the odium that was flowing into the Labor Party ranks as a result of Western Australia Inc.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are the two specific reasons why this legislation is before the Parliament. It wrapped the ad ban Bill in with the political funding component of the legislation. There is no doubt that that is an arrogant, misplaced attempt to paint the coalition as opposing disclosure if it sought to oppose the ad ban. That was the object of the exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, the Government did not research the proposal or draft it with even a degree of intelligence. The end result was a Bill which the top legal brains in this country said could not be defined. I refer to the Law Council of Australia and to a number of QC opinions which have been put on the public record over the last few weeks. It was a Bill which the Law Council said publicly had a definition of advertising as wide as one wanted it to be; a Bill which Professor David Flint of the Press Council said was so badly drafted that a plethora of other areas such as news, talkback and satire could be banned.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we want affirmation of that, we can look at the 20 clauses of amendments put on the table by the Minister today. If there is any example of badly drafted legislation contained in the Bill, the Minister himself confirms it with the amendments tabled and the five-page explanatory memorandum. That clearly indicates that the legislation introduced by the Minister initially was badly drafted. This was a Bill which, in turn, using the corporations power, could be extended to embrace the print media relatively simply. The Government put before this Parliament a Bill which contravened the human rights agreement that Australia had signed. It was in breach of that. It was a Bill which contravened its own equal opportunity legislation. One million functionally illiterate Australians who rely on the electronic media for news and information were going to be denied access to it, and therefore one million Australians were going to be discriminated against by legislation introduced by this Government. The legislation not only contravened our international obligations but also the Government's own equal opportunity legislation before this Parliament. That is how ill-thought through the proposals were.
       </para>
       <para>
        At every step it forgot what no government should ever forget-that government is there for the community, not itself or a political party. That is the basis behind the draft of the legislation that was introduced earlier this year. We have seen the people speak up and hit back. The Minister says, `Well, it didn't ignite public opinion'. If it did not ignite public opinion, why has the Minister taken two big steps back in the last week? Why has he responded to the public opinion that has been expressed by quite significant organisations and by well-thought of individuals of high standing who have credibility in the Australian community?
       </para>
       <para>
        It was the coalition which provided the forum two weeks ago for the voice of the public to be heard by holding a public inquiry in both Sydney and Melbourne. The Australian Democrats refused to create that opportunity of community consultative process for people to express a view on this legislation. One might say, `Why was it only the coalition which had a committee of inquiry taking evidence?'. It was because Senator Powell, who calls herself a Democrat, had donned the mantle of a political Judas, betraying everything her Party stood for, by refusing to allow this to go to a Senate committee during the winter recess. Senator Powell sided with the Government and refused to agree to that public inquiry. She even issued a press release on 20 June against a Senate committee inquiry, which stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        To waste time, energy and money in a futile attempt to turn back the clock by going over all the ground which has already been covered in debate after debate could achieve no sensible or useful purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was said in a press release from Senator Powell on 20 June. There was a press release from Senator Powell yesterday saying, `We now agree for this to go off to a Senate committee for further report and investigation'. Senator Powell exercised the duplicity and the audacity to write to Senator Parer at the end of last week and say, `We, the Democrats, now want to send it off to a committee. We want you, the Opposition, to support us'. What hypocrisy and audacity on the part of Senator Powell! She and the Democrats had opportunity after opportunity in the Senate, prior to its rising at the end of June, to have this matter referred to a Senate committee of inquiry during the winter recess. Where was Senator Powell then? She was siding with Minister Bolkus. Why was Minister Bolkus hanging in? It was because he knew he had Senator Powell in the hip-pocket and they were going to proceed. It was not until the leadership issue surfaced with Senator Powell that we saw this backtrack to a sensible position, where we ought to have been months ago, suggesting that a Senate tri-party committee ought to be looking at this legislation and reporting back to parliament in due course.
       </para>
       <para>
        The action that we have had from the Democrats really refutes and rebuts everything they are supposed to stand for. They were not prepared to support the democratic process. The inquiry that we eventually ran certainly served a sensible and useful purpose. Useful, because those who were opposed to this legislation gave evidence at that inquiry-and it came from every quarter-which clearly led to last night's backdown and retreat by the Government. Sensible, because it was the only way that the public could have a forum to express a point of view-a forum denied the community by the Democrats, time and time again. They have got `democrat' in their name but they were not prepared to let the democratic process flow through for the community groups to express a point of view on this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Powell has let down not just those who voted for her Party but all Australians because they have to deal with a political framework which gives the Democrats the balance of power, currently, in this chamber. It was Henry Adams who said many years ago that a friend in power is a friend lost. I wonder how many Democrats feel that way today about a leader who is no longer a friend to the democratic cause, based on her actions in leading her Party in this chamber over the course of recent months. The Democrats have much to be ashamed of in this debate. They, their leader, or whoever, ignored consistently-as did Senator Bolkus-well researched submissions against the Bill, such as the evidence that was put before that coalition committee of inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Human Rights Commissioner did not appear before that inquiry but he did publicly release correspondence he had had with Senator Powell. Having read that, it would seem to indicate to me one of the reasons why Senator Powell did not want that inquiry during the winter recess-because that evidence would have been released at that time. That evidence clearly said that Senator Powell's proposals for a two-minute talking head still breached our international obligations. Therefore, it was not an option and did not absolve the Democrats or the Government for introducing the two-minute talking head in the legislation via amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Human Rights Commissioner expressed a point of view in relation to truth in advertising. Perhaps it is because Senator Powell did not want to have the amendments she had put forward publicly put down and argued against in such a forceful way by the Human Rights Commissioner on the public record. Perhaps that is the reason why--

I might add that it was not her initiative but that of the coalition that sought the FOI application and subsequently got it released publicly. That clearly identifies what we ought to be doing with Senator Powell's amendments to this legislation; they ought to be sent to the same waste paper basket as this legislation.

        What did the Australian Medical Association say? It said it had concerns that the ban would lead to violence as extreme groups, denied access to electronic advertising, forced protests to extremes to gain media news time. In response to the Minister's claim that `you can get on the news bulletins', everyone of us in this chamber would well understand that if we have to rely on the news bulletins and newsrooms to get our messages across, then we will have to rely on the subjective judgment of people in those newsrooms who cut the tape, cut the story and put to air what they think is an appropriate version of what we are saying--

        What did the Media Council have to say? It said that the wide ranging ramifications of this Bill were just too mind boggling to comprehend-the implications of the legislation as it would affect rural Australia. Sixty-seven per cent of rural Australia depends on the electronic news services for news and information and, in terms of public meetings, relies on advertising on commercial stations to get a message across. That includes the ABC, I might add, in terms of a public meeting. What if someone in a small country town which does not have a local newspaper relied on the local news bulletin to advertise a meeting to debate the wool issue? It could not be put to air because it is a political issue and could not be advertised. How do those people get on in rural Australia, given that set of circumstances?

        The Press Council went so far as to say that the legislation was unconstitutional with `horrific, wide ranging ramifications'.

We all would have noted the release on the 7.30 Report last night which was made at about five to eight so that it missed all the electronic news services. It was made so late that it compacted the print media, so that the story would become smaller because it was such a back-down.

        Introduction
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Parliament moved from the old Parliament House to this Parliament House in 1988, the then Presiding Officers had already looked at the most efficient and effective way of providing a range of services to the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        President McClelland and Speaker Jenkins took the decision in the old House to amalgamate the security and attendant groups to achieve staff savings. Speaker Child and I decided to contract out the cleaning service in this Parliament House because of the efficiencies and savings available.
       </para>
       <para>
        Speaker Child and I considered contracting out the Parliamentary Catering Service at the same time but with all the other changes necessitated by this building and the move to contract cleaning it was decided to maintain an in-house catering service in the new Parliament House.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why Did We Contract Out?
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker and I have a responsibility to ensure that catering services are provided in the most cost efficient and effective way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has led the way in seeking efficiencies in its catering operations as a number of years ago it divested itself of the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services and recently adopted the recommendations of the Wrigley report which recommended the contracting out of catering services to the Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most major companies in Australia have long ago moved from carrying out in-house catering and handed it over to professional caterers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Parliamentary Catering Service has always needed a significant subsidy to cover its total net operating costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker and I have been concerned, for some time, about the size of that subsidy and as a consequence had a number of initiatives implemented during the last year which helped reduce the subsidy from around $2.6m in 1989-90 to $2.2m in 1990-91.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact I might mention that the subsidy in 1990-91 could have blown out to $3.4m had we not taken measures which included some staff shedding and reductions in levels of service.
       </para>
       <para>
        Efforts to make the catering service more efficient, including the use of permanent part time workers, have been under discussion with the union for more than three years. It is only in the last 12 months that agreement to a small trial involving 14 staff was achieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Speaker and I were advised that because of the combined impact of the Parliament's sitting pattern, long hours of business, the physical size of Parliament House, major design features of the building and its particular service requirements and the costs involved in running a catering service under public sector employment conditions it would be almost impossible to reduce the net operating subsidy below $2m per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        Aligned against this situation has been the continuing demands by the Government through the Department of Finance for the cost of the subsidy to be substantially reduced. The Department of Finance's aim was to reduce the subsidy level over the next three years to $1m per year.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a survey of members and senators conducted on behalf of the Speaker and me by `Q Consulting' during February this year, 76 per cent of respondents had no objection to the investigation of the option of contracting out all or part of the catering service.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was against this background that the Speaker and I met with the Joint House Committee on 6 June 1991. At that meeting the 10 members of the Committee present, comprising members of the Government and the Opposition parties, after considering a number of options agreed to contract out the Parliamentary Catering Service. I believe that decision was unanimous.
       </para>

        Options for Contracting Out
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Speaker and I discussed with the Joint House Committee the option of bringing in a management fee arrangement where either the staff continued to be employed by the Parliament or the staff were to be employed by a catering contractor.
       </para>
       <para>
        While substantial savings were available under both options, a difficulty was foreseen in having public servants managed by a contractor. Senators may recall Senate Estimates Committee A comments on the problems this had caused in the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the Speaker and I did not want such a situation to arise again.
       </para>
       <para>
        The option of a private contractor employing its own staff but subject to the Speaker and me in consultation with the Joint House Committee setting levels of service and pricing was therefore proceeded with as the preferred option.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind honourable senators of the letter circulated by the Speaker and me on 14 June which brought our decision to the attention of all senators and members. I table a copy of that letter. I might point out that between 14 June and now we have received only five representations from members and senators, of which only two have indicated their opposition to contracting out the catering service.

        However the Joint House Department was advised that in accordance with government policy it was not possible to offer staff their cashed-up superannuation package and a guarantee of employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Union officials and job delegates were given the option of accepting either a package of redundancy benefits and no job guarantee or a lesser package and a guarantee of a job for 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both these options were consistent with the Government's retirement incomes policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The union, while maintaining its opposition to the decision to contract out, indicated that on behalf of its members it rejected the lesser benefits package and the guarantee of a job. The Joint House Department therefore withdrew the jobs guarantee offer and proceeded to deal with staff on the basis that the union had indicated that its members wished to obtain the maximum cash benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of subsequent meetings were held between Joint House officials and union officials and the staff committee.

       <para>
        On 26 July 1991, the union, supported by the ACT Trades and Labour Council, notified a dispute in the Industrial Relations Commission claiming that the Speaker and I, as the nominated employers of parliamentary staff, are subject to the APS redundancy award; that all the negotiation and consultation requirements of the award had not been fulfilled; and that the contract should not be pursued until all the requirements of the award had been fulfilled.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industrial Relations Commission heard the union's arguments and adjourned until 5 August for the Joint House Department to respond to the union's case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The advice provided to Mr Speaker and me was that the APS redundancy award did not apply to us. Nevertheless consultation required by that award had, for all intents and purposes, been met; and the awarding of a contract was not a matter under the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Throughout the whole period, including today, the Joint House Department with the assistance of the majority of its catering staff, has continued to maintain full catering services in Parliament House, except for two major functions.

        As a consequence of our decision, a public tender process managed by the Department of Administrative Services was put in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because it could have been reasonably expected that the Joint House Department consultants, Spotless, would submit a tender proposal, the Speaker and I wrote to the Secretary of the Joint House Department on 14 June stipulating that the tender and selection process was to be consistent with the Commonwealth's tendering arrangements. The Secretary was advised that in letting the contract, the Commonwealth's purchasing authority, the Department of Administrative Services, should work with Joint House Department officers throughout the process. Moreover, a DAS officer was to chair the tender selection panel and the Joint House Department was not to have a majority on the panel. The committee comprised the National Manager, Purchasing Services, Department of Administrative Services as chairperson; a senior consultant from Ernst and Young; and an Assistant Secretary, Joint House Department; and the panel secretary was the Manager, ACT Purchasing Services, Department of Administrative Services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tender process was advertised Australia-wide in mid-June 1991. On 22 June an industry briefing was held for potential tenderers at Parliament House. Representatives of 11 companies attended the briefing.

        After consulting us, the Secretary of the Joint House Department let a contract with Spotless Catering Services Ltd on 31 July 1991. That contract commenced on 12 August 1991.

        The redundancy provisions provided to staff are based on APS provisions: that is, two weeks' pay for each year of service with some additional benefit for long serving staff-for example, staff employed in excess of five years or 10 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, staff have access to pay-outs of their superannuation entitlement multiplied by 2.5 times, recreation leave credits, long service leave credits and one month's pay in lieu of notice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some 147 staff are affected by the change. The 10 clerical staff in the PCS have been redeployed in accordance with the PSU award to comparable clerical positions in the JHD.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of the remaining 137 staff, 118 applied for positions with the contractor. Seventy-two staff have been employed by the contractor including all apprentices, trainees and special placements. The remainder-46-either declined a job, were not offered a job, or did not apply for a job with the contractor. Some of these have retired. Some have secured alternative employment elsewhere. The JHD has assisted all those who requested it in registering with the CES to find jobs elsewhere.

       That the Senate take note of the statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, we appreciate your making this statement-perhaps a little later in the day than we had anticipated; but it certainly puts information before the Senate which we did not have earlier in the day and that should be helpful in the ensuing debate.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are a number of issues involved, but it seems to me that they divide into two major, and in some ways unrelated, subjects. The first concerns the question of your obligation to provide an efficient service in this place-efficient both in the provision of the service and in terms of the cost to the taxpayer. Related to that is the decision which you and Mr Speaker made to change the catering arrangements, whereby they would cease to be in-house and, rather, become provided on a contracting basis. Therefore, the questions involved in that issue concern whether that decision was implemented in a way that was fair and reasonable to the staff that were losing their jobs and other related issues.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think some of my colleagues may wish to speak on that subject. Obviously I have not had a chance to give any considered attention to your statement, but there seems to be a somewhat unusual situation in that certain offers were made which then seem to have been revoked and put in a different form-but no doubt that subject will be addressed.
      </para>
      <para>
       A separate subject concerns your responsibility, Mr President, in our view to ensure the proper functioning of the parliamentary process and to ensure that it is not interrupted and that honourable senators are not hindered by industrial action or any other matters in the performance of their duties. I raised a number of questions with you this morning which had arisen out of things that had come to my attention-such as the fact that mail was not being delivered to honourable senators' offices in accordance with the normal delivery timetable; that other services were not being provided, such as newspapers; and, clearly, the disruption of transport arrangements and the like today.
      </para>
      <para>
       I asked you this morning, Mr President, if you would advise the Senate what action you had taken during this industrial relations dispute to ensure that the parliamentary process, as I have just outlined it, was not disrupted. It does not seem that the statement which you have brought down has addressed that particular question. In fact, you have said in the statement that other services are being maintained. As I interpret it, that means that, in your opinion, all services have been maintained. As I have put to you, Mr President, that does not accord with the information that has been brought to my attention, and perhaps later in this debate you may wish to qualify that particular area.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, the position now is that we still do not know whether disruption as it has occurred today-and as it has occurred on previous days-will in fact be continued tomorrow and on subsequent sitting days.

There has been a suggestion that the cars will park on the other side of the picket line and when the Senate gets up in the middle of the night honourable senators will find their way to the end of the picket and see whether they are able to get transport. I know that this morning those on the other side of the chamber saw this as a laughing matter, but I regard that as an unsatisfactory disruption to the work of honourable senators. I hope that in the course of this debate you might also put to the Senate what the arrangements are in relation to honourable senators' services, such as transport tonight and tomorrow morning.

       I do not want to continue at length now, but I do want to at least refer to this morning's contribution by my friend Senator Cooney who put the position, in his usual, very sincere way, that the course of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission should be allowed to proceed and that we should not be in here criticising the employees and their picket whilst that was taking place. With respect to Senator Cooney, it is the fact that the picket was taking place whilst the arbitration process was in progress which is the subject of our criticism. Now it seems from what you have put to us tonight, Mr President, that in fact the ACT Trades and Labour Council took the matter to the arbitration process. So on the one hand, the TLC took it to arbitration but, on the other hand, it put in place a picket and maintained that picket at least to some extent to the disruption of the parliamentary process.

       We have been told tonight that the decision put down today is that the Presiding Officers' position has been vindicated and that they have acted properly and justly. I presume, therefore, that those who support the arbitration process will now be calling for the picket to be removed; in fact, I hope the picket has been removed because those who stand on the other side and say that the arbitration and conciliation process we have in this country is the perfect answer to resolve industrial disputes will now accept the judge's decision, the arbiter's decision, and the picket would have been removed. I wonder whether the picket has been removed in accordance with the decision brought down in Melbourne today. That will be an interesting test for those who stand by this particular process.

        —Mr President, I do not want to do much more than summarise what I said before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. Having had an opportunity to look at your statement during the dinner break, I have not varied any of my first reactions. However, I want to make it absolutely clear that we on this side of the chamber do not criticise your decision and that of Mr Speaker to privatise the catering functions. We recognise, from what you have put before us tonight, that it has enabled you-in your words-to provide the same service at a saving to the taxpayer of about $1m a year, and that is something that should be acknowledged. Whether you have done it in the best possible way is beyond my state of knowledge to debate.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       You have put to us that there were difficulties in dividing the functions and we take that into account. I would say that one of our initial concerns has been that, as a result of this privatisation, there does not seem to be any greater competition in the provision of catering services within this building, and it is out of competition that efficiencies come. In other words, replacing a public monopoly with a private monopoly does not necessarily and often achieve the benefits that we see in a privatisation process. Nevertheless, you have put it to us that there would have been considerable costs involved in dividing the functions so as to allow for competition. I simply note that.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, it seems to us that you and Mr Speaker could reasonably be subject to some criticism of the way in which the first offer was handled. That seems to be confirmed now that I have looked at your statement in that from page 4 of your statement it seems that there was an offer to all staff of a guarantee of 12 months employment, which is what my colleagues understood the position to be and which they were disturbed about this morning when we found that that was not the case.
      </para>
      <para>
       It seems that the original offer was varied as a result of your learning of government policy that it was not possible to offer staff a cashed-up superannuation package and a guarantee of employment. I can understand that, but it is a pity, if I may say so, that you were not apprised of government policy before the original offer was made. That might have avoided some of the ill feeling that seems to have been engendered in the minds of staff. On the face of this document we can see that there could be some reason for them to be disturbed about the fact that the original offer that was made had to be revoked because it was beyond government policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       It seems to me, on reflection, that you, Mr President, and Mr Speaker should still be subject to some criticism for the disruption to the provision of services to senators that I mentioned earlier today. We on this side of the chamber think that you should now tell us what you will do to ensure that there is no further disruption of those services. We have not heard that from you yet. In particular, we believe that you should tell us what action you have taken to ensure proper transport services tonight.
      </para>
      <para>
       We particularly criticise Minister Bolkus for today supporting industrial action in circumstances in which, we now know, the union had taken the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission. Neither the Government nor the union can have it both ways. It is wrong that the Minister, who is responsible in the first instance for the provision of these administrative functions, can say that he supports industrial action, supports a picket, whilst at the same time the unionists have taken their matter off for arbitration.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now that the Industrial Relations Commission has met and apparently dismissed the union's case in this regard, that criticism will be doubly justified if we find tomorrow that Senator Bolkus maintains his position of earlier today. If that is the case, we will want to pursue it. We trust that no Minister will now endorse continuation of industrial action in the light of the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission. No case can be made for a continuation of disruption through pickets, and, Mr President, we endorse what you say in your statement-that this should be the end of the matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has been a sorry affair, Mr President. There are still a number of unanswered questions to which we would appreciate answers, but we look forward to the future. Now the matter has been resolved by the Commission, we trust that the pickets will be withdrawn and that those providing services will do so in accordance with their normal conditions of contract.

       I support a number of things that Senator Hill said. There is a lack of competition in Parliament House. One instance is especially close to my heart. As one who is reluctant to bank with Westpac, I do not have any alternative but to do so. Sometimes I have been tempted to pose the question as to how that decision was arrived at and whether there is any possibility of expanding competition in the banking area. In reality we are confronted with a series of major monopolies and mini-monopolies. We could cite an even smaller monopoly which we all suffer the consequences of, which shall remain nameless. The phenomenon of monopoly is well established in this place.

       Senator Hill hit the nail on the head when he asked, `Where are we at now?'. When we arrived here this morning, we were greeted with a situation which was clearly unsatisfactory. We need an answer, hopefully, to the question of whether the situation will be any more satisfactory when we walk out the doors tonight to go home than it was when we attempted to get in the doors this morning. With regard to some of the members of our own staff, people are beginning to ask: who are and who are not Commonwealth public servants in this place and what entitlements apply even to those who work for the Department of the Senate?
      </para>
      <para>
       These questions have been put to me as very genuine ones, but there is some degree of confusion which I do not think has been clarified by the ruling of the Industrial Relations Commission today, and in fact the confusion has probably been compounded in some respects. Therefore, we are confronted with a series of genuine questions ranging through those posed most appropriately by Senator Hill as to where we are at now; what we are looking at in the next week or perhaps several weeks; and the circumstances of the people who are employed by the Department of the Senate in terms of entitlements. I would respectfully request that you, Mr President, answer some of those questions for us either tonight or perhaps later.

       Mr President, you will know my long-held view about the Government's lack of outlays with respect to the functioning of the Parliament as distinct from the functioning of the Government. You will know that in particular I have raised questions of concern about the level of funding for the Catering Service. You will know that I have raised concerns about the cutbacks in the Catering Service and have asked for an enhancement of that service. You will also know of my robust defence of those employed by the Parliamentary Catering Service and of my complaints over time concerning the conditions under which they have had to work from time to time.
      </para>
      <para>
       I raise these matters, Mr President, because you will know the genesis of this question of privatisation of the Catering Service. I say with respect that, if the Labor Party members of the Committee persist in their endeavours of misrepresentation and in distancing themselves from the decision of the Presiding Officers, I will happily ask you to make public the deliberations of the Committee when the decision was visited upon that Committee and we were invited to have a point of view. I will do that because then we will see who was sporting the sharp ends of skewers, particularly those members and senators who have affiliations with the union movement, and who embraced a point of view.
      </para>
      <para>
       To the extent to which that Committee deliberates in private, those matters are not necessarily in the public domain. I would never retreat from decisions or positions I had taken in private simply because they had become uncomfortable matters in the public arena. With respect, I resent the dribbling and the obsequious way in which some on the side of the Government are putting around propaganda amongst the people whom they claim to be colleagues of and true believers with that in some way-as was put to me yesterday-Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Knowles were responsible for what we got. If my standing in this Parliament has been so enhanced that I am able to participate in some sort of decision-making which resolves in something constructive I am flattered, but even my foes in the Liberal Party in Western Australia would not dare to suggest that, with fewer than half the numbers, I can win any vote I want.

       Mr President, I understand that you were rather uncomfortable about being confronted with the picket line when you arrived this morning; Senator Collins certainly was; and so was my dear colleague from Western Australia, Senator Giles, to name but three. Perhaps Senator Bolkus overlooked those names when discharging his duties and responsibilities in his enthusiasm to suggest something sinister about Liberal and National Party senators expressing their view that the functioning of Parliament ought not be inhibited as a result of industrial disputation that is reaching down to the bowels of the canteen.

       One does not say lightly, having spent a billion dollars of taxpayers' money, as successive governments have, that there is anything wrong with the construction of this building. We all know that the construction and design of the building in respect to the provision, preparation and service of catering is absolutely appalling. That is reflected, frankly, in the quality of the food and the quality of the service.

       As to what virtue we will see from privatisation, as Senator Hill quite rightly points out, there is sometimes no lesser sin in having a monopoly public sector than there is in having a monopoly private sector. The difference is that one sector tends to look after itself and the other tends to look after its profits. We cannot be certain what we will see down the track, but I ventured into the dining room last night to see what was flowing from the new system and after 17 minutes, having ordered nothing more than a simple hamburger and it having not arrived, I rather wondered whether there was something we had to learn about the private enterprise system of which I was not aware. When it did arrive it was both uncooked and cold.

       Mr President, you probably touched on the question of the cost of the running of the Parliament. I am not going to retrace the steps over which I have trod in previous debates about the functioning of this Parliament and the Government's priorities in terms of its own self-survival at the price of the Parliament being able to function, whatever service it might be. I have never been able to understand why the Speaker, without disclosing the machinations of the Committee, has not been prepared to accept the goodwill and the support that we have offered in terms of going to the Minister for Finance and asking for more substantial funding for this Parliament. I have rather felt I have been talking to Mr Willis and not to the Speaker on more than one occasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       We can only hope that the object will ultimately be achieved. Clearly, Mr President, when you made the decision, you were confronted-given the Government guidelines, or those which were embraced by the Speaker-with either doubling the price of the food or finding a way to cut half the cost. Whether we are going down the right track is yet to be resolved.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have to say that I was rather surprised to see on the news tonight the TLC spokesperson, a young lady, saying that you, Mr President, had in no way engaged in any negotiations with the TLC-which even I do not believe-and that you had not negotiated any redundancy package, which seems to be patently untrue. Knowing the patience with which you chair this chamber, I am sure that you would have gone to a great deal of pain to at least fulfil the guidelines as you initially proposed them at the committee stage. Senator Hill says that we can but wait and see what the ultimate outcome is.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me conclude by saying that I am absolutely appalled that there was an attempt made this morning to deny us normal and reasonable access to Parliament House. Some might suggest that making us walk is reasonable and normal. Some might suggest that it was simply perverse or bloody minded. Whatever, it was an attempt to make it more difficult to get into this building. If the catering service, the TLC or the union movement generally wants to engender goodwill, sympathy or empathy from honourable members and senators, in my view they are going very much the wrong way about it.

        —Firstly, I would like to outline to the Senate that I am a financial member of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia. I would like to outline the concerns that I have with respect to the current dispute. In discussing this matter with the picketers this morning, they indicated to me that there was no problem in my exercising my functions as a parliamentarian. However, I was requested to observe the normal procedures in a dispute like this in ensuring that I do not eat. I can assure honourable senators that at the present time I am starving.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       For the edification of those opposite, I would like now to outline a number of problems that I believe this issue highlights. The first problem is this: is it fair and reasonable that a catering company-and the catering company is Spotless-which was in here in an advisory capacity for some time, I understand, tendered against other companies? Did it tender on an equitable basis against other companies? I would argue that it had far greater access to information as to how the catering service operated in this Parliament. Is it fair and reasonable that Spotless should have been allowed that access over other companies? I pose that point, first of all.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second point I would like to make is this: the wages and conditions of employees as employed by PCS-the award coverage that applied-lapsed when a contractor was brought in. Some of the employees have been re-employed by the contractor. In fact, the new wages and conditions are substantially less than what employees were enjoying to the date of the termination of their employment. The new wages and conditions-depending on the classification and the rate of pay-are some 25 per cent less than the old wages and conditions. The superannuation benefits they received ranged between 10 and 12 per cent. The new superannuation payments are 3 per cent.

        —I am just pointing this out as a matter of fact, so that those people opposite can understand why people react in the way they do when they are confronted with this situation. I would suggest to those opposite that no-one in this building, when confronted with that situation-including honourable senators opposite-would appreciate, when their employment is changed, suffering a severe reduction in wages and conditions, including superannuation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Further to that issue is the issue of continued employment. There is no doubt that, in terms of continued employment, there is a substantial change in the employees' status-moving from a government as an employer to a private contractor. What honourable senators should relate to is that contracts continually change. They may change every three, four or five years. New contracts are let.
      </para>
      <para>
       Certainly, every time a new contract is let, the current employees have no government guarantee of a continuation of their employment. The catering employees are reduced to the level of politicians. Every three or four years, they are required to put their jobs on the line. They are not politicians and I pose the question: is that a reasonable situation in which to place catering employees?

       Another concern relates to the alleged victimisation of an employee who was a union activist. Spotless made some statements to her that she would not gain employment because of her union activity. If those opposite bothered to read the decision-or lack of it-by the Industrial Relations Commission, they would see that it is a technical judgment about whether the Australian Public Service redeployment and redundancy award applied to parliamentary catering staff. That was the issue before the Commission-not the merits of the continued employment of the employees, not the merits of any redundancy pay, and not the merits or otherwise of their continued wages and conditions.
      </para>

       If those opposite read the decision, they would see that the issue that was resolved related to whether the employees were covered by the redeployment and redundancy award.

When original service of the award was made, it was made on Government Ministers and was apparently not made on the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. That is a technical decision. If those opposite believe that will resolve a dispute about people's wages and conditions which have been reduced, about their continued employment and about their continued superannuation, then I doubt that they are right.

       In terms of the savings to be brought about by the introduction of private contractors, I simply make this point in conclusion. Personally, in principle I am not necessarily opposed to contracting provided that in the changeover to a contracting system, the wages, conditions and superannuation and the rights of employment of employees are retained. In some situations, because of economies of scale and the technical knowledge of contract caterers, there is no doubt that there are advantages in having contract catering.
      </para>
      <para>
       If those opposite believe that they will achieve efficiencies and save millions of dollars by quite substantially reducing the wages and conditions of the employees in the Parliamentary Catering Service-which is what happened-and by putting up the price of meals for politicians, then I condemn that utterly. That is the wrong way to go about it. For those reasons, I place my concerns and a number of concerns that fellow senators on this side of the chamber share in this issue on the record.

       This morning I asked you, Mr President, as did other senators, what future action you and the Speaker would take. You said that you could not respond this morning-that we had to wait for this wondrous statement. What precisely do the Presiding Officers intend to do to bring to an end the unlawful picketing of streets by people who are not authorised to stop traffic, who are making a selective judgment about which vehicles are permitted to go past to their destinations and which vehicles are not? By what right are those people doing that, and what action are you taking? What action is contemplated with regard to the action of Comcar drivers who are, presumably, members of the union? I was told this morning that they were instructed by their union as to how to behave. Their union is calling the shots.

       I expect people such as Senator Sherry to stand up and speak as he did. He is the epitome of the ALP, which is the political wing of the trade union movement. Senator Sherry spoke not as a senator, not as an elected representative of the people who are opposed to compulsory unionism, but as a former paid employee of a union. He proudly told us that he was still part and parcel of it. He used his entitlement as a senator to speak, but he spoke wearing his other hat as a trade unionist. So I would have expected him to speak as he did.

       Your own colleagues on the other side of the chamber, Mr President, who did not bother to talk with you about this previously and are taking the opportunity to do so only now, want to weep crocodile tears for 40 or so people who are left out in the cold. But they do not have an apology or a beg-your-pardon for the 800,000 Australians who are out of work, who have lost their jobs-not only their jobs but also their entire life savings-over a period of 20 years or more because of the policies which those opposite have put in place. Where are the crocodile tears being wept for those Australian people? We heard a very self-serving speech by Senator Sherry. No doubt we will hear from one or two other members of the left wing of the ALP and, in particular, those who remain card carrying trade unionists who are committed to compulsory trade unionism.

       There was no problem getting staffers into the building this morning, I understand; there was only a problem for people arriving in Comcars. Mr President, what specific action are you and the Speaker taking to provide vehicles for people to leave this building tonight-that is, vehicles which are not Comcar vehicles, because they are part of the trade union cabal? What are you organising, Mr President, for tomorrow to ensure that people will be here? What are you doing to ensure that we will get the mail that our constituents send to us?

       Finally, what are you doing to lay to rest the hypocrisy that we have been hearing about in this place today where a very small group of people are holding to ransom the business of the Senate?

        —They are picketing because a number of them have lost their jobs. For working people that is extremely important, because they do not have-like Senator Tambling and some of his colleagues might-other businesses to fall back on. Their jobs are all that they have. Very few of them, because of the amount they are paid, have any savings whatsoever. That is why they are picketing. That is why workers take industrial action. The union people who are picketing feel aggrieved by what is happening at the moment.

      <para>
       I am not going to judge whether the grievance is correct or incorrect. I am not going to be supportive of the President's statement here tonight, or against it, because I do not know enough about the individual dispute. There has been a major breakdown in communications in this matter. We were advised by the President this afternoon when he tabled a letter of 14 June about what changes were going to come into place. There has been very little advice since then. In that way, Mr President, I am not castigating you personally in the matter. I am not judging you on it. I am saying-and this is probably an indictment upon myself as a representative of the people-that I did not seek to learn enough about it.
      </para>
      <para>
       If there was any implied criticism of you, Mr President-and I have indicated that there was not-it would have to apply equally to the union people involved, because we have not fully heard their side of the story as yet. Since I returned to Canberra I have made an effort to correct that situation. It is the only way we will ever come to grips with this question or with any matters relating to industrial relations, because there will always be at least two sides to the story.
      </para>
      <para>
       The dispute over the catering services is muddied, because now there are a number of sides to it. We have this morning's action by the Comcar drivers who refused to cross a picket line. We have the actions when police were involved and a couple of people were arrested. That is a very dangerous situation to get into, because, as things roll on and develop, one will lose sight of what the dispute was about in the first place. We can end up with the dispute not being resolved, but with a dozen or more issues that need to be resolved thereafter. It will take the wisdom of Solomon to resolve some of them.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to reiterate a point made by Senator Sherry a short while ago, because a great deal was made of it in Senator Hill's comments to the chamber tonight. I listened carefully, both in the chamber and in my room, to what Senator Hill was saying. I do not believe he was seeking to inflame the situation at all. Senator Hill put a lot of emphasis on the decision by the Commission this afternoon. Senator Sherry put it clearly on the record. The union had made an application, which was its right in law, to have the Commission determine whether its employment conditions came under the Public Service Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987. That is what the application was about.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner gave a relatively short judgment, but he made a number of points in it. As I said earlier, I am not saying that I am an expert. In his conclusion in handing down the decision, Commissioner Smith stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       This decision can not, and should not, be seen as endorsing or rejecting the actions of either party. The merits are not in issue, only the application or otherwise of the award.
      </para>
      <para>
       He continued, and I will quote only part of it:
      </para>
      <para>
       The position put by the union is not unreasonable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, the officers who advise you will understand a great deal more about the meaning of the Commissioner's words because they have had the opportunity of being present in the Commission arguing the case and of reading the transcript, which I have not had. The Commissioner also stated right at the end of the judgment:
      </para>
      <para>
       If the Industrial Relations Act 1988 had not materially changed the approach to be adopted in relation to the presiding officers then it may have been desirable to vary the award.
      </para>
      <para>
       This decision from the Commission today has absolutely nothing to do with whether those people should be employed by the new caterer or by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Catering Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not know where we go from this point. Collectively we have to put the matter in perspective. Certainly we and a number of other people-not only members of Parliament but the people who serve us in carrying out duties on behalf of the people of Australia-have been inconvenienced. A number of inflammatory statements have probably been made. This always happens in an industrial dispute situation, and they are regretted at a later time. Action is needed, reasonably speedily, to resolve this matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are talking of a number of working class people who have very little to fall back on other than their employment and the skills that go with that. They do need employment. A decision has been made by the Presiding Officers, on the advice of the Joint House Committee, and obviously endorsed by the Government. It may be that some elements of that decision are not accurate. Certainly a whole host of questions emanate from that decision. Some of the questions concern members of the catering organisation which currently has the contract. They were actually consultants in this place for an extensive period. In putting forward a tender bid, they obviously would have information available to them which would not have been available to the other 15, 17 or whatever number of bidders there were for the contract. That certainly caused me a little concern when I got to know about it this evening.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, you also advised us of the contract price that has finally been agreed upon. I think your words were-and I will not try to go to the page, but you can certainly correct me if I am misquoting you-that the new contract price was something like $2m, half of what the deficit for this current financial year might be.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have made a disclaimer about your precise words. I have seen some information from the union movement that tells me that the Parliament will subsidise the new caterer to the tune of $1m. That is a statement that has been made. I am not making it; I am repeating an allegation that was made outside. If that is true, a number of questions again need to be asked about the situation that we find ourselves in. We have to put our feet on the ground and try to get an early and speedy resolution to this problem, as a delayed resolution will mean accommodations and compromises, probably on both sides. That may be difficult when people take stances, but it is something that will have to happen.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I urge that whatever can possibly be done to get the aggrieved parties together to resolve this matter at an early date before it escalates indeed be done. I am certain that a number of people could offer advice that might bring about that resolution. I hope that it will happen early. A number of people are hurting because of this, and I am not referring to those of us who have had to walk half a kilometre in the cold.

It has been drawn to my attention that those people on the roads enforcing the picket line at night are not dressed in safety clothing. Are you aware that some of those picketers are so dressed and so position themselves that they are endangering themselves to approaching motorists? I ask you, Mr President, what is the position of the Presiding Officers in relation to an accident involving these people on the pickets operating in the precincts of Parliament House, given that this afternoon the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) gave some sort of endorsement to their actions?

        —Senator McKiernan earlier referred to us as privileged individuals, and in some respects we are, clearly. We are privileged to represent the people of Australia. Each in our respective area has a duty and privilege to do that. I do not myself claim to have the knowledge to discuss the rights and wrongs of the claims of the union. I do, however, as one human being have great sympathy with any human being who has lost a livelihood.

      <para>
       When I arrived at the picket line this morning members of the union came to the window of my car, told me why they were picketing and gave me a piece of paper telling me about it. They said that I should have sympathy with them because they were exercising their right and duty as members of a union to support those of their members who had lost their jobs. I said to them then that I recognised that they were there, in a sense, out of a recognition of a principle of solidarity with their workmates but that I, too, was sitting there in my car and would not move also for a principle and that principle to me, in that circumstance, takes priority over the principle for which they were standing in the road.
      </para>
      <para>
       The principle for which I sat firm was that the work of the Parliament and the representatives of the people must not be impeded, and I claimed the right of passage along that thoroughfare as a senator, not as a private individual. In no way do I claim to be privileged in the sense of my own person; I claim it for the people whom I represent. Therefore, it was in every sense a philosophical confrontation, if you like-a very civilised confrontation. There have been allegations this evening that I might have been one of the senators who was accused by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) of threatening a driver with losing his job. I take this opportunity-as I have already taken it earlier with the press-to say that I unequivocally deny that I ever threatened any person throughout the whole of this morning's activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       I stayed in that car for an hour and a quarter asking for passage through a picket line to fulfil my role as a representative of the people of Australia. I may have been inconvenienced, but that was not the point-it was not me as an individual, as a private citizen. I made no inflammatory statements. No inflammatory statements, in fact, were made to me. But I do have to put on the record that the answer which the Minister gave to me today was incorrect. Although my driver told me that he could not cross the picket line because he was a member of the TWU, and although I was present when the union organiser told him he could not cross the picket line, he had previously, in my presence and over the Comcar radio net, been told by Comcar that in no circumstances-despite the fact that he said a senator had given him a direction, which I claim is lawful, of course-was he to cross the picket line.

The Minister today, in telling the Senate that the TWU had directed the drivers and that Comcar had not intervened in the matter-which I think is roughly a translation of what he told the Senate-was incorrect. He misled the Senate. Mr President, I draw that to your attention as a serious reflection on that Minister and on his credibility. I think it is a dereliction of his duty to the people of Australia to discuss this matter in an honest and open fashion.
       </para>

      <para>
       As a senator I take great exception to Senator Bolkus misleading the Senate, as I do to his implication that I and other of my colleagues may have threatened drivers. I certainly deny that on my own behalf. As other honourable senators have already explained, this is a difficult situation. I want my role this morning to be on the record in case it is misunderstood. Whether in my dealings with the driver, the people on the picket line or the police, all conversations over that hour and a quarter this morning were conducted in a civilised and proper manner. Each of us in our corners believed we were supporting a principle.

       However, as a senator representing the people of Australia, I still have to claim that the principle of the Senate's work being undertaken without any impediment and the work of a senator-especially in gaining access to the Senate-should not be impeded in any way. That has to be the primary goal and it has to be beyond question. Therefore I urge you, Mr President, and the other Presiding Officer to see that in no way is democracy ever hindered in its work, because although in some respects this may be seen to be a little matter of a few senators being required to walk up a hill, it is a principle which if taken any further--

         —Order! Before I call Senator Cooney, I seek the indulgence of the Senate to make a statement at this stage. I do this although I do not close the debate. I have been asked a number of questions tonight and I want to deal with a couple of them quickly. In response to Senator Watson, I believe the picketers are not in the precincts of Parliament House; they are outside its precincts. This Parliament has operated during various industrial disputes in the past and will continue to operate in the future. As I said in an earlier statement today, while I am a Presiding Officer I will do everything in my power to ensure that the Parliament operates.

        I have been asked a number of questions tonight about the tender process. I again say to certain honourable senators that I will make available the people who sat on the tendering committee-I was not in Australia at the time-to reassure them that the information they have been given is wrong. Senator Sherry was one of only five senators and members who wrote to the Presiding Officers when the circular went out on 14 June, and everything he said tonight he put in a letter to the Presiding Officers at that stage.

        I have been asked a number of questions tonight about whether people are getting their mail. At a meeting with the Black Rod prior to coming here this evening I was assured that honourable senators and members are getting their mail, that mail is getting out and that newspapers are getting in. They may not be on time, but they are getting in. The reason I make a statement at this stage is quite simply that Senator Hill and Senator Bishop both asked me, `Where are we now?'. I can tell honourable senators that the position is still very fluid; I am doing everything I can to avoid disruption. I am unable to give honourable senators any guarantees about transport tonight or in the morning.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make this statement because a series of meetings is now about to take place in my office to try to ensure that the questions asked by honourable senators are resolved by 10.30 p.m. and also that arrangements are in place to bring honourable senators into parliament tomorrow morning. As I have said, I do not want to close the debate. I have been asked about a number of issues and I want to leave the chamber and address those issues at this stage.

Some people on the other side have invited you, Mr President, to do what you are about to do-that is, discuss the issue. As Senator Sherry and Senator McKiernan have said, we are in a difficult position. There is a clash of rights and principles and clearly, as we all know, the Senate chamber is not the most happy forum in which to negotiate the settlement of a dispute.

       I have not heard anybody say tonight that these people who are on strike and who have served us over the years in the dining room and elsewhere are anything but decent people. What honourable senators have said is that these people are taking action which disturbs the running of the Senate. I think that is a fair point to make. But it seems to me that there has been nothing in the discussion so far to say that we should in some way impeach or in any way punish the people out there before there is a proper discussion about the matter and that, as I understand it, is what the President is doing now.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, one of the problems concerns this decision taken today. It is a decision which, in a certain sense, is not a decision at all because the Industrial Relations Commission has said that it does not have the jurisdiction to settle this dispute. It has had to come back to us, as a parliament, and to the officers whom we all respect-the President and the Speaker. As the President has said, he is going off to discuss that issue now.

      <para>
       I think it is a healthy debate, but I do not think that we can come to any conclusions tonight about what ought or ought not to be done. The people on the other side have said that their legitimate purpose is to make sure they can come here to legislate. That right has certainly not been disturbed today. Whatever else has happened, it is quite clear that the function that this chamber performs has not been disturbed and is not being disturbed now. What is at issue is the fact that people on both sides of the Senate are disturbed by people who feel-and I would have thought feel most legitimately-that they have been badly used.

I can understand and I share his concern because he pointed out-as I did early this morning-that there seems to have been a gross injustice done. On 6 June, 7 June, 11 June and right up until 21 June, negotiations were undertaken with the staff of the Parliamentary Catering Service.
       </para>

      <para>
       The staff understood and were given certain promises and the Department of Finance reneged on those promises. I am sure that the Speaker and the President, with all the goodwill in the world, negotiated the deal that they thought would be best for the staff and would cause less friction. It was the Department of Finance and, indeed, the Government's policy that caused the problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       What happens in a company if a manager makes a promise to staff and then he is let down by the boss, by the owner? I would imagine that the manager would resign if he were not supported by the boss, having negotiated and made certain promises to the staff. It seems to me that a very similar situation has occurred, which is the main problem. As I said, promises were made to the staff with all the goodwill in the world of the President and the Speaker. They have been overridden by the Department of Finance and by the Government's policy. I think that the Government, the Department of Finance and the Minister have a lot to answer for. It is up to the Minister to finalise the situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand the President's concern. It is his responsibility to oversee the functioning of the Senate. We are sitting a week earlier than the House of Representatives, so the Speaker, at least, is relieved of any responsibility at the moment. What will happen next week if this matter remains unresolved? This should be of great concern to us all. If it is not resolved in the next 24 hours, next week we will have a problem that is so great that members of the staff who are already serving here will find it very difficult to continue to do so. I believe that the Department of Finance should now step in and do the right thing.

      <para>
       I ask: who are the people picketing? I have been in this place for 14 years and I have never seen the three people who picketed the road I came in on. It may be that they have been working in the building for 30 years. All I can say with absolute vehemence is that I have never seen them before. I refer to the President's speech, where he said that only 46 of the former 160 or 170 staff have not been reappointed. Of those 46 staff a number have retired and a number have taken alternative employment. That leaves at most about 30 people who could form these pickets. I wonder whether we have some of the rent-a-mob crowd out on the access roads causing us trouble.
      </para>
      <para>
       I make no apology for my view that the actions of those people who hindered the access of parliamentarians to this chamber today are in contempt of the Parliament and they should be brought to account for that. There is contempt of the Parliament when Commonwealth drivers refuse to obey a lawful command. That lawful command is to drive through the picket line and deliver a senator, whom they have contracted to deliver, to the Parliament. If the drivers are not prepared to fulfil that contract, why did they pick us up in the first place? If they are not prepared to honour the agreement, why do the job in a half-hearted manner? By conforming to union pressures, the drivers place themselves in a position of supporting a secondary boycott, which is specifically prohibited in legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       We heard on the ABC news tonight that the TLC-chamber or council, whatever the body in Canberra is called-has rejected the IRC decision today. It will go ahead and maintain the picket line. I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, representing the President, that this is an absolutely intolerable situation. The fundamental right of a parliamentarian to have access to Parliament House is being compromised by the actions of these people. It is contempt of the Parliament, and the situation must be corrected as soon as possible.

         —In speaking to the motion put forward earlier today by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I can state that for many years-in fact, for the entire time of our existence as a political party and for as long as we have been in this chamber-the Australian Democrats have been very conscious of the need to break the hold of the mighty dollar over the democratic process. We must, as I think the Minister said earlier, do something about the reliance of the political process on the corporate dollar.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Democrats have a fine record in this chamber on electoral reform issues. We have consistently tried to make the electoral process more open to all candidates and political parties and more readily understood by the general public. We have tried repeatedly to simplify our complex electoral laws and to inspire greater public confidence in the electoral process. We have been involved in reforms of many kinds based on these goals and principles: public funding; the disclosure of campaign funding; the naming of political parties on ballot papers and a range of other measures, all of which were designed to open up the political process and make it more effective and efficient.
       </para>
       <para>
        The story of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, about which the Minister has moved a motion to have it sent off to a committee, is one that we are all aware of but one that has been surrounded by some mystery from time to time, and misrepresentation. It began earlier this year with a proposal from the Minister, which later emerged by way of legislation, that two things should happen at once under the same piece of legislation: that paid electronic political advertisements be banned totally, all year, all the time; and that there be full disclosure of political funds, political donations.
       </para>
       <para>
        From the outset the Democrats opposed the Government's proposition for a complete ban on electronic advertising. We agreed with the Opposition about that. Of course, that immediately put us in a balance of power position when we did not agree with the Opposition that the whole Bill should go to a committee immediately and be taken off the agenda. On the one hand, we agreed with the Opposition and, on the other hand, we were absolutely delighted to find the Australian Labor Party, the Hawke Government, move from its position in 1984 for campaign disclosure only and go all the way to full disclosure of political donations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the beginning that became our complete goal. In 1984 the Hawke Government came forward with legislation to disclose campaign funding. It could have gone all the way; it had the numbers in this chamber. But on that occasion, as we see now, it lined up with the Opposition. It conceded to the Opposition, which did not want to see that full disclosure.

         —It is a story that is well known but has often been misrepresented. The question of full disclosure of campaign funding has been a major matter of principle for the Democrats since our inception. We imposed it upon ourselves in our original constitution and we pursued it year after year in this Parliament.
        </para>

       <para>
        In 1984 the Hawke Government failed to go all the way and capitulated to the Opposition. I do not know why, because it did not have to. We were pleased with this year's move but it was inexorably linked by the Government to its blanket ban on advertising with which both the Opposition and the Democrats totally disagreed. The Government used its proposed advertising ban like a sword of Damocles. In April of this year, in introducing this legislation and by the public statements of the Minister, the Government used its proposed ban on political advertising like the sword of Damocles over the head of full and open disclosure of political funding. That is a position which the Government maintained until last week.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's original proposal to split the Bill and send parts of it off to committees was totally rejected by the Government on the basis that the legislation would not proceed unless it proceeded intact. As the Opposition chooses to ignore in its misrepresentative public campaign, the Government runs the show around here. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) sits there in the full knowledge--

        If a Minister says, `We will not put this Bill forward unless we can do so in its entirety', and he means it, then that Bill disappears. That is exactly what the Opposition wanted all along. It is a matter of regret to the Democrats that tonight the Opposition is going a long way down that track, having persuaded the Government to go down that track with it. Nevertheless, the Minister says he is committed to bringing it back after due process in committee and we will have to see whether that happens.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1984, the Government gave way to the Opposition. I fear that is what it has done again in this case. The goal of the Democrats all along, since this legislation was first put forward in April of this year, has been to ensure the implementation of full disclosure of political donations. Until last week the Government refused to move. Nevertheless, the Democrats stayed in the negotiations because one fact was clear: we did not support the Government's proposed ban, so there would be advertisements. That was clear. We have another policy; not just the policy of disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can count like the Minister. If the Democrats and the Opposition opposed his blanket ban, then clearly there would be ads. That makes sense. The Democrats have other policies besides disclosure, and one of those is a policy about truth in advertising. It is a longstanding policy which is written down and which has been acted upon in this chamber most recently by the former Leader of the Democrats, Senator Macklin, as he then was, in May of last year. That policy reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Political advertising will be regulated so that the obligations that apply to companies with regard to truth and accuracy in advertising under the Trade Practices Act will also apply to political advertising under the Electoral Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the moment the Electoral Act is a licence to lie, which members of the Opposition quite enjoy and which, frankly, members of the Government quite enjoy. However, the Democrats do not. It is a matter of policy-and I have just quoted point 14 of our electoral reform policy-that truth in advertising is a major project for us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Former Senator Macklin moved amendments, after negotiating year after year to bring them down to the most simple amendments we could get to, to try to get the Government and the Opposition, or the Government or the Opposition, to agree to. That was what we needed to pursue, given that there would be advertisements. We would not ban advertisements, so we stayed in the negotiations in order to do two things: to save disclosure from being shoved off either by the Government or by the Opposition, and to make sure that since we would have advertisements they would be forced at least to be truthful.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the public record, let me say that we have never kidded ourselves that we could stop politicians from making promises that they could not fulfil or from being misleading. At the very base, our amendments to the Electoral Act to bring truth into advertising are the simplest matters of fact. That is all we think we can do, but it is something that we believe is worth striving to do as there will be political advertisements in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we stayed in the negotiations and up came the smokescreen from the Opposition, terrified that it had failed on its first attempt to get rid of the disclosure proposition. What was it going to do if it had to open up its books to the general public? I must say that I was amazed that the ALP was prepared to do that anyway. Up went the smokescreen with all this stuff about the Democrats being on the Government side with its blanket ban about deals but, as Opposition senators very well know, they were negotiations.

As I said, we also share with the Government an enormous concern about the costs of campaigns. We have a policy for the regulation of advertisements and, as I say, there will be advertisements, because we have opposed that blanket ban all along. We have kept disclosure alive until today. We have stayed in the negotiations, which would have been dead if the Opposition had had its way in April or at any stage since.

        This is where I want to talk about negotiating with Senator Parer. We should be having disclosure now. I thought it would be today, but possibly even tomorrow we would be having full disclosure. It is open to us to do that. The Opposition says that it is strongly in support of disclosure provisions. Senator Parer was vehement in his speech. Therefore, I contend that we in the Senate tonight should not be referring that section of the Bill with regard to disclosure off to this committee. Senator Bolkus referred to his concern that the Liberal Party is establishing a slush fund right now, I think properly referred to as a trust account.

        Either the Opposition has a strong commitment, will join us and will allow us to work towards disclosure now and not at some later date after something crawls back out of a committee; or the Government, genuinely concerned about what the Opposition might be going on with, ought to be doing that if the Opposition does not.

         —Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is everyone's opportunity to come up with something genuine about their so-called commitment to disclosure. I heard Senator Vanstone ask the question: is part 3 of the Bill perfect? No, Senator Vanstone, but when we are dealing here with legislation that is not perfect, it is customary to amend it. The Democrats have amendments; no doubt the Opposition has got amendments. That is something that we can do in this place; it is something that we always do in this place.

        It is very clear that what Opposition senators wanted us to do all along was to take precipitate action which they knew would sink the whole legislation. They should be absolutely joyous tonight that they have gone a fair way down that track, not with the Democrats' connivance, not by a deal with the Democrats, but with the Government. Senator Bolkus himself was obliging the Opposition by sending this off to a committee instead of dealing with it today. The Government's brinkmanship on this all along has made it really clear that that is what would have happened if we had been precipitate, which is exactly what the Opposition wanted us to do. We avoided that. We stayed in the negotiations and we have moved the Government. Now we have got Tweedledum and Tweedledee back again, revisited-the Government obliging the Opposition to send the Bill to a committee.

       <para>
        Part 3 can stand here in the Senate and be dealt with, if my amendment passes. However, if the Opposition and the Government fail to support my amendment-which will not surprise me-there is a second chance. As honourable senators will be aware from notices of motion this morning, tomorrow I will be introducing a private member's Bill-something the Opposition said it would do if advertising went to a committee, but where is it?-which constitutes the disclosure provisions of the Government's legislation, plus the Democrats amendments.

However, if Opposition senators, who have General Business access much more often than the Democrats, really want to get this up, I am very happy for that to happen. The Bill will be there and it will be a reminder that disclosure has been before this chamber, should still be before this chamber, and should have been passed by this chamber, albeit amended from the Government's legislation, if necessary.

        I think it is inevitable-I accept it; I can count, too, as the Minister said-that both parts of this Bill will go off to a committee. I assure the Senate-because the Minister, perhaps, put a question mark over this-that the Democrats will meet the challenge that the Minister talked about, as we have thus far. We will continue to work for the passage of legislation to ensure full, open and contemporaneous disclosure of political donations. Because there will be political advertisements, we will pursue our policy-which we have pursued throughout the years and which we continue to make a major priority-of truth in advertising and any other advertising regulations which are going to that goal of ours to improve the electoral process and to make it more open and accessible.

        The Opposition wants the status quo-no change. The Democrats want reform. The Opposition has tried to ditch a most progressive piece of legislation-at least one part of it-for many months now. As I said, the Democrats want reform in the electoral process. We have a fine record, and here I pay tribute to my former colleague Senator Macklin for all the work that he has done over the years in that area. We want to add now to the reforms that we have made in the past. We will not shrink from our goals and our policies, in spite of all the pressure being exerted by the Opposition or the Government, whose own commitment must now be in question. The Democrats' views, our amendments and our determination for reform will all be before that committee. Meanwhile, we stress that this is a black day for the Senate-when we had the opportunity to open up the books of all political parties and organisations involved in political campaigns, and we have failed to do it. Nevertheless, the challenge goes first--

         —The motion before the chamber this evening is the culmination of a series of very sad and confusing sagas, particularly in the area of trying to understand the game played by the Australian Democrats. In looking at the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 which was before the Senate, and which the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) now seeks to place before a committee for further consideration, we need to look very carefully at its two important, discrete parts. The first relates to broadcasting, and the second relates to disclosure.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Suspicion surrounds the proposal to ban political advertising on television and radio at all times. I say `suspicion' because people are questioning the motives of the Hawke Federal Government and, more importantly, weighing up the costs of muzzling our democratic right to free speech. Basically, the ban will end political advertising on two of the most important channels of communication-television and radio. Advertisements can continue in the press or direct mail, but if a government introduces legislation which is abhorrent to an individual or to groups of individuals, it will be illegal for them to air their views on radio or television advertisements.
       </para>
       <para>
        From my point of view, it is even worse for the people who are living in rural and remote Australia and who have limited access to newspapers and direct mail. The irony is that, whilst radio and television have brought regional and metropolitan Australia closer together, the Hawke Labor Government is trying to force political communication back to the nineteenth century.
       </para>
       <para>
        The people that I would identify as being most affected are those living in the Federal electorates of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia; Grey in South Australia; the Northern Territory, with which I am familiar; Kennedy, Maranoa and Leichhardt in Queensland; and Riverina-Darling in New South Wales. Under the ban it is particularly important to note that Aborigines, like other Australians in remote and rural areas, will be denied the right to hear the views of political parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely this makes an absolute mockery of the policies of the Australian Democrats and the position they are now taking and the policies of the Hawke Labor Government, which has put a separate piece of legislation on today's Notice Paper seeking a special council of reconciliation in the Aboriginal portfolio. We are talking about the participation of Aboriginal Australians in the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Understandably, the proposed advertising ban has come under fire from civil liberties groups, the editorials of major Australian newspapers and a range of community organisations. The Northern Territory Police Association, for example, describes itself as a non-political body, yet it has grave concerns about the effect of such a ban on its freedom to speak publicly, particularly in relation to professional matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Looking further at the Northern Territory, I note that the amendments made by the Bill to the Broadcasting Act 1942 break with recent convention by not treating the Northern Territory as a State. Consequently, the category of matter which will be prohibited under the broadcast ban during the lead-up to a Northern Territory election will be wider than that prohibited during the lead-up to a State election.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, during the lead-up to a State election, the broadcast of political advertisements will be prohibited. During the lead-up to a Territory or Commonwealth election, the Bill will ban the broadcast of any matter other than exempt matter, for or on behalf of the Government or a government authority of the Territory or the Commonwealth. I therefore support the efforts of the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, to amend the Bill so that the Northern Territory can be treated consistently with the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The hidden agenda of this Bill was highlighted by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, when he said that it was designed to give Labor a slim chance of winning the next election. He told the House of Representatives in May this year that the legislation:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . is designed to stop us from running advertisements on radio and television that are critical of the Government and draw attention to the inadequacies of the Government. It is designed to stop any attempt to remind Australians of the hardship, the very genuine hardship, that the Government has inflicted unnecessarily on so many Australians and their families. It is simply designed to save the Government's political skin.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second part of the legislation under consideration deals with disclosure of donations received by political parties. Of course, disclosure has the support of all parties in the Federal Parliament, so much so that the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in May this year urging him not to jeopardise the spirit of tripartisan cooperation by linking the advertising ban with disclosure provisions. Yet the Federal Government refused to split the Bill and, in so doing, refused us the opportunity to deal with each issue on its merits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Needless to say, the coalition supports full, fair and equitable disclosure of political donations. Firstly, we want to ensure that no donor to a political party is singled out for punitive action by a government or a third party as a result of making a donation. Secondly, we want to ensure that parties have a common position so that there is no tax advantage from donations made by unions to the ALP. Thirdly, we want to ensure that donations are voluntary. I sincerely trust that these issues will be most prominent in the consideration of the committee to which this Bill will be referred.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ALP practice of completing election disclosure returns has made a mockery of the very legislation it introduced in the 1980s. The Labor Party has consistently breached the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. I draw the Senate's attention to the various returns lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission, particularly the one that I am most familiar with, the 1987 return of the Northern Territory Federal Labor member, Warren Snowdon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Different versions of Mr Snowdon's return wound up being on public display in Electoral Commission offices in Darwin and Canberra. Inquiries ascertained that they had been subsequently altered in Canberra by clerks of the Electoral Commission after requests for amendment by Mr Snowdon. I had to challenge Mr Snowdon to clarify his position and to clarify why there were different forms, different returns and different amounts of money shown on those returns of the Labor Party and Mr Snowdon. These were most important.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also draw the Senate's attention to a question I placed on notice in the Senate on 20 June, before we rose for the winter recess. I directed a question to the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, who is the Minister with responsibility for this Bill. In question No. 990, listed on page 171 of today's Notice Paper, I raised a number of issues relating to disclosed donations on the ALP returns for 1987, which raised a number of possible conflicts of interest with a real estate development company in the Northern Territory and actions of the Department of Administrative Services, the Department which Senator Bolkus now administers. It was a request for information in regard to various meetings between the Minister, other Federal Ministers and Mr Snowdon, and the solicited party donations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I specifically asked questions about the relationship between Senator Bolkus and the donor of $5,000 to the Northern Territory ALP with regard to the re-election of Mr Snowdon. That was six weeks ago. I have not been given an answer in the interim period, and I will certainly pursue it with Senator Bolkus at the end of Question Time tomorrow when I will ask him, under the 30-day rule, to give me an explanation as to why no answer has been given to that very important question, particularly in light of this debate relating to disclosure. I wonder whether it is not subtly part of the reason the Government may be backing off on this legislation and tending to hide it at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The debate in this place and the position that the Australian Democrats have taken disappoint us. The Democrats are the self-proclaimed guardians of civil liberties. Over recent months I have heard media reports of Senator Bolkus trying to do backroom deals with the Democrats over the political advertising issue. Such reports leave me questioning the sincerity of the Federal Government as well as the sincerity of the Party claiming to `keep the bastards honest'. I refer to an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of 4 July, during the winter recess, which warns:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, has left the Democrats no other option but to reject the Federal Government's legislation designed to ban electronic political advertising. When legislation is as bad as this legislation is, rejection rather than a compromise is the only proper political response. As Mr Burdekin has advised the Democrats, their proposed compromise law would still be in breach of Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the motives of the Hawke Labor Government? First, the ban is a ruthless attempt to gag criticism from the Federal coalition and interest groups in the run-up to the next election. Secondly, Labor sees it as a cure to the massive financial hangover it suffered at the last election-a hangover, I might add, said to have cost between $7m and $10m. The last word on political advertising must go to the Professor of Law at the Queensland University of Technology, Christopher Gilbert, who has been reported as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not surprising that television has been targeted. It is the most influential medium of our age. All modern dictators place control of television stations among their top priorities. The Saddam Husseins of this world know the power of ``the box''. So apparently does Mr Hawke.

        Senator Powell's colleagues and branch members were clearly outraged that the Leader of their Party could even contemplate doing a deal on this legislation.

We only have to listen to the President of the Queensland branch of the Australian Democrats who just last week on the radio was attacking Senator Powell for dealing with the Government over this issue.

       <para>
        Of course this Bill should be referred to a committee. But it took the Government three months of twisting and turning before it finally accepted the position of the Liberal-National Party coalition. Three days ago, Senator Bolkus made his final attempt to attract the Democrats. He offered a ban on election advertising only during election campaigns. Now he has been forced to put this Bill to a committee, which in the past was the policy of the Democrats. Their policy was always to put controversial Bills to Senate committees. Suddenly, when this Bill appeared, that policy went out the window. I suggest to Senator Powell that she will be going out the window fairly soon after it, if one can judge from the comments of her own supporters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition supports political disclosure. There is no question about that. There is great irony in the Labor Party bringing forward this legislation at this time. Senator Bolkus, in his opening remarks on the motion to refer the Bill to a committee, said that he was worried about the political dollar dictating the political agenda. He was worried about what he described as the `potential for stark and direct corruption'. He was worried about the potential for what he described as undue influence and its impact on the electoral process.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no mention in Senator Bolkus's speech of the possible corrupting effect of the union dollar. This was referred to by Senator Tambling. In the Electoral Act there are some astonishing anomalies, untouched by this Bill which has been brought before the Parliament, in the union dollar and the relationship between unions and the Labor Party. In reference to the corporate dollar, Senator Bolkus must have been persuaded by Labor Party experience and the influence that the corporate dollar may have had on the Labor Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was no coincidence that this Bill was floated in speculation in the press just before the royal commission in Western Australia commenced its hearings. We should remember that; in politics they call it the pre-emptive strike. Senator Bolkus started to talk about disclosure only when threatened with what can only be described as the greatest disclosure scandal in Australian history which directly affected the Labor Party. That is the background to this Bill being brought before this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        The section to ban political advertising is motivated entirely by the Labor Party's proposal to inhibit the Opposition from reminding the public at the next election of the lies of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-make no mistake about that-his lies about the recession; his promises in the last election about higher living standards for Australian workers; and his lie, repeated day after day in the last election campaign, about his commitment to stay on for another three years. Day after day, we can all recall, Mr Hawke made this lie to the Australian public while at the same time he had made a commitment to Mr Keating to stand down. Of course the Labor Party does not want the public to be reminded about those lies or that famous picture of the three corporate donors in the rowboat with the Prime Minister, not to mention the historic photograph of Mr Hawke, Mr Bond, Laurie Connell and the boys from the John Curtin Foundation. Mr Hawke does not want the public to be reminded of those deals.
       </para>
       <para>
        In attempting to justify his broken promise to Mr Keating, the Prime Minister confessed that, in his view, anything was justified in order to win an election. That is a fair statement of the principles of our Prime Minister. They are not the statements, and do not in any way represent the principles, of the Australian public. That is why the Prime Minister and Senator Bolkus were prepared to attempt to limit freedom of speech in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        To illustrate the position of the Labor Party on disclosure, I will quote a famous American State legislator, half of whose constituents were Bible belt Baptists while the other half were keen consumers of moonshine. When asked his position on banning alcohol prohibition, the legislator said that he was in favour of the law but was not in favour of enforcing it. The Labor Party during its term of office has shown that it is in favour of disclosure laws but not in favour of enforcing them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make some comments about the Labor Party's record on disclosure. The Labor Party has spent much of the last nine years trying to avoid the disclosure laws as set out in its own legislation. ALP gifts and legacies were set up after 1984 to launder gifts to the ALP. We are delighted that Senator McMullan is in the chamber because he will remember the famous letter that he wrote in 1985 to a large list of private companies telling them how to avoid Electoral Act requirements which the Labor Party had enacted. Does Senator McMullan remember that?
       </para>
       <para>
        In the 1987 campaign, $2m was laundered through ALP legacies and gifts. In January 1988, the Labor Party tripped very badly over its hypocrisy on the matter of its own disclosure laws. All of us in this chamber remember the famous Harris Daishowa case, which ended up with Mick Young resigning from this Parliament, all over the Labor Party's behaviour on disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then came the daddy of them all-the famous gold tax luncheon in the run-up to the 1987 election. Both Laurie Connell and Alan Bond said they received guarantees about the gold tax policy of the Labor Party at that particular luncheon at which, I might say, the Labor Party received $1m-not a bad sum. I can tell Senator Faulkner that not a cent of it was declared. The Labor Party is in favour of disclosure laws; the Labor Party is not in favour of enforcing disclosure laws. We can judge that from its own behaviour over a very long period. If the Labor Party is fair dinkum about disclosure, it will be tested at the forthcoming committee hearings.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the issues that this committee should turn its mind to to ensure proper disclosure and equity? Let us start with Senator Faulkner's union mates for, after all, as comrade Ferguson has told us, the unions are part and parcel of the Government. Contributions to unions which are passed on to the ALP are tax deductible; donations to the Liberal Party are not tax deductible. This is a matter that this committee will have to investigate. Individuals who are forced to join unions are also then forced to contribute to the Labor Party through compulsory union dues. I ask Senator Faulkner whether this is fair. After all, 40 to 50 per cent of union members vote for the Liberal Party. I think the committee should certainly turn its mind to that particular issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about the role of the Government in providing huge amounts of money by way of government grants to the union movement, and then receiving back from the unions campaign contributions? The ACTU-just to remind Senator Faulkner-has received over $12m from the Government since the ALP came to office. The union movement overall has probably received $30m. Part of John Curtin House was apparently purchased by the ACTU to help fund Labor's debts of over $4m. We do not know the actual details of that transaction-nothing has been disclosed. The people who are talking about disclosure all the time have got an awful lot to disclose, I suggest to those opposite, about the money that was spent to purchase John Curtin House-how that money was raised and what that money was used for. Let us have a little bit of disclosure about that. I hope that this will be a matter of discussion at the hearings of the committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        My colleagues have outlined in some detail the opposition of many community groups to the Government's attempt to ban freedom of speech. These groups, happily, will have a chance to produce their evidence before this committee.

        What did the Australian Democrats do? They rejected that request. The explanation given today by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell, is that these two matters are inexorably linked. By that the Leader of the Democrats means that the Government has sucked the Democrats into believing that, unless they went along with these two matters staying together, all the legislation-this trojan horse of a Bill-would be lost. The Australian Democrats were so unprepared to follow their generally principled views about matters going before a committee and legislation dealing with one matter and one matter alone that they were prepared to forsake those views and go along with the Government in the hope that something better would happen.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats now say that as a consequence of their prevarication on this matter the Bill is being referred to a select committee, which we all know is utter rubbish. In particular the Democrats wanted to raise this evening their view that the coalition has not properly supported their demands for truth in advertising. Senator Powell would have done well to mention the reply she received from the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Burdekin, in respect of her proposals on this matter. The Human Rights Commissioner told Senator Powell that proposals for truth in advertising, as outlined by the Democrats, may well suppress political debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senators on the Government side of the House might not think much of the concept of legislative proposals in some way suppressing political debate, but it is very germane to this matter. In fact the Human Rights Commissioner suggests that would be the consequence of implementing the proposals of the Australian Democrats. These proposals for truth in advertising-and in fact for others in relation to limits on advertising-have been referred to in the United States as having a chilling effect. That is, people-be they broadcasting licensees, people who place advertisements or whoever-become so apprehensive about the risks of contravening the law as enacted that they fall short of what they actually could do and say far less than the law allows them to say; namely, the effect is a substantial reduction in the amount of political information put forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        One can talk about what the Human Rights Commissioner has said. Quite simply, while I do not disagree with anything I have read in respect of what Mr Burdekin has said thus far, I do not take that alone as the guiding light. One can look at what the Cato Institute, Article 19 and all sorts of foreign organisations have to say for advice on the importance of freedom of expression in the proper operation of a free democracy and one can quote them if one will.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I think before even bothering to go to those sorts of advisers one should ask oneself what one believes in and how the system one believes in could operate if the legislation as proposed were enacted. I happen to believe in a democratic system where people-however I may judge them as individuals and however they may judge me-have the opportunity to vote and to say whom they want to govern them. It is the old story of only the wearer can tell whether the shoe pinches. I am not one of those people who says, `Let us go to those we think know best and follow what they say'. It has to be a blend between taking advice from people who are specialists in a particular area and understanding what the electorate wants and giving it the opportunity to express that view.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one follows that line of thought, one comes to the point that Senator Bolkus and the Democrats have totally missed in this debate. I put before the chamber three quotes that I think make this abundantly clear. The first, which is for the benefit of members opposite rather than for the Democrats, is from Mr Justice Lionel Murphy, who recognised the importance of free political expression at election times in a case that has been described as Ansett Transport Industries Pty Ltd v. the Commonwealth. In that case, he had this to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . election of Federal Parliament provided for in the Constitution requires freedom of movement, speech and other communication, not only between the States, but in and between every part of the Commonwealth. From these provisions and from the concept of the Commonwealth arises an implication of a constitutional guarantee of such freedoms,-
       </para>
       <para>
        this is the important part-
       </para>
       <para>
        freedoms so elementary that it was not necessary to mention them in the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the former Senator Murphy, then Justice Lionel Murphy, was saying was that if democracy is to work there has to be freedom of expression. It is just so obvious that he was saying even the founding fathers thought one need not mention it in framing the Constitution. It is so obvious that a blatant idiot could not miss it. That was what Murphy was saying. I do not know where that leaves Senator Bolkus and others who support this Bill, but that was the point he was making. If we want a democratic election and if we want people to be able to vote on the basis of some sort of informed choice, we have to allow them to be informed; we cannot do that by restricting the information which they receive.
       </para>
       <para>
        This point has not been lost on the Australian Law Council, which also sees freedom of expression as fundamental to the fair running of elections. Reminding the Government of a comment by the International Commission of Jurists, the Council said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Freedom of expression through the press and other media of communication is an essential element of free elections and is also necessary to ensure the development of an informed and responsible electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In effect, they are saying the same thing. We can talk until we are blue in the face about the international obligations of section 19 and we can draw comparisons between that and article 1 of the United States constitution-which is loosely referred to as the freedom of expression requirement-but that article and the United States freedom of expression requirement relate to expression in general. They cover all sorts of expression and say that, in general, you and I ought to be able to be free to say what we choose.
       </para>
       <para>
        But what these quotes are saying is that the right to freedom of political expression is much more fundamental than the right to freedom of expression in general. Murphy recognised that and the Law Council has recognised that. Freedom of political expression is far more important; it is more central to the existence and proper functioning of a democracy than freedom of any other expression. To express that view does not necessarily concede the right to limit other forms of expression, but it does concede that the right to freedom of political expression is absolutely central.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those who follow politics in the United States will know that the United States Solicitor General, Robert Bork, was very conservative. He was criticised by many liberal jurists for his views. But he put forward the view that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . representative democracy (is) a form of Government that would be meaningless without freedom to discuss government and its policies. Freedom for political speech could and should be inferred even if there were no first amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are the points that have been missed. Everybody has been running off to the Human Rights Commissioner asking for advice on some variation of article 19-asking would it fit in or would it not-without coming back to this basic question: can the institution of democracy survive if the electors have some limit imposed on the information that is forwarded to them?
       </para>
       <para>
        For the Democrats to come in here tonight, particularly Senator Powell, simply under the pressure of a leadership challenge, and say that they have never supported a ban-only as a consequence of interjections from this side do they admit that they have never supported a total ban-is somewhat hypocritical. The Democrats have never said outright that they would support no ban whatsoever. They have always left it open to some sort of bargaining. Senator Spindler now admits that they want some sort of bargaining, something to trade here on this matter. We on this side have said that freedom of political expression is not a tradable commodity. It is not something we hold out for some sort of concession here or there to see where we are going to get. This is the point that the Democrats have absolutely missed and simply not understood. It is an important point.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make a couple more points. I will be brief because I know that there are other people who want to speak on this matter. I have just been reminded of those who do. There seems to be some acceptance abroad-perhaps even amongst some of my colleagues-that we should be worried about the cost of advertising for elections. I do not know why we instantly rush to that acceptance. I do not rush to that acceptance at all. I looked at the last report of who spent what at the last election-it may have been the election before it-and concluded that about $16m was spent. It works out at about $1.60 a voter. Some hare-brained scheme has been put forward by one of the Democrats that each party can put in an A4 page and the Australian Electoral Commission can send that out. Can honourable senators imagine what an administrative mess-up that would be. I will lay London to a brick that it cannot be done for less than $1.60 a page.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cost of political advertising is the price we pay for tuition on the issues. It is true that we put out some stupid advertisements that are not very informative. It is equally true that the Government does that, as do the Democrats. There is something else that is equally true too; that is, the electorate is not stupid and it will judge us. It will judge my Party, the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats by their advertisements. The electors will say amongst themselves, `That is a stupid ad and it doesn't promise anything. They haven't given a clear indication of what they'll do there', and they will make their own assessment.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not appropriate for us to say that we can in some way define what should go into political advertisements and what should not. The reason for the motivation of the Democrats is that they think they are somehow a catcher in the rye that will save this poor ignorant electorate from doing what it will. The mistake they make is assuming that the electorate is ignorant; it is not. A free market in political advertisements is fine by me. I have absolute confidence in the electorate to make its choice.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many more things I would like to say. I conclude by saying that I think it is a disgraceful exercise for the Democrats to say that in some way they are now coming to a position that they have always held. They are coming to a position that they have been pushed into by their internal squabbles. They had plenty of opportunities at the end of the last session to come to this position and did not. They have been pushed into it now and they are trying to squirm around and say they are somehow at the forefront of this debate when what they should have agreed to in the beginning was this trojan horse of a Bill being split into two. They had that opportunity and rejected it.

        Senator McLean can sit and point as much as he likes tonight, spread his arms apart and say, `Do it now, let's do it now', like he is some evangelist. It will not work. The facts of the matter are that the Democrats had this chance before and they neglected it. Their hands have been dirtied and they stay dirtied.

        However, the Democrats appear to be quite willing to acquiesce in this matter. I can only say that there seems to be some sense coming out of Queensland when the President of the Democrats in Queensland decided that the leadership of the Democrats on this issue was so poor that the Leader needed to be removed. I am informed veritably today that not only have the 100 signatures needed to cause a spill in the Democrats been obtained, but also that 200 signatures have been obtained and they have already been dispatched. So the spill is on. Some sense has been brought to bear on a party which has purported to say that it wants to keep the bastards honest, but the difference is that there was a need to find somebody else to keep those bastards honest.

        As a result of all those machinations, as a result of the breakdown in the covert deals that were done between the ALP and the Democrats, I would like to see-and Senator McLean is constantly calling for full disclosure-the full disclosure of any deals that were done to give the Democrats extra staff, or extra this, or extra that. Those deals never see the light of day. The Democrats have many more staff than the rest of us put together. I would like to know the terms and conditions of those extra staff, the dates on which they were given them and how the Democrats voted on the day before they were given them.

        Let me go to the actual terms and the recitals in the motion that we are debating tonight. We in the Opposition support the reference of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill to a committee. What I do not and cannot agree with is the inference in the recitals that are set out as part of this motion. I would like to see the three recitals set out in the first item of the proposed motion replaced with the following recitals. The new motion would say: firstly, `noting that the ALP is a poor manager of its own finances and overspent at the last election, resulting in its present level of debt'; secondly, `noting the ALP's unpopularity with the electorate and its leadership crisis means that it will be unable to attract donations to repay the debt and to finance the next campaign'; thirdly, `noting the Government's hypocrisy in its back-down to this compromise, limited ban'-that is, that there can somehow be freedom of speech up to an election being called but not after it is called- `and that the ALP has chosen to spend its money on direct mail, which is to remain untouched'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I did hear one of the Government speakers earlier in the day talk about the fact that in the United States-or perhaps it was the United Kingdom-there was curtailment of some expenditure. However, the speaker failed to say that the United States has moved to restrict the amount of money that is spent on direct mail because of the ability to manipulate the electorate. If we put that together with the fact that in this country we have compulsory voting, direct mail has a much more potent effect because we know that people must turn out to vote, that we do not have to go out and collect them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fourth point in the amended recital would say, `noting the hypocrisy of the Government in arriving at this back-down position'. That is particularly pertinent when we note statements by Senator Gareth Evans when he was dealing with the crisis in our relationship with Malaysia that in Australia we would not interfere with the right of a playwright to have his play, which was insulting to a foreign neighbour, namely Malaysia, broadcast on national television. However, at the same time Senator Evans and the rest of the Government were contemplating banning forever the right of all Australians to express their political views and to have them broadcast on radio and television in their own country. What hypocrisy can that be?
       </para>
       <para>
        If we replace the recitals in the current motion with those recitals, I think we might get a clearer reason as to why this matter is in fact being referred to a committee. Whilst we are looking at the matters that will be referred, it is quite important to look at the other information that has been circulated by the Government today entitled `Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991: Amendments to be moved on behalf of the Government'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier today, one of the Opposition speakers pointed out that indeed the original drafting of the Bill was sufficiently deficient that it was required to move further amendments to make it explicit as to who may and who may not have a view aired. It is most interesting to note the definitions section. In the original Bill-that is, the one banning political free speech for ever-an election was defined to include by-elections. It is most significant to note that the amendment proposed by the Government specifically says that an election does not include a by-election. Presumably, we have the situation that in the Government's view the electorate is able to cope with advertisements on radio and television in a by-election period but is quite unable to cope with them during a normal election period. Again, there is total inconsistency in the Government's argument on these issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very simply, it is important to point out the duplicity in portraying the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune as being totally supportive of the Government's point of view, as the Government tries to do in the recitals contained in the motion. It is important to note that in its report the Committee reported at paragraph 9.8:
       </para>
       <para>
        While some viewers may support a complete ban on political advertising it would have a direct effect on freedom of speech by reducing opportunities for discussion during election periods when voters are determining the candidate or party they wish to support.

        . . . . . . . . .

        Most witnesses disagreed with a complete ban on political advertising, claiming that it would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech and in particular would disadvantage citizens and groups who wished to bring issues before the electorate. The beneficiaries of a complete ban would be the existing major parties.

        Mr Burdekin, of whom we have heard quite an amount, in dealing with how this would restrict a right that is enshrined in an international declaration, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The important point from a human rights perspective (and this is a well developed concept elsewhere-for example in United States jurisprudence on freedom of expression) is the danger of accepting government or government agencies as the arbiters of truth and falsity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet in this country under this proposed legislation it would be the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-headed by a former Labor Party apparatchik who, no matter how well he performs his task, will be seen to be a former Labor Party apparatchik-which would determine, because of the way the legislation is drafted, whether a television or radio station continued to keep its licence. In other words, shareholders' investments, and wages and jobs, are placed in jeopardy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have had a whole debate tonight about the jobs of some people who have been working in a dining room under various work practices. What about the jobs that would be placed in jeopardy if a television or radio licence were cancelled because a broadcaster put to air something which a former apparatchik of the Labor Party finally decided was a political advertisement? What an outrageous situation! Mr Burdekin went on to say:

       <para>
        An equally important corollary-

        In this day of the electronic media honourable senators can speak to each other across this chamber. But we know that when the proceedings are being broadcast, as they are today, we will reach a very large audience, and we will reach it without having to get to it by interpretation of the people who normally sit in the press gallery and put their slant on how they think anybody has performed. In other words, we are able to speak directly to the people who elect us. Yet the whole purpose of this Bill is to stop that right to communicate and speak directly to the people who will have the right to choose between competing ideas.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are looking at an important watershed issue. The Labor Party lost the attempt to ban freedom of speech absolutely because sensible members of the Democrats put pressure on their organisation to sack their Leader because she was seen to be in cahoots with the Labor Party; they demanded that there be a fresh leader who would at least uphold some of their principles. At the very root of this Bill is the question of what is right and what is wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of disclosure, it becomes a very emotional event. We on this side of the House have said that we are in support of fair and equitable disclosure. That means it falls evenly on all parties; that there should be no favours for the trade union movement which allow it to act as a warehousing operation; that there be no little loophole through which the Government can clip its extra dollars, if it ever manages to attract them again. The point at issue is simply that there are some people who argue that it is part of their freedom of expression to make a donation to a political party of their choice. They find that being told their amount must be disclosed is akin to being told that they must disclose any donation they make to a charity or to a religion. Indeed, it might be said to be akin to saying, `How much do you put on the plate in the church?'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nonetheless, there has been a commitment given on this side of the House to support full, fair and equitable disclosure which is not biased and not slanted. That is why it is important that the entire Bill in its present form be sent to the committee for discussion and examination. The bottom line is that one cannot legislate for integrity. No amount of legislation will prevent the grubby revelations that we are seeing with the golden-shoe brigade appearing daily before the WA Inc. royal commission.

         —I find myself in support of what I believe to be the very important piece of legislation before the Senate. I am disappointed that we cannot proceed to deal with it at this time and I am disappointed that it is going to a committee. I hope that at the end of this committee's deliberations we will see some genuine reform in this area, which is most important for our nation. What has happened in the last few weeks is that divisions within the Australian Democrats have somewhat derailed the processes of this legislation, but that does not alter the fact that it is a package of proposals of fundamental importance to this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        These proposals and this legislation will remove the influence of money from the Australian political system. They will get rid of the sleaze factor in Australian politics. We have heard of some selective areas where there have been problems, such as WA Inc., and it is fair enough that the Opposition refer to them. I could go through a whole range of other recent examples in Australian politics. We could talk about the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland; we could talk about the investigation by ICAC in New South Wales into north coast development; we could talk about a royal commission currently occurring in Tasmania; and so it goes on. All those cases prove that there is a need for us to act in this situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real problem that we have is that political parties face enormous costs in Australian election campaigns-all political parties: the Opposition parties, the Labor Party and any other political party that one cares to mention. Many political parties have cut corners because of those costs. There appears to be only one way to deal with this situation, that is, the package of proposals that the Government has brought forward. On the one hand, there is a necessity for us to limit the costs of election campaigns and, on the other hand, there is a need for donations and contributions to political parties to be fully disclosed. If we see that package of proposals in place, then I believe we will go a long way towards dealing with this sleaze factor that has infested Australian politics in recent times.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both full disclosure of political donations and the banning of electronic political advertising have been on Labor's agenda for several years. I am personally sorry that it has taken both so long to appear on our legislative agenda. It is a tragedy, because of the problems we have with the leadership of the Australian Democrats, that there is some serious risk that the original proposals that the Government has put forward will be significantly changed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to have seen these matters addressed very early in the term of this Government, in 1983 or 1984, when Labor was clearly and unambiguously on the ascendant. But the facts of the matter are that the justification for introducing this package of reforms remains as strong now-if not stronger-as it ever was, and all the trends in Australian political campaigning and in the political process in this country over the last several years really have reinforced the need for the sorts of reforms that the Government is proposing.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have heard from the Opposition about free speech. We have heard about it ad nauseam. I must say that it is easy for the Opposition-or anyone else-to score points with cynical and cheap scare tactics about free speech. I do not think many people examine this issue very closely, they naturally react on a superficial level.

         —I received a cable recently from the National Organisation for Women Inc. in Washington. I would like to share with the Senate the contents of this cable and the matters that it is addressing, not because it is a matter of joy but because it is a matter of the greatest gravity.
        </para>

       <para>
        The fax message advises me of a commemoration day-which happens to be today, 13 August-for the senseless violence towards and murder of 19 girls in a boarding school in Kenya. Nineteen girls were murdered and 71 girls were raped by their male schoolmates on 14 July 1991. There has been a call for a worldwide vigil in cooperation with a feminist group, Maendeleo ya Wanawake. That is a Kenya-wide women's organisation based in Nairobi. It has organised this vigil to take place simultaneously in Kenya, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, Ireland and India.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the first page of this message there is a quote from the deputy principal of St Kizito boarding school. The deputy principal is quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        The boys never meant any harm against the girls. They just wanted to rape.
       </para>
       <para>
        I raise this matter in the Senate today, partly as some contribution to the vigil around the world held for this appalling event, partly because I have been a receiver of the hospitality of the Maendeleo ya Wanawake group in Nairobi and, indeed, met some of the representatives of that women's organisation when they visited this country-and partly because I think an issue of this gravity is something that the world ought to think about. Certainly its parliaments ought to think about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is reasonable and, indeed, responsible for Australia to raise this because violence against women is not something raised for the first time by me tonight. It is something that many people have spoken about in this chamber over some time. I do not believe I could draw much distinction between any honourable senators in this place in their united view of opposition to violence against women in this society. What I can mention-and I am proud to do so because it deserves mention-is the efforts made by this Government to legitimise the rights of women and to make violence against women illegitimate and illegal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts of that attack in the boarding school in Kenya on 14 July 1991 are not known in any great detail to me, nor are they conveyed in great detail in this article. I am just told that something like 300 boys from the boarding school in Meru, Kenya, brutally attacked their female classmates. The cable read as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        In a planned attack, the boys cut the telephone and electricity lines and then invaded the dormitory in which all the girls had hidden in fear of an attack. 19 girls lost their lives in the chaos which followed, most likely due to trampling as the terrified girls ran for safety.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsequent reports suggest that most of the girls died of asphyxiation because they were crushed one on top of the other and were unable to breathe. It says in the cable that they may have been trampled but, in fact, the subsequent medical reports suggested that they were asphyxiated. The cable continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Over 100 were injured, and 71 raped. It was, said one survivor, ``like being attacked by a pack of hungry hyenas, except the boys outside our dormitory that night were more terrifying''. Police arrived hours late, ignoring calls for investigation. Kenyan president Arap Moi, moved to tears by the site of destruction, described what happened as the ``most ugly'' incident he had ever encountered in his life.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is certainly true that many Kenyans were absolutely shocked by this appalling event, as were women across the world. When I read that story, I suffered the dropping away feeling in my stomach that yet again we have this kind of violence against women. This case related to girls in a boarding school, a place where one might have thought that we could expect our girls to feel safe. Maendeleo ya Wanawake wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        The boys received legitimization for their brutal acts from the subjugation of women present in Kenyan society as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is its comment, not mine. There are a number of comments which elaborate on that point contained in the associated material which came with this message. There are articles which I think are from the New York Times which address this evil. One such article, written by Jane Perlez, is headed `The Evil Men Do To Women in Kenya'. It appears to have been published on 8 April 1991, which is a bit exciting if the event did not happen until July. So I would have to say that I am not quite sure of the facts of that matter. The article refers to the St Kizito incident, so I must have some information here wrong. The article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        An educational comic strip in the booklet makes the point that beating is not a symbol of love, as many women believe.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article mentions a number of the points that have been raised in this place, I think more by the women than the men. That is not necessarily a criticism of men; it is just a comment that these are the sorts of attitudes that women in this place have brought to the attention of the Senate and, hopefully, a wider audience than just the Senate. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``I think the boys are as much a victim as the girls,'' said Wanjika Mwoita, who until two years ago was a lecturer in French at Nairobi University.
       </para>
       <para>
        ``I'm sure these boys did not set out to kill,'' she said. ``They've been socialised to believe that if you want to get sex, you get it and that if you want anything there is no way a woman is going to stand in the way. They have been taught to believe that girls are to be used.''
       </para>
       <para>
        I have only put some of the quotes from the material given to me into the record tonight, because they actually say the same thing again and again. I mention again the massive depression that I felt on hearing this news. I sometimes get the feeling that we are not learning and that the crimes against women and girls do not cease.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not very long ago that we heard of the massacre of female students I think in a Canadian university. There was a call at that time for another worldwide vigil because of the violence committed against women. I think that it is a matter of the gravest depression. I do think that we have to hope that we can change this situation, but I sometimes feel that it may take so long that we will not notice any signs of change.
       </para>
       <para>
        In case I was forgetting this situation and feeling a little optimistic, I opened the Melbourne Age on 9 August this year and read the headline, `Rape trauma less for prostitute says judge'. The article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        A County Court judge who yesterday jailed a man for rape said the gravity of the crime was lessened because the victim was a prostitute.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a newspaper report, not a full account of the court report. I do not think that we should leap to a judgment against the judge, which this headline might lead us to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one reads the article more closely, I believe one can say that the judge deserves our sternest concern. According to this report-and perhaps it is not as bad as the headline might have led me to believe-the judge said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . because prostitutes were involved in sex as a business, rape was likely to cause them less psychological harm than other women.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have to say to the judge, with respect, that that is to miss the point, let alone to miss the facts or the psychological concerns of prostitution. Whether a person is a prostitute ought to have no place at all in assessing whether a person is guilty of rape, or in making some assessment of the punishment for the crime of rape. One wonders what the judge might conclude about rape in marriage. My mind boggles to think of the logic he would go to. If he argues about prostitution being somehow a capacity to reduce the crime of rape against a prostitute, what would that learned judge have to say about rape in marriage?
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say that I am very concerned to find that such attitudes still occur in learned and senior people in the society in which I live. I mentioned the story of the Kenyan women's violation as part of the worldwide acknowledgment on this day of mourning the senseless violence against them, and also to say that I do not take too much comfort sometimes from the attitudes we see reflected in our own society. I would hope that the attitudes which allow violence against women as the norm will go.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is critical that the Senate-not only its women but also its men-make it absolutely clear that violence against women in this society, or in any other society, is absolutely not on. It is totally unacceptable to in any way perpetuate the myth that women are somehow deserving of being beaten, that they are somehow lesser mortals, that they are creatures of burden or creatures of subjugation. That is not what our society says about women. The Senate needs to reflect that both in its legislation and in its attitudes.

        Honourable senators are well aware of the fact that I have used the adjournment debate, I believe very effectively, to pursue the issue of banking malpractice and corrupt practices. Honourable senators will probably be a little alarmed to learn that I intend to continue to use it quite extensively in this session. I believe that what has been achieved in the last 2 1/2 years is a sensitising of the Australian community to bank practice, and I think it is appropriate that we move beyond the stage of sensitising the community to actually demanding and ensuring that action occur in relation to the issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure that honourable senators will recall the drama in this place, let alone outside it, surrounding the Westpac letters. I have continued to pursue the question of the Westpac letters, which I believe provided prima facie evidence of fraud, conspiracy and a number of other very serious crimes. I have in fact written to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) asking how and when they will pursue the revelations of criminal activity which were exposed so effectively by the Westpac letters.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have received a reply from the Treasurer who, in a very brief letter, drew my attention to the fact that the matter really belongs with the Attorney-General. I have received a reply from the Attorney-General telling me that the matter belongs with the Australian Federal Police and that he has referred certain aspects of it to the Federal Police. With respect to that body, I draw attention to the fact that there was a dual allegation advanced by me in this place, and that is that the Federal Police in the past have been less than diligent in their pursuit of these allegations of fraud in relation to bank issues. So I must admit to having some lack of confidence that there will be speed or effectiveness. Sadly, I say that of the Federal Police in relation to these matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General also draws my attention to the fact that he has referred the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions and that the responsibility lies with State law enforcement agencies. Frankly, I am not particularly encouraged by the response from the Attorney-General to think that there will be any major thrust concerning the important aspects in relation to bank fraud which are clearly revealed in the Westpac letters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General also refers me to the fact that the review of the Australian financial system by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the Martin committee, is still proceeding with its hearings. I think the Martin committee now rightly deserves the reputation of being a soft committee. I do not expect that it will seriously address the tough issues inherent in banking. I believe it will deliver to the Parliament a soft report with recommendations which step around the real matters. I would be delighted to be proven wrong on that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have gone around the country in the last few months since my appearance before the Martin committee on 15 March. Putting it bluntly, by my assessment, the way in which my evidence was treated by that inquiry, which encouraged people to appear before it, was a mere farce. It was simply through making honest statements that I had a bad experience before that Committee and I do not have a lot of confidence in it. I have been asked to appear before it again, and I will be doing so in the hope that, slowly but surely, the Committee is toughening its position in relation to the sorts of issues that I have placed before it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent days we have again seen the question of foreign currency loans raised before the Martin committee. There has been a suggestion that there are confidential Commonwealth Bank documents-internal memos-which clearly and openly admit negligence on the part of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to foreign currency loans. One can assess where this negligence sits only by what we have been able to gather from the press, because Mr Martin and his committee have not insisted that the Commonwealth Bank table those documents. In fact, that is a source of some grave concern to those of us who have followed this issue from the beginning, and who have followed the inquiry since its beginning. We are amazed that after three months Mr Martin is not insisting that the Committee has access to those documents.
       </para>
       <para>
        As recently as yesterday we have received a declaration by the Commonwealth Bank that it is continuing to pursue precisely the practices in relation to foreign currency loans that it had referred to as being flawed and inadequate in the confidential documents which the Martin committee has failed to demand. I believe that this inadequacy on the part of the Martin committee clearly indicates its lack of moral courage and its lack of fortitude and will in relation to this tough issue. I have no confidence that it is going to put any significant pressure upon any bank in relation to any significant act of corruption or malpractice. Indeed, as I have just said, we see the Commonwealth Bank flouting the Committee by saying that it will proceed to continue with precisely the same practices in relation to foreign currency loans.

Even Sir Ninian Stephen and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of a State have said that in these respects ordinary Australians get shoddy treatment from the judicial system.

        Any of us who have read the Westpac letters would be absolutely dismayed to read the latest issue of the Westpac magazine, Issues. I have the last issue-Volume 13, July-August 1991-in front of me. There is an article entitled `Into Professional Forex Market'. In the preface to the article, Westpac says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Up to now, only banks or large corporations had direct access to the professional foreign exchange market. Now a new Westpac service opens this market to a wide range of players.
       </para>
       <para>
        Westpac is now starting to promote yet again the very process which was exposed as fraudulent and corrupt in the Westpac letters. Under a subtitle the article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Each day we revalue each position against a current market exchange rate and unrealised profit or loss will arise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anybody who has read the Westpac letters will acknowledge this as being absolute mockery. It is a diabolical affront to the Australian populace that Westpac would now advocate itself as a professional manager on the foreign exchange market when clearly the Westpac letters provide evidence that it took points, switched deals, acted fraudulently, abandoned the fiduciary obligations of its clients, evaded tax and stepped outside its statutory obligations to a gutless Reserve Bank that has not challenged Westpac concerning the serious allegations contained in the Westpac letters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sadly, we must continue this task of pursuing bank malpractice and corrupt practices. I do not believe that the Treasurer of this country will do so on our behalf or that the Attorney-General has the will to do so on our behalf. I reluctantly have doubts as to whether the Federal Police has the will or the resources to do so on our behalf. Already the banks are simply defying the activities of the Martin Committee, flying in the face of the parliamentary inquiry into banking practice in this country. Most Australians, like me, would be alarmed that we now discover that the Australian Bankers Association, the peak organisation of bankers in this country, has employed at its own expense a consultant who has sat cheek by jowl as adviser to the banking inquiry for the last few months. So we have rampant malpractice. I use those words quite advisedly because I believe that is the magnitude of the problem. I believe that we have shown only the tip of the iceberg to date in this respect, and I believe it is my duty and the duty of others to continue to pursue the matter.

In that question she asked for details of the structure of the committee to conduct the inquiry and, in particular, she raised the point of why was it not a joint committee of the Parliament with representatives of both Houses but only a House of Representatives committee. In that question she made the following remarks:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Is it not true that Senators Childs and Schacht are keen to serve on this committee and obviously do not consider themselves to be too overloaded?
       </para>
       <para>
        On 7 August, in a couple of comments made to the press by Senator Powell, the Leader of the Democrats, similar implications were made that the Government was putting this inquiry to a House of Representatives committee only because it did not want either myself or Senator Childs-who have shown considerable interest in the concentration of print media ownership in Australia-to be involved in any joint committee because of our interest, and because we may be more willing than members of the House of Representatives to ask tough questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to put the record straight. I was consulted by Mr Beazley in early August and took part in a discussion with him about the structure of this media inquiry. I was involved in that discussion because I was the first person to raise within the Labor Party, some three and a quarter years ago, the need to have an inquiry into the structure of print media ownership in Australia. The need for such an inquiry has been a long campaign on behalf of myself and several others-including Senator Childs-within the parliamentary Labor Party and the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know there were many doubting Thomases in the media and elsewhere who never believed that such an inquiry would take place. I am certainly very pleased that, as a result of a resolution carried at the National Conference of the Labor Party in Hobart in late June this year, the Government agreed to conduct such an inquiry with broad and comprehensive terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        Initially, two or three years ago, I asked for the inquiry to be conducted by the Trade Practices Commission, but I am more than happy to support a parliamentary committee. Such a committee would have broader powers to seek evidence than the Trade Practices Commission and obviously that would be very useful to the committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as whether it should be a joint parliamentary committee or a House of Representatives committee, I do not deny that if all other things were equal I would be more than interested in serving on a parliamentary inquiry into print media ownership in Australia because of my long interest in this issue. However, all things are not equal and looking at the workload of the Senate, through both its standing committees and the ever-increasing proliferation of select committees-many of them being established, I must say, at the request and instigation of the Australian Democrats as a way for the Government to proceed to get some agreement on its legislative program-it is becoming very difficult for back bench members of the Government in this place to be able to serve effectively on all the committees that have now been established. I must say that, even had the joint committee been established, I do not know whether I would have been able to serve on it, in view of my workload as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and as a member of other standing committees of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore I was agreeable to, and accepted, the suggestion made by the Minister that the most efficient way for this inquiry to be conducted quickly was through a committee of the House of Representatives. I accepted that view without being subject to any pressure at all and I am more than confident that there are plenty of people in the House of Representatives-on both sides of the Parliament-who will be able to make a very worthwhile contribution to that inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note also that the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, has indicated that there will be a deadline at the end of the year for that committee to report so that, if the Government needs to consider amendments to legislation as a result of any findings of this House of Representatives select committee, it can do so in the autumn session of parliament next year. I believe that the timetable for legislation is a much more important consideration than any personal view that one may have about satisfying one's own interests by serving on a joint committee. I believe that the suggestions made by Senator Kernot, Senator Powell and other Australian Democrats in recent days-that the establishment of a House of Representatives committee is a whitewash-are utterly false. This committee will not be a whitewash; the Government members of the House of Representatives who I know are interested in serving on the committee have certainly indicated that they will not be on that committee to make a whitewash of the issue. They are very keen for the committee to bring down some worthwhile recommendations after a properly conducted public inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I believe that in the past twelve months there has been a considerable increase in public concern about the media situation-particularly about the print media-in Australia. Much of that concern has been driven by the collapse of the Fairfax empire and speculation about potential bidders for the Fairfax Press. Obviously the terms of reference as outlined by the Minister for Transport and Communications do not specifically mention the Fairfax Press, but they are certainly broad enough to cover issues relating to its future. I am sure members of the Australian community will take the opportunity to put their views forward to the committee. I also hope that the Australian Journalists Association and other groups associated with the media, which have argued for such an inquiry for a long time, take this opportunity to put their views forward and to create a broader community debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been some suggestion that people in the industry itself, because of its already very high concentration of ownership, will be a bit nervous about putting forward their views about the way in which it is presently operating. I hope that is not true. The Committee will be hearing evidence with all of the privileges of the Parliament and of course it can conduct hearings in camera where necessary. I hope that all of those people who in the past have complained privately about the operation of the media in Australia do use this opportunity-which I think is a unique one-which the Government has now given to the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I look forward to the inquiry being conducted. I look forward to its recommendations and, if the recommendations of the Committee of inquiry mean legislative change, I hope that the Government can act accordingly in the Autumn session.

       The capital adequacy guidelines were introduced in 1988, but the Reserve Bank permitted transitional arrangements for some Australian banks until June 1990. These allowed banks not initially meeting the minimum ratio of 8 per cent time to do so. (The international Basle guidelines allow for transition periods up to end 1992). Since June 1990, all banks have been required to operate in excess of the minimum ratio. When a bank has come close to breaching this ratio, prompt corrective action has been taken by the bank concerned, under the guidance of the Reserve Bank.
      </para>
      <para>
       These arrangements apply to State banks and to the trustee bank in Tasmania.

       (1) Section 6 (1) of the Banking Act provides that nothing in Parts II or V, or in Sections 61 to 69 (inclusive), of the Act applies with respect to State banking. Parts III, IV and VI of the Act, which are not covered by these exclusions, are concerned with:
      </para>
      <para>
       Part III Foreign Exchange, Foreign Investment, etc, including the authority to deal in foreign exchange;
      </para>

      <para>
       Part VI Collection and publication of information about banks;
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) Part II (Provisions Relating to the Carrying on of Banking Business) of the Banking Act does not apply to State banks, ie a State bank does not require authorisation under that Part of the Banking Act to conduct banking business, is not subject to the provisions relating to prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank and is not covered by the Protection of Depositor provisions. However, by agreement between the Reserve Bank and the Board of each State Bank, State banks have undertaken voluntarily to comply with Reserve Bank prudential requirements. This means that, for practical purposes, in its supervision the Reserve Bank makes no distinction between State banks and banks authorised under the Banking Act. The Treasurer is aware of these voluntary arrangements but is not part of them.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the Reserve Bank were to become aware of a problem in a State bank, it would press the management and Board of the bank to clarify the nature and extent of the difficulty and to put in place strategies to maintain the viability of the bank, protect its depositors and deal with the problem. If the problem was judged severe enough to threaten the viability of the bank concerned, the Reserve Bank would normally seek to discuss its views with the State Government concerned. At this point, the powers and responsibilities of the Reserve Bank are quite different in respect of a State Bank than they would be in respect of a Banking Act bank in similar circumstances. If a bank authorised under the Banking Act was in serious difficulty, the Reserve Bank could assume control of the bank and manage it in the interests of depositors.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Very substantial progress has been made in the development of the Code of Conduct.  A draft Code has been prepared and was issued by the Privacy Commissioner on 5 June 1991 for public comment.  Subsection 18A(2) of the Privacy Act 1988, as amended by the Privacy Amendment Act 1990, requires consultation with government, commercial, consumer and other relevant organisations before issuing the Code.  To this end, a draft Code of Conduct was drawn up at a series of meetings convened by the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, during March, April and May 1991. The Code of Conduct will come into effect upon the commencement of the Privacy Amendment Act. It is expected that this will occur on 24 September 1991 which is the latest possible date for commencement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The bodies and organisations which were involved in the preparation of the draft Code are: Australian Finance Conference; Retail Traders Association of Australia; Australian Federation of Credit Unions; Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies; Australian Bankers' Association; Credit Reference Association of Australia Limited; New South Wales Privacy Committee; the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association.  Officers from the Attorney-General's Department's Justice Division and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs have attended the consultation meetings in advisory and observer roles.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Privacy Act, as amended, provides, at section 18J, that credit reporting agencies, such as the Credit Reference Association of Australia, must take reasonable steps by way of appropriate corrections, deletions and additions to ensure that personal information contained in a credit information file or a credit report to ensure that the file or report is accurate, up-to-date, complete and not misleading. The Code will seek to ensure that credit reporting agencies will make publicly known procedures by which access by individuals to their own credit information files may be obtained and amendments to the information contained therein may be made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) Individual subjects of credit reporting agencies' files will at all times have a right of access to their own files. There is no legal impediment to subjects being sent copies of their files. However, there is also no power under any law to require this to be done.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) I am advised by the CRAA that its existing practices ensure, as far as practicable, the accuracy of its data.  Individuals have always been made aware of their right of access to their own files and to advise of errors.  I am also advised that credit providers using CRAA under a voluntary code, which predates the Privacy Amendment Act 1990, automatically advise individuals who have been refused credit because of a CRAA file of their right to contact CRAA and request a copy of that file.  I understand that approximately 35,000 individuals a year already make use of this means of access to their files.

       With reference to the fact that s.7 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 gives approval to the ratification by Australia of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, but that there is no similar provision in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, does the Government intend to submit a Bill to Parliament with the aim of removing the limitations contained in both s.6(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986, which presently `does not bind the Crown in right of a State' and s.6(2) of the same Act; if so when.

      <para>
       Section 7 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 gives approval to ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  Australia ratified that Convention on 30 September 1975.  No such provision was necessary in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986; Australia had already ratified, on 13 August 1980, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  This convention is a schedule to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       On ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Australia lodged a declaration in the following terms:
      </para>
      <para>
       `Australia has a federal constitutional system in which legislative, executive and judicial powers are shared or distributed between the Commonwealth and the constituent States.  The implementation of the treaty throughout Australia will be effected by the Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities having regard to their constitutional powers and arrangements concerning their exercise.'
      </para>
      <para>
       A federal statement such as this does not affect Australia's obligations as a party to the Covenant.  It draws attention to the division of powers under the federal system and indicates that the States also have a role in the implementation of the Covenant's obligations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia reports to the United Nations at regular intervals on the measures taken to give effect to the rights recognised in the Covenant.  These reports include information on the measures taken by State governments to implement obligations under the Covenant.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has no plans to amend subsection 6(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to bind the Crown in right of the States.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second issue raised by the honourable senator concerns subsection 6(2) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act.  The subsection provides that the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, or a State, or Norfolk Island, shall not be liable to be prosecuted for an offence under the Act.  A similar provision also appears in the Racial Discrimination Act.  This is in accordance with the policy and practice applying to Commonwealth legislation, that criminal liability is not imposed on the Crown.

        —-The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1)-(7) The current hospital funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories were introduced in 1988. The Commonwealth Hospital Funding Grants contain a specific component (the Medicare Incentives Package--MIP) which provides grants to the States/Territories for the development of innovative projects aimed at improving the efficiency of public hospitals by substituting in-hospital effort with day surgery, post acute early discharge and palliative care programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The MIP component is indexed annually in the same manner as the general Hospital Funding Grant--that is, for prices and award wages increases in line with national economic indicators and real growth based on age and sex-weighted annual population growth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each year MIP funding is nominally allocated to the States/Territories on a per capita basis weighted to take account of age/sex distribution profiles. Each State/Territory Health Minister distributes the funds to individual projects in accordance with local priorities but within agreed broad priority areas. Accordingly the proportion of MIP funding devoted to palliative care varies from year to year and between States/Territories.
      </para>
      <para>
       The MIP arrangements were discussed with State/Territory health authorities and agreed by Health Ministers and the Premiers before their introduction. Ongoing discussions occur at officer level on individual projects and priorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The role of the Commonwealth in regard to palliative care relates to funding rather than service delivery.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The Home and Community Care (HACC) Program makes available home help and home nursing services to people who are dying. HACC growth funds, however, are not available for specific palliative care services.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, the Medicare Incentive Packages also assist those requiring palliative care. The packages are expected to cover the needs of palliative care patients, including nursing, physiotherapy, and home help services. Co-ordination is provided by the funded hospital/nursing service.
      </para>
      <para>
       Funding is also included under MIP for contributions towards the cost of treatment and care in hospital of people with AIDS.
      </para>
      <para>
       The AIDS Matched Funding Program is cost- shared between the Commonwealth and States and Territories. Responsibility for the provision of services rests with the States/Territories. Under the agreed Program activities, funding may be directed to the provision of home care services and hospice services for people with HIV as well as self help and care programs developed by community-based organisations for people with HIV, including their carers. In addition, the Program provides training to actual or prospective professional and volunteer care-givers of people with HIV/AIDS.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Nil.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) The Medicare Benefits Schedule lists the various medical services for which Medicare benefits are attracted when rendered by medical practitioners to patients: (a) at home; (b) in hospices; (c) in hospitals; and (d) in nursing homes. Medicare benefits are not payable in respect of services rendered by nurses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare benefits are payable at the rate of 85 per cent of the Schedule fee listed in the Medicare Benefits Schedule for out-of-hospital services with a maximum payment by the patient of S26 for each service where the Schedule fee is charged (where the doctor direct-bills the Government for services rendered there is no charge to the patient). However, where a doctor charges above the Schedule fee, the patient is responsible for any amount in excess of the Schedule fee in addition to the 15 per cent/$26 `patient gap'.
      </para>
      <para>
       For out-of-hospital services Medicare has a $240 `safety net' for patients needing continuous medical treatment. Where an individual incurs expenditure on `gaps' (the difference between the Medicare benefit and Schedule fee) equal to $240 in any one financial year, Medicare will meet 100 per cent of the Schedule fee for medical expenses incurred for out-of-hospital services during the remainder of the year.
      </para>
      <para>
       For services to private patients in hospitals and day hospital facilities, Medicare benefits are paid at 75 per cent of the Schedule fee, with private health insurance funds being required to pay the gap between the benefit and the Schedule fee for insured patients.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Medicare arrangements Australian residents are eligible for free treatment in public hospitals (including out-patient treatment) as public patients, and the Federal Government provides considerable funding to the States/Territories for health purposes to ensure availability of, and access to, such treatment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Pain killing narcotic analgesic drugs are available to the dying at home, in hospices, in hospitals and in nursing homes at the discretion of the medical practitioner.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) The cost of such drugs to the patients in State run institutions is the responsibility of the State Government. The cost of those narcotic analgesics which are Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) items is subsidised by the Commonwealth whether at home, in a hospice, a private hospital or a nursing home.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) The supply of narcotic analgesics which are PBS items is subject to restrictions recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits stipulates the maximum quantity that may be supplied on one prescription. They may be prescribed in cases where there is present severe disabling pain not responding to non-narcotic analgesics. Authorities for increased maximum quantities and/or repeats will be granted subject to any restrictions stated in the Schedule of Benefits. The administered dose is at the discretion of the medical practitioner. The persons who may administer the medication to the patient is a matter of State law.

       (1) No grants have been made to the ACTU subsequent and in addition to those advised in response to Question on Notice No 242. However, in response to a request from an executive of the ACTU, the Minister for Resources agreed to reimburse the three union members on the Consultative Committee on Safety in the Offshore Petroleum Industry (COSOP), 50 per cent of the cost of their return airfares to Perth, for the purpose of attending the 30 April-1 May 1991 meeting of the committee. The ACTU members of the COSOP committee have claimed reimbursement of $824 and the claim was processed for payment on 28 May 1991. Similarly, unions affiliated with the ACTU which are participating in the Government's Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) Strategy process have been reimbursed travel and accommodation expenses on the same basis as other non-government organisations participating in the process.

       (2) No further grants are anticipated in financial year 1991-92;  however, reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses will continue throughout the duration of the ESD Strategy process which is due to be completed in October 1991.

        —-The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) to (5) It is not the Department's accounting practice to separately identify expenditure for the hire of artificial and natural plants and the purchase or maintenance of same, rather all associated costs are charged to one expenditure item. The Department uses pot plants to make its client services areas more attractive, as well as enhancing the work environment for staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department's total expenditure for the hire, purchase and maintenance of artificial and natural plants is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       1987-88--$36,900.00
      </para>
      <para>
       1988-89--$51,162.79

      <para>
       1989-90--$71,660.59
      </para>
      <para>
       Much of the increase in the Department's expenditure on these items from 1987-88 to 1989- 90 can be attributed to the refurbishment and upgrade during this period of the Department's existing public contact areas, the opening of 4 additional regional offices, and the establishment of 8 Migration Internal Review Offices.

       The account for $1,779.87 included amounts for station provisions, cargo operations and field groups. While other voyages included some of these items no other voyage included all of these items.

       Earlier this month, I met with the Federal member for Lalor the Hon.

As I announced on 30 May, the RAAF pilot training system will be restructured to involve civilian flight screening and all through PC-9 training at Pearce.  Consequently, No. 1 Flying Training School at Point Cook will be disbanded and the CT-4 aircraft retired, probably about the end of 1992.

      <para>
       The Department does not earmark specific numbers of places for people with disabilities within its labour market programs. It does however articulate target groups for its labour market programs, and people with disabilities form one such target group. The policy of the Department is to encourage people from the various target groups to participate in labour market programs at a level which reflects their representation amongst unemployed people. At present it is accepted that people with disabilities form 12.2 per cent of the total unemployed population (Australian Bureau of Statistics--Disabled and Aged Persons Survey 1988). The following information is provided about the number of people with disabilities accessing labour market assistance programs:-
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the Australian Traineeship System (ATS)-- the ATS has a target of 15 per cent of all commencements for people from disadvantaged groups (of which people with disabilities is one group). In the period August 1985--April 1991, people with disabilities formed 2 per cent of total ATS participants. This represents:

       SkillShare--In 1990 8.9 per cent (9,063) of SkillShare participants were people with disabilities. It is expected that there will be a substantial increase in the number of people with disabilities assisted under SkillShare in 1991 as a result of a number of enhancements to the program which relate to people with disabilities. These include:

       The article in The Age referred to above, mentions a research team involving Professor H Burger. Professor Burger and others have received departmental funding through the National Health and Medical Research area for several years for inhibin research. My Department has approached Professor Burger to seek more information on the status of the use of testing for inhibin levels in blood in the diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer. At present, no Medicare benefit is available for blood tests to detect inhibin. Whether a Medicare benefit should be available for the diagnostic tests used to detect inhibin for Australian women in the `high risk' category is a matter on which the Minister would take the expert advice of the Pathology Services Table Committee. The reasons for taking that advice include being sure that such tests have passed the stage of clinical trials and are in fact a worthwhile diagnostic test.

       (1) Yes. With regard to the flight on 16 December 1989, a RAAF aircraft flew Mr Costello and Mr McCready (Counsellor, Australian Embassy, Bangkok) from Phnom Pehn to Bangkok.  Original plans for travel by car from Phnom Pehn to Ho Chi Minh City and then by Commercial flight to Bangkok had to be changed because of positive developments regarding advancement of Australia's peace initiative on Cambodia.  At that time no commercial air service between Phnom Pehn and Bangkok existed.  The use of RAAF aircraft was necessary to enable Mr Costello to catch a commercial flight out of Bangkok on 16 December 1989 to keep vital appointments in Beijing.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to the RAAF aircraft flights from 27 April to 2 May 1990, the rapid emergence of prospects of a breakthrough in negotiations initiated by Australia regarding a cessation of hostilities in Cambodia required urgent and reliable travel arrangements for discussions with the Cambodian parties and regional governments.  An examination of commercial services at the time showed that these were either not available, or, where services did exist, they were infrequent, unreliable and over-booked, and reliance on them would have made impossible rapid movement between major players to further negotiations on a ceasefire.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The purpose of the visit was to hold discussions with the Cambodian parties and with regional countries in relation to Australia's peace initiative on Cambodia.  Passengers accompanying Mr Costello were:

The actual costs of drug abuse treatment which is provided predominantly by the States and Territories, are met from a complex mix of revenue sourced from their own and Federal taxes. A recent attempt has been made to estimate the impact of drug abuse on the Federal Budget by calculating the excess of government outlays on medical, hospital and accommodation services in association with drug treatment over the revenue derived from the taxes and excise on the sale of these drugs and the income tax revenue forgone as a result of drug-induced premature deaths.

       The Department's financial management systems do not allow transport costs to be separated readily by mode of travel. In accordance with the practice of previous Governments, I am not prepared to authorise use of the considerable resources required to assemble this information.

       (1) The possibility that magnetic fields generated by powerlines may be responsible for an increase in cancer incidence is a hypothesis which is receiving consideration among scientists in this country and overseas.
      </para>
      <para>
       This hypothesis rests mainly on five studies that have reported significant associations between the incidence of cancer and exposure to higher than average residential magnetic fields and on studies of subjects suspected of being exposed to magnetic fields due to their employment. Other residential studies have reported inconclusive results, neither confirming nor disproving the suspected association.
      </para>

       A number of laboratory studies have shown that electromagnetic fields are capable of affecting biological processes although the human health implications are unknown.

The organisations listed would also have expressed willingness to be included in such a listing, and would have felt themselves able to offer information relevant to energy use or energy and the environment.  The ACA did not aim to be totally comprehensive--indeed, lack of space prevented this.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Since 1985-86 the year the Home and Community Care (HACC) program was established, the total Commonwealth expenditure in Western Australia under the program comprises:
      </para>
      <para>
       1985-86 $11,417,142
      </para>

      <para>
       1990-91 (Est) $26,910,000
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In the first two years of funding (1985-86 and 1986-87), the Commonwealth and State contributions to the program maintained in real terms the 1984-85 level of funding under the four Acts subsumed by HACC legislation. In addition, the Commonwealth made funds available nationally for new projects and the expansion of existing services.  In 1984-85 $10m was made available nationally by the Commonwealth for this purpose; in 1985-86 $25m (on a $3 Commonwealth-$1 State/Territory basis; and in 1986-87 $30m (on a $2 Commonwealth-$1 State/Territory basis). In all cases any balance could be rolled-over into the succeeding year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since 1987-88, the HACC payments system in each State and Territory has rested on the calculation of a prevailing ratio which is applied to the total of any HACC payment to determine the Commonwealth's share of that payment. The prevailing ratio, then represents the Commonwealth's share of funds available to the HACC program in any year, excluding money which is provided outside the HACC Agreements (e.g the unmatched money from 1987 to 1991).
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1987-88 the prevailing ratio in each State and Territory was determined on the basis of continuing the relative Commonwealth and State obligations of acquitted expenditure in 1986-87 with the amount of $2-S1 money unexpended in 1986-87 and rolled-over into 1987-88. The prevailing ratio in Western Australia is currently 57.91 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 1986-87 Budget context the Commonwealth provided additional unmatched funds outside the HACC Agreements. The distribution of these funds amongst States and Territories was on a per capita basis to allow equitable distribution, although the original allocations were subject to States and Territories maintaining their effort under the HACC Agreements ie States that indexed their HACC expenditure above the national average benefited to a greater degree than those which indexed below the national average.
      </para>
      <para>
       The prevailing ratio in Western Australia will increase slightly in 1991-92 when its share of the unmatched funds provided in the 1986-87 Budget context are incorporated under the HACC Agreements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) See 2 above;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Unmatched Commonwealth funds provided to the State of Western Australia since the inception of the HACC Program comprise:
      </para>
      <para>
       1985-86--$887,000
      </para>
      <para>
       1988-89--$712,462
      </para>
      <para>
       1989-90--$1,203,115
      </para>
      <para>
       1990-91--(Est) $2,617,000
      </para>
      <para>
       The 1985-86 unmatched funds were used to fund new or expanded projects under the HACC Agreement between the Commonwealth and Western Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth unmatched funds provided in the 1986-87 Budget context were part of the Commonwealth's overall strategy to achieve a better balance between residential care and community care. These funds are being used to develop innovative service models which will explore the best ways of matching services to individual needs, as well as the evaluation of those delivery methods. They have been paid in each of the four financial years from 1987-88 to 1990-91. These funds will be incorporated into the HACC Agreements in the 1991-92 financial year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Since 1987-88 the funds available in any State/Territory have been based on the application of a negotiated indexation factor applied to the previous year's cash outlays. The Commonwealth matches the indexation factor applied by the State or Territory in its Budget context, and provides on the basis of the prevailing ratio, the Commonwealth's share of the State appropriation of total funds for the Program. There is no instance in which money has been unexpended nationally due to a lack of matching in Western Australia.

       (7) There have been various press reports about the recent price negotiations which took place between Ontario Hydro and Denison Mines in relation to a domestic Canadian uranium supply contract. The accuracy of the reports in relation to specific prices is not known. The negotiations did not result in agreement and Ontario Hydro has now given Denison notice of its intention to terminate the contract at the end of 1992. Ontario Hydro is expected to replace the Denison contract with purchases from other, lower cost, Canadian uranium producers and Denison is expected to shut down its Elliot Lake mining operations next year. This is a favourable development from the point of view of the Australian uranium industry.

       (8) The development of the Koongarra deposit, and other potential uranium mines, is precluded under current Government policy.

       Higher education institutions are self-governing bodies established under State legislation.  The Commonwealth has the responsibility to set minimum fees for overseas students enrolling in courses; in this case it is satisfied that given the services provided to students in the year, it is reasonable for the fee for the Co-operative Education Year to be less than the usual minimum indicative fee.  The Commonwealth does not have responsibility for, and does not collect information about, aspects of course provision such as those referred to in the honourable senator's question.  I am advised that those issues have been widely canvassed by a group of students known as the FIT Overseas Students Collective and that their grievances have been addressed at Institute, departmental and faculty levels with the Victoria University of Technology, as well as on an individual basis.  The honourable senator's question should therefore be directed to the Victoria University of Technology.

       Both the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration and the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts have expressed concern about the length of annual reports. The Government recognises that some increase in the length of departmental reports in recent years has been unavoidable, in view of the requirements imposed on departments. It is concerned nonetheless that reports should not become unmanageably bulky and that the costs of production should be constrained.

       The Department of Defence deserves praise for producing, in the words of the judging panel of the RAIPA Departmental Annual Reports Awards, a `remarkably concise report' which won the best annual report award for 1989-90.

       Nevertheless, because of the interest shown by parliamentarians and the general public, the Department has decided to include the Order of Battle in the 1990-91 report.

      <para>
       The operational readiness tasks of the major force elements of the Regular Army include counter terrorist operations, the capability to respond to short warning time credible threats in the defence of Australia and its direct interests, and the provision of assistance to governments of the South West Pacific region.
      </para>
      <para>
       The operational readiness tasks of the major force elements of the Army Reserve are aligned with longer warning time credible threats in the defence of Australia. These include the protection of vital assets and the maintenance of a base from which Army could be expanded to meet longer term threats.
      </para>
      <para>
       The operational readiness tasks of the Ready Reserve will be progressively developed. The Ready Reserve will have a vehicle mounted capability, which will enable it to be tasked with reaction operations aligned with medium warning time credible threats in the defence of Australia.

       (1) The Chief of the Defence Force sets preparedness standards for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) within the framework of his Operational Readiness Directive. This Directive specifies the notice at which given units of the ADF are to be ready for defined tasks and roles in the support of Australia's security.
      </para>
      <para>
       Preparedness is a force management technique which provides broad performance parameters for the ADF. Defence uses preparedness mechanisms to provide guidance on the increase in number of forces needed for expansion, and the time within which they are required to be ready.
      </para>
      <para>
       Performance specifications derived from preparedness criteria will be included in contracts to ensure that the operational readiness of ADF elements supported by these activities is not impaired.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Defence has negotiated a number of cooperative logistics support arrangements with Australia's defence partners and allies. The principal arrangements are Cooperative Defence Logistics Support Agreements with the United States and with New Zealand. These arrangements provide assurances of logistics support, which includes the acquisition of defence equipment and services from within the logistics systems of the Defence Forces of these nations, in a range of circumstances during peacetime and in contingencies.
      </para>

       In addition, the Force Structure Review notes that Memoranda of Understanding have been developed with the transport industry to provide agreed arrangements for the use of civil transport resources in times of Defence need (including exercises).

       (1) A start is to be made immediately in testing for commercialisation in a competitive process those activities included in Tier 1 of the Wrigley Interdepartmental Committee Report.  For planning purposes the Force Structure Review estimated that, arising from Tier 1 activities, 2,100 service and 1,100 civilian positions would be proposed for contracting over the decade (see para 3.16 FSR).  In the first four years these are distributed as follows:

Savings estimated for the first stages of commercialisation from both Tier 1 and the additional FSR activities are some $52m to 1999/2000 with mature annual savings of $30m expected.  In the years to 1994/95, initial costs of commercialisation are estimated to outweigh savings by a total of $11.9m (0 in 1991/92; $0.5m in 1992/93; $1.3m in 1993/94; and S10.1m in 1994/95), before net savings begin to accrue.

        —-The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1)-(4) The study undertaken by the Health Insurance Commission in August-September 1989, was aimed at assessing the level of incorrect payment resulting from the lack of entitlement checking within the program.  Prior to this the Auditor-General had referred to major deficiencies in the administration of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme program, including the lack of entitlement checking, but had not quantified the amount of incorrect payment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The study was undertaken by comparing entitlement information supplied by pharmacists for three months' claims against entitlement information supplied by the Department of Social Security (DSS). Where a valid pensioner/concession number was quoted, the study indicated that approximately 3.5 per cent of the services were found to have no pensioner or concessional entitlement at the date the service was provided.  It was also found that some 18 per cent of data was claimed using invalid numbers.  This did not necessarily mean that 18 per cent of services were paid incorrectly as it could be assumed that once the correct number was found, the level of error would be similar to that where valid numbers were used.
      </para>
      <para>
       Later that financial year the Australian Audit Office in its annual audit of the program undertook its own study to evaluate the level of error in the program. That study showed that 5.22 per cent of scripts that were checked against DSS entitlements showed that the person's entitlement had lapsed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission has taken action to ensure that the number keyed by pharmacists is correct by supplying pharmacy software companies with check digit routines that validate the construction of the number at the time that the number is entered into pharmacy PC systems.  Accordingly the use of invalid numbers has no impact on the estimate of projected savings from eligibility checking.
      </para>
      <para>
       Projected full year savings were calculated assuming an error rate of 4.5 per cent of pensioner and concessional scripts claimed.  As the two studies undertaken were not identical in their methodology and as the checks carried out by the Australian Audit Office were conducted on a smaller sample of claims this rate was considered more appropriate for calculating the savings. This rate was then applied to the expected annual volume of pensioner and concessional prescriptions of 72 million and to the expected saving of $12.50 per script, being the difference in the Government benefit for general and pensioner/concessional prescriptions.  The estimated saving of $40m represents the full year saving assuming that all pharmacists check entitlements using the interactive system.  It would be expected that this would be achieved in 1993-94.
      </para>
      <para>
       Estimated savings for 1991-92 reflect the assessed benefit to be gained from some level of post payment checking of eligibility which the Commission would expect to begin in September or October. Estimates for 1992-93 reflect the movement towards on-line entitlement checking by pharmacists in this year.

       (1) The Department of Social Security computer system does not hold information on the nature of a client's medical condition. Information is not available on the numbers of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid pension because of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). However, information derived from a survey of invalid pensioners granted pension between 1 January and 30 June 1988 indicates that 100 grants during this period were to people whose main medical condition was AIDS.
      </para>

       (2) The Department's guidelines on income support for people infected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and those who have acquired AIDS recognise the varying impact of these conditions on individuals' capacity for work. Those who are asymptomatic to the HIV virus usually receive unemployment benefit unless there are unrelated medical factors that would qualify them for either sickness benefit or invalid pension.

       The 1988 survey of invalid pensioners granted pension between January and June 1988 indicated that the main medical conditions among invalid pensioners were: musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases (27.7 per cent) (including disorders of the spine (16.6 per cent)), mental disorders (19.3 per cent), circulatory system diseases (15.0 per cent) and nervous system and sense organs diseases (12.8 per cent).

       With reference to the remarkable success of America's immigration policy 34,000,000 people from all parts of the world entered that country and the fact that the immigrants were the catalyst for a surge of growth that has made America the country it is today, with the example set by the American immigration policy and the success of our migration policies during the 1940s and 1950s, does the Government intend to re-examine its present migration policy to see if a major influx of migrants could have a beneficial effect on Australia's economy.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Government has migration policies in place which are relevant to Australia's needs and which have been the subject of rigorous examination and review. The effects of immigration on the Australian economy are far better understood now than they were in the 1940s and 1950s. One of the reasons for this is the existence of the Bureau of Immigration Research (BIR) which was established by the Government in early 1989 as part of its response to the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies (CAAIP).
      </para>
      <para>
       The considerable amount of research produced by the BIR and by other agencies such as the National Population Council, is taken into account in the formulation of the migration program and policies along with the findings of inquiries such as CAAIP and the results of consultations with Commonwealth, State and Territory government agencies and the community. The views of the Parliament also inform policy development, for example, through the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations.
      </para>
      <para>
       A growing body of research by the BIR has found that, appropriately targeted, immigration confers positive economic benefits on the Australian population, particularly in the longer term. The 1991-92 migration program announced on 30 April 1991 takes this research into account. Our program and policies maintain a balance between economic, social and humanitarian objectives. At the same time they recognise the importance of short and medium term factors such as falling demand for migration to Australia, and current labour market conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The planning levels for 1992-93 and 1993-94 announced at the same time are set in anticipation of an increased demand for migration created by a stronger economy. These levels will be kept under review by the Government, particularly in light of the current inquiry by the National Population Council into the economic, social and environmental impacts of various levels of population growth in Australia through to the year 2030. The Council has produced a discussion paper and will make its final report to the Government late this year.
