        <para in-line="1">
         —The Full Bench of the national wage case handed down a decision in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission at 10 o'clock this morning in Melbourne. The decision was in response to a claim taken by the Australian Council of Trade Unions to seek, in short, the agreement by the Commission that accord mark 6 would be awarded as a wage package to Australian workers. Accord mark 6 consisted of a $12 wage increase from 16 June, a provision for a 3 per cent increase in superannuation entitlement by award employees commencing on a phased-in basis of one per cent a year from 1 July this year, and for guidelines to be handed down to guide company level negotiations in a managed decentralising of the centralised wage fixing system.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Commission decided in view of the submissions that it would award a 2.5 per cent wage increase to be applied for by unions to be added to their awards in exchange for a continuance by those unions of the structural efficiency process and award restructuring changes; for the superannuation claim to be recommended to go to a conference of the parties; and for any company level negotiation guidelines not to be imposed at this stage but inviting the parties to come back on 1 November next in order that that and other matters of wage fixation in Australia can be considered.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am asked by Senator Foreman what the Government's reaction to this decision is. The Government's reaction is that we are disappointed that the national wage case bench did not endorse accord mark 6 in its entirety. We believe that the accord mark 6 package is sustainable and is appropriate in the current economic climate; that the flat $12 wage increase that I referred to as part of that package would have been better for lower income earners in Australia than a percentage amount of 2 1/2 per cent. Let me illustrate that: workers on average weekly earnings of $590 a week, under the 2 1/2 per cent increase, get $14.75. But low income earners typifying an average award earnings level of approximately $432 a week would get a $10.80 increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        The $12 would have addressed the needs of lower income earners more fairly. We in the Government freely acknowledge that millions of Australian working people have shouldered the burden of restraint in this community, but we believe that it is wrong for the lower paid workers in this community, on a percentage increase, to shoulder a greater burden of that restraint.
       </para>
       <para>
        The deferral of superannuation delays progress in the Government's retirement income strategy. We recognise that it is necessary to ensure that there is proper retirement provision to supplement age pensions. We are sorry that the Commission did not proceed with the claim in that respect. We will now consider our options on that issue.

        <para in-line="1">
         —I said we are considering our options on that issue. As far as the restructuring of the awards is concerned, we are pleased that the Commission has brought down a decision which will encourage further progress in that matter. But we are frustrated by the fact that, despite there being a tripartite consensus between employers, unions and the Government before the Commission, the Commission has at this stage decided not to hand down guidelines for company level negotiations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We would have thought that those guidelines would be appropriate in the circumstances but we will now build on the consensus that exists between employers, unions and the Government around that issue to redress the matter before the Commission in November. I point out, however, that there is extensive flexibility within the existing principles, and the most obvious flexibility is for certified agreements now to be taken out where, at a company level, negotiations between employers and unions come to an appropriate outcome for that enterprise. That is clearly the way that the Commission is now signalling they should go.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the last point, enterprise or company level negotiations, there is no interchangeability of terms as far as the Government is concerned in the context of the way in which the Opposition uses this term. Mr Howard frequently uses this term; he is to the right of Greiner on this matter. At least the Greiner Government recognises the Professor Niland thesis, that there should be in Australia what amounts to collective bargaining and bargaining based on the enterprise. In that thesis the right to strike is an element of the package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Howard does not recognise that. He wants to take Australia down the New Zealand road-a road in which there is no Commission, no umpire, and therefore no assurance of fair play. He wants to take Australia down the New Zealand road, which bypasses the union's role in representing workers in a workplace negotiation, and have individuals negotiate at enterprise level their individual work contracts with the big company, as if one person in a negotiation with a major company represents fair play.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to differentiate between the terms. We are talking about enterprise negotiation in a vastly different and more managed way with the social partners, the employers and the unions, not in the extremist view that the Opposition is presenting.

I cannot recall how much money they gave us, but I suspect it was nothing because they had nothing. Nevertheless, I went out to visit them. Over the course of the past couple of months I have also been all over Australia, including to the country areas of New South Wales, visiting the homes of sole parents who cannot afford shoes for their children. I cannot say that I recall their giving us any money either because they had none. Therefore, the idea that access is given only to those who are Party donors is nonsense. I simply made the statement that when I was raising money-and that does not go for anyone else in the Labor Party-I would guarantee people access.

        The Government will continue to do all it can through bilateral and multilateral representations to achieve a transfer of power to a democratic government in Burma. The military regime has responded to last year's election victory by the National League for Democracy with what can only be described as a series of repressive and intimidatory measures violating fundamental human rights. The leader of the National League for Democracy, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, remains, as Senator Bourne said, under house arrest, almost two years after she was first detained. By the regime's own admission, over 35 elected members of the NLD or affiliated parties, as well as others political activists, remain under detention and may yet be put on trial. The Australian Government has condemned these abuses and has taken every opportunity, including direct representations, to encourage the military regime to observe internationally accepted standards of human rights, to release all political prisoners and to accede to the popular desire for democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am able to say a little further that press reports about a resumption of Australian aid were based on an interview with the Australian Ambassador to Burma. These reports were accurate in so far as they reported his assessment that a transfer of power to a democratic government in Burma appears to be a long way off and his view that Australia will have to accept these political realities. However, reports that the Ambassador spoke of any policy shift or suggested that any resumption of aid could be expected in the short term are quite inaccurate. I repeat that the Government's policy remains as I have stated it and the Ambassador is fully aware of that.

         —The EC first foreshadowed the removal of sanctions on South African iron, steel and gold coins-Kruger rands as they are called-at the EC heads of government meeting in Rome in December. The EC tied the lifting of these sanctions to the tabling of legislation to repeal the group areas and land Acts. With that legislation now tabled, the EC announcement yesterday comes as no surprise. From an Australian and Commonwealth perspective, its timing remains unhelpful and unfortunate. In our view, it is too soon to be lifting trade sanctions. We regard the maintenance of pressure on South Africa as being crucial at this stage when promises must still be translated into actions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The EC still has in place a range of sanctions that it did impose in 1985, including the arms embargo, a ban on oil exports to South Africa and the prohibition of new collaboration in the nuclear sector. We certainly hope that there will not be any move by the EC to lift those sanctions at present. The Australian and Commonwealth position on sanctions was made very clear at the London meeting of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa in February. At that meeting the Commonwealth agreed to a phased approach to the lifting of sanctions as the South African Government met its various commitments to dismantle apartheid.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that basis, we can expect in the first instance the lifting of the so-called `people oriented' sanctions-which include restrictions on cultural, academic and scientific contacts; visas; the promotion of tourism and air links-once the South African Government has met that series of specific initial conditions, namely, the release of remaining political prisoners; the removal of obstacles preventing the return of exiles; the review and repeal of repressive security legislation; and the actual repeal of the three important pillar pieces of legislation, the group areas, land and population registration Acts. Other sanctions will be lifted in accordance with the Commonwealth agreement once further major steps are taken towards constitutional reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the United States of America is committed to leaving sanctions in place until the South African Government complies with the conditions established under the comprehensive anti-apartheid Act. It seems wholly unlikely that those conditions will be met, even on a fairly optimistic view, before the end of June.

         —The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided me with the following information. In 1988, the Government asked the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) to conduct a major inquiry into the portrayal, depiction and reporting of violence on television. This initiative arose out of concern expressed during the Premiers Conference on gun control in December 1987, which was, in turn, in response to events such as the Queen Street and Hoddle Street massacres. The ensuing report recommended an approach of supervised self-regulation as the best response to the acknowledged community concern about violence on television. In the judgment of the Tribunal, the industry has now acknowledged the public concern and has committed itself to ways of rectifying the situation. The Government fully supports the recommendation made in the Tribunal's report, but it has acted to ensure that safeguards can be put into place if necessary.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the past few months, the ABT has worked closely with the television industry to develop a comprehensive code on violence to guide program makers and schedulers. Although this code is an industry code, it is subject to acceptance by the ABT and the Tribunal will regularly measure the progress of its implementation through the normal commercial television licence renewal process. The interests of the public will be further safeguarded through an ABT review of the effectiveness of this code after six months of operation. The code outlines what material might cause serious distress to viewers, provides for warnings of material which may cause offence, and gives guidelines as to where violent and distressing material should or should not be used.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report stresses that individuals in the community must also accept a responsibility to regulate their own, and their children's, viewing. The Government is pleased to note that the television industry has agreed to undertake a public awareness campaign so that as many people as possible know about the new code and can use it to plan their own viewing. The campaign should also inform more members of the public on how to take timely action to complain of any suspected breaches of the code.

         —I have seen a transcript of the interview-although I did not listen to it-between Mr Costello, the Opposition spokesman on business and consumer affairs, and Matt Abraham this morning on ABC radio. I must say that it amounts to a complete rewriting of the history of the regulation of companies and securities in the Commonwealth of Australia. Mr Costello says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . the absolute failure of corporate regulation under the Hawke Government is transparent but over the last seven or eight years they showed absolutely no interest whatsoever in enforcing the current laws and ensuring that they did something to protect shareholders and creditors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that that is completely and utterly inconsistent with the historical record. I am only sorry that the Russian school children have departed the gallery because they would see in Mr Peter Costello's comments the same rewriting of history as occurred in Russia under the old regime before glasnost and perestroika.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that it was the coalition which introduced the inadequate arrangements under the National Companies and Securities Commission which led to a situation where there was no clear line of political responsibility from that Commission to any one parliament or to any one Minister responsible to a parliament. It took this Government to introduce legislation to make sure that in relation to companies and securities regulation there was one parliament, namely, this Parliament, which created the laws and one Minister, namely the Federal Attorney-General, who was responsible for the correct, proper, adequate and forceful enforcement of that legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, it took four or five years of tortuous debate in this chamber after the report handed down by a committee under the chairmanship of Senator Nick Bolkus, and overcoming a lot of obstruction in this place, before that framework could be put into place. Mr Costello also said of the Western Australian situation:
       </para>
       <para>
        It was the Federal Coalition that persuaded them-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the upper House in Western Australia-
       </para>
       <para>
        to go along with a national scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is completely and utterly absurd. In fact, the coalition parties in the upper House in Western Australia rejected what late overtures were made to it by Dr Hewson. It was not until the business community in Western Australia realised the absurd situation that it was being led into by the upper House in Western Australia that the coalition in that chamber collapsed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, it was only when it was revealed, for example, that sharebrokers in Western Australia would have to withdraw from that State and relocate in South Australia that the situation became so patently intolerable as far as the business community in Western Australia was concerned. In Western Australia there was a secessionist mentality, a la 1930, whereby the coalition forces in the upper House in Western Australia wanted effectively to withdraw from the national marketplace. That had to be overcome by the sheer force of our persuasion and that of the business community in Western Australia between last Christmas and the new year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, Mr Costello said that what one needed was a more vigilant Australian Securities Commission. That is precisely what this Government has provided by giving very adequate funding to enable 16 major investigations to be undertaken by Mr Hartnell and the Australian Securities Commission. The Australian Securities Commission was opposed right up to the last minute even by the Federal coalition and certainly by the coalition forces in Western Australia. It is precisely this Government that has provided a mechanism, under Mr Hartnell and the Australian Securities Commission, to forcefully ensure that the will of the Parliament in relation to companies and securities regulation is fulfilled.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that everything Mr Costello has said about the record of the Federal Government in this respect is utterly at odds with the historical record, and I am pleased that Senator Beahan, as the Chairman of the new Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, has a very real interest in these matters, and has brought it to the attention of the chamber.

         —At the outset, let me say that I have not seen the specifics of Senator Powell's statement. I have seen some reports of it, but the reports differ. The Government's motivation in presenting its package of proposals is two-fold: firstly, to ensure a transparent process; and, secondly, to reduce the cost of campaigning. We believe-and we have some support in this-that the total problem cannot be addressed solely by disclosure legislation. That is one issue that this Senate and the Democrats have to grapple with.

        When we look at the fact that over the last three election campaigns, for instance, electronic advertising costs have increased three-fold, we see that there is an enormous problem. That cannot be addressed purely by disclosure legislation; nor can it be addressed by those sorts of provisions that Senator Powell has reportedly been talking about. There are two motivations, and we believe that this Parliament has a responsibility to address them as one total package because disclosure legislation is not enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contrary to the mumblings of the Opposition, we are supported here even by Mr Howard. In an article at the weekend, Mr Howard made the point that the United States has had elaborate disclosure laws for years. These did not stop a former Vice-President, Spiro Agnew, from receiving corrupt payments while occupying the second highest political position in that country. We have a position which goes both to the costs of campaigning as well as to the need to disclose donations and the income and expenditure of political parties and third party organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Powell's points with respect to fairness in broadcasting and truth in advertising do not go to those particular issues and do not address the enormous costs of campaigning. She has put those positions. I have not seen the details of them, but if the proposal is for an instant right of reply, as Senator Olsen has depicted and as I have read in the press, obviously it is not a goer. But if Senator Powell is talking about something else, I am sure I will get it directly from her and not through newspapers.

They are the substantial pieces of legislation that will be addressed.

We have to await the drafting of that legislation.

        When we made the decision to introduce legislation, I made it clear that it was our intention to do so before the Senate got up in June or July. It was also our intention to try to have that legislation passed by the Senate by that time. So there is no reluctance on the part of this Government to proceed with this. We recognise that we have to address the issues. I must say, Senator Olsen, that we have recognised issues in this area for quite some time. We have recognised the need to alleviate the cost of campaigning. We have also recognised the need for disclosure legislation.

       <para>
        Let me also say that at every turn over the last seven years we have met with strident opposition from the other side. Let me make a prediction about the Opposition's new conversion to disclosure legislation. There are so many holes in Dr Hewson's statement on disclosure, there are so many contradictions with that of Mr Goldsworthy, there are so many qualifications that the Opposition will not support it in the end, as it has resisted it in the past. The Opposition will throw in irrelevant issues. But to us, the basic issue of disclosure legislation-the one that we are proposing-is that such legislation will go as far as is constitutionally possible. It will be based on the principle of equity and the principle of transparency. What we are concerned about is to obtain legislation in this Parliament as soon as possible to provide full disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of when-let me answer that once more. Let me put this on the table in closing: when this legislation gets through the Parliament depends very much on what sort of opposition we will get from the Opposition. The Opposition has had a long history of opposing this sort of legislation in the past. If it is frustrated in its passage through the Parliament, it will only be because of the Opposition side.

        In so far as the goldmining industry is concerned, from 1 January 1991 the goldmining industry became subject to income tax on the same basis as other industries. Transition arrangements are based on standard taxation principles. In particular, allowance is made for any stocks of ore and other partly or fully processed material that may be on hand as at 1 January 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of these arrangements is that profit accrued up to 1 January 1991 from business activity in the gold industry conducted prior to 1 January 1991, which may be reflected in the value of stocks at that time, will be free of tax whereas profit arising from activity conducted after 1 January 1991 will be subject to income tax in the normal way.

        In so far as the last part of the question involves a request for valuations of stockpiles and so on by the Taxation Commissioner, I am sure that is a matter which the Commissioner will have in hand as normal practice. But in case that is not so, I will have that passed on.

         —I have no intention of organising a march in Brisbane when the ships come back in. My decision is based on discussions with the various sailors on those ships. When those ships berth, the sailors do not want to waste another eight hours marching through Brisbane or anywhere else; they want to reunite with family and friends, have a quiet ale in some cases, et cetera.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Bjelke-Petersen has also raised the question of inopportune timing. My original timing for these sorts of visits is to have the VIPs go on board the ships before they land, so that when the ships pull in the sailors do not have politicians getting in the road when they have their family reunions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my absence last week, the timing of the visits was changed. People did not think through the consequences of that. I subsequently looked at it on my return to Australia and reverted to the original timetable. This afternoon I am involved in the process of contacting everyone, including a couple of colleagues here, to try to re-establish the original timetable. That will mean that the various VIPs will meet the ships around 8.30 a.m.; the ships will then proceed up the Brisbane River, as did all the previous ships when they visited other ports, and things will run according to that plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bjelke-Petersen raised two points. One was about the timing. That has now been fixed, or was in the process of being fixed this afternoon. In relation to a march, I think it gives more joy to those who are greeting the march, than the marchers. However, we have said that once all servicemen have returned from the Gulf-and I remind Senator Bjelke-Petersen that the divers, the people from Western Australia and some personnel from the logistics support element are still in the Middle East-it would then be appropriate to have one march. That is being planned for August. It has been planned for Sydney, not necessarily out of any preference for Sydney, but because that is where the majority of the servicemen live.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is the most appropriate time to have a march. Again, I guess it is a matter of choice. But I think that if a sailor who has been at sea for that amount of time lobs in at 11 o'clock, he does not really want to be told that he is going on a three or four-hour march so that everyone can wave flags. It is a time for families.

         —I have seen those reports and they reflect a number of earlier indications of interest that have been given by the Soviet authorities to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation process and the possibility of their eventually becoming participants in it. The response to date by the APEC participants, including Australia, has been to say that the crucial criterion for membership is the degree of economic linkage between the country in question and the other 12 existing participants in the APEC group. While the Soviet far east in particular manifestly has the potential to become a flourishing regional economy in its own right with a substantial set of linkages with Japan, China and the other countries in the region, those linkages simply do not exist at the moment. Of course, in the present economic circumstances confronting the Soviet Union there is rather less likelihood that they will be rapidly developed than might previously have been the case. I would not expect any rapid move towards the perception that that criterion will be satisfied. Some have suggested that it should also be regarded as a relevant consideration whether the country in question has a market economy. I think that is regarded by most of the APEC participants as a less relevant criterion than the sheer fact of existing or impending linkage of the kind that I have described.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What is important about the APEC process is that it embrace as many as humanly possible of all the significant economies in the region. It is only with that degree of participation that the objectives of APEC in terms of regional and worldwide trade liberalisation, sectoral cooperation, data exchange and so on can be fully realised. With that in mind, the first priority of the APEC countries at the moment is to try to accomplish the participation in the process of the three big economies in the region which manifestly have such links at the moment, and they are the People's Republic of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. As I said in answer to a question earlier this week, that process is well and truly in train. We hope very much that that will be able to be achieved by the Seoul meeting in October. I think that it will be a rather longer process achieving consensus about the appropriateness of Soviet participation, but it is certainly not something that any of us would wish to rule out in principle.

        I regard Comcare's performance as a provider of compensation and rehabilitation services to members of the Australian Public Service as good. It has improved its reputation by taking steps to ensure that, where injured workers are required to be off work, they are got back into the working environment as soon as possible, even if that means redesigning their jobs, so that they are not cut off from the normal society that they enjoy at work and not left to suffer loss of self-esteem at home while they are recovering from serious injuries. That has meant that the cost of premiums has fallen significantly to the recipient departments and agencies to which Comcare provides its service. The terms of reference reflect an inquiry to see whether that can be improved upon. I do not have it in my mind exactly when the inquiry is to report, but I have it in mind that it is to report fairly soon. I will provide that information to Senator Reid.

       <para>
        The question has four parts: yes, there is a review into the operations of Austrade. I do not know what Senator Watson means by operational staff numbers being increased in regional areas. Certainly the burden of the report is that operational staff numbers should be increased in this region of the world and in various countries of the Asia-Pacific region as distinct from North America and Europe where more common languages and more common business cultures apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        The closing of regional offices is a matter which has to be worked through and negotiated with the States in part and that process is in train at the present time. I cannot give an unequivocal guarantee about the Tasmanian office. But when that matter comes to me on the basis of a recommendation from Austrade or discussions with Austrade, I will bear in mind the representations which have been made to me by Senator Tate and Senator Watson.

I would invite Senator Tierney to have a look at the 12 March statement. What the Prime Minister said in the House of Representatives I said here in the Senate, and we were quite explicit about it. What was achieved in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and announced by the Prime Minister in the 12 March statement was that an agreement in principle had been reached with the assistance of the Industrial Relations Commission-a body which, thank goodness, is still in operation and which the Opposition, of course, has pledged to abolish.

        What Senator Tierney says is an absolute nonsense. An agreement in principle has been reached. The parties then gave a commitment that a drafting committee would be set up, which has been set up. Conaust, in fact, on the front page of the Daily Commercial News, which is the major trade paper of the industry, announced that the target for the completion of that agreement would be May.

To conclude, the actual difference between the parties is in fact tiny. It is a matter of 1 or 2 per cent. The appropriate opportunity to debate that in detail is at a later time and not in Question Time. If the honourable senator would like me to give him a detailed briefing on the log of claims made by both parties-not an unusual situation, I might add, in an industrial negotiation-he would find that the real difference between the parties is very small. There was a hearing of the Commission yesterday on this issue. A further hearing has been set down for Friday of this week, and I am confident that with the assistance of the Industrial Relations Commission the parties will resolve their differences in the normal manner.

Every time a recommendation from the Remuneration Tribunal comes for increasing our salaries, we as a group rise up and say, `No, we do not want it; take it back'. The Opposition thinks that the only people who have an interest in increases in wages are waterside workers.

        —by leave-I have been misrepresented. Just after midday on Friday, 12 April 1991, Fran Kelly recorded an interview with me for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) PM program. It lasted for about five minutes. While recognising that it may be edited, I expected it to go to air as an interview with me. It did not. The PM program put to air on Friday, 12 April, presented allegations about financial and other involvements by Australian Labor Party people in Western Australian in union elections, including a Transport Workers Union of Australia election in New South Wales. It ran for about seven minutes and included two small grabs, 49 words in total, from the five-minute interview I had done earlier that day.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I did not hear the PM program and did not receive a transcript until yesterday afternoon. In the PM program Fran Kelly, who, I understand, is ex-3JJJ, asked a rhetorical question not of me but of her audience as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Is money from Western Australia being used by unions in New South Wales?
      </para>
      <para>
       She then asserted as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       There is some evidence to back up that link. Here is the former Finance Minister in the Hawke Government, Senator Peter Walsh.
      </para>
      <para>
       Then came the first voice grab from my previous five-minute interview as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Money from the Western Australian leaders' account was transferred to New South Wales for purposes of an intra State union election.
      </para>
      <para>
       My clear recollection is that immediately preceding that grab were the words, `It has been reported that', which then, of course, becomes, `It has been reported that money has been transferred from the leaders' account' et cetera, et cetera. By omitting those words the ABC transformed what was a factual statement by me about what had been in last week's newspapers, into an assertion by me that money was transferred. It had previously been misdescribed as evidence. I can only say that had the witness been tendering evidence like that on oath in a court he would have been promptly placed in the slammer.
      </para>
      <para>
       The interviewer, Kelly, was repeatedly told by me during the five-minute interview, and prior to the interview, that I had almost no knowledge of either the receipts or expenditure of the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party or the leaders' account, and that I had never been involved with that sort of Party administration. Nevertheless, she persisted in asking questions, it is now apparent, to get some words to misuse in support of conclusions pre-determined by the ABC.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following an earlier call from my staff I rang the PM producer, Kerry Weal, just after 5 p.m. yesterday. She told me that the full tape, which was about five minutes, of the interview with me by Kelly had hit the floor on Friday evening-that is, it no longer existed. I asked her to treat my comments about the PM item-at least as they affected me-as a formal complaint.
      </para>
      <para>
       Just before 5 p.m. I had spoken to Marian Wilkinson, the producer of the ABC's Four Corners program, in case Four Corners intended to use some of its first cousin's misrepresentations on its program last night, and explained what had been done by PM. Wilkinson told me that Four Corners would not be using it and added that her own reaction on hearing PM on Friday night was, `How would he'-that is, me-`know that?' There are sceptics even inside the ABC.
      </para>
      <para>
       When putting together last Friday's PM program the ABC was clearly determined to weave some of my words, regardless of sense or context, into the fabric of its hypothesis. I do not believe its actions should be attributed to incompetence. The ABC wilfully misrepresented what I had said. There are several ABC precedents, but this was the most gross breach of journalistic ethics that I have personally encountered, with the possible exception of an item some 10 years ago by Ronald Andersen.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whether the blame should be attributed to Kelly or Weal or both I do not know. I have been told-I believe reliably-that any journalist in the commercial electronic media who behaved similarly would be sacked. This, of course, will not happen in the ABC. At best, there will be an internal inquiry which will find the ABC innocent.
      </para>
      <para>
       I give a bit of advice to all politicians, which I should have heeded. Do not appear on ABC current affairs programs unless they are broadcast live. Corrected though the ABC's misrepresentation now is, the mischief cannot be entirely undone. This gruesome misrepresentation by the ABC can, at any time in the future, be quoted from the seemingly authoritative source of PM on 12 April 1991.

       Tobacco Advertising
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.

      </para>
      <para>
       1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely effect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.

        DEFENCE FORCE SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        The Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill has the effect of making the existing Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits scheme a closed scheme. That is to say that the only persons who will be permitted to join the superseded scheme will be pensioner re-entrants who choose not to join the new Military Superannuation and Benefits scheme and a couple of rare classes of re-entrants.
       </para>
       <para>
        However the DFRDB scheme will last for many years. When all existing contributors have retired there will still be pensioners under the scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill amends the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 (DFRDB Act) and is mainly directed to improvements in the administration of the DFRDB scheme, by removing uncertainties about the operation of certain provisions and to make some minor improvements to the scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The DFRB scheme of 1948 also remains in existence for pensioners only. Some of the amendments are appropriate for that scheme and the Bill accordingly includes amendments of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948 (DFRB Act).
       </para>
       <para>
        The matters dealt with in the Bill include:
       </para>
       <para>
        changes to the constitution and manner of appointment of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority to reflect its more limited role;
       </para>
       <para>
        compulsory cessation of contributions by members who have at least 40 year's effective service;
       </para>
       <para>
        provision of specific power for the DFRDB Authority to classify and reclassify members for invalidity purposes in certain cases of death;
       </para>

        FINANCIAL IMPACT
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed amendments to the two Acts will have a small impact on the costs of the DFRDB and DFRB schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Continuation of payment of a full pension to the spouse of a deceased pensioner for six pay periods after his or her death will result in increased costs of $160,000 per annum. Some of this additional cost will be offset by administrative savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The estimated cost of providing a commutation option for re-entered DFRDB pensioners on their subsequent retirement from the Defence Force would be around $88,000 per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The DFRDB revenue foregone as a result of the cessation of contributions for members with 40 years service will amount to $36,000 in the first year after this amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other changes in the Bill will have a minimal cost impact.

        ALBURY-WODONGA DEVELOPMENT
       </para>
       <para>
        AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill amends the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation's membership arrangements, changes annual reporting requirements, introduces reciprocal mobility rights for staff and approves execution of the Albury-Wodonga Area Development Agreement Amendment Agreement (No. 2).
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes are part of a package of wide-ranging reforms to the Albury-Wodonga project. The reforms have been agreed amongst the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian Governments as partners in the project. Complementary State legislation and relevant Commonwealth/State agreements are also being amended.
       </para>
       <para>
        The three Governments have decided that the Corporation is now to concentrate on profitable development and marketing of its land holdings. Nevertheless, it will continue to play an important role in land use and social planning, economic development and promotion of the area, although, primary responsibility for these functions will reside with the relevant Local Government bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reform package has four main thrusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, Corporation financial management practices and accountability to the three Governments are to be improved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth and the two State Albury-Wodonga Corporations will be able to produce one consolidated annual report instead of three separate reports, one for each Parliament, as has been the case until now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendments to the Albury-Wodonga Area Development Agreement will remove impediments to the preparation of consolidated accounts and remove redundant provisions for determining the amount of money appropriated by each Government for the Corporation's activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other important measures, such as performance reporting and attentiveness to the profitability of property development, are already being introduced on Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, the activities undertaken by the Corporation are to have their scale and focus changed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most functions and responsibilities normally undertaken by Local Government are to be handed back to Local Government including land use planning powers and provision and maintenance of physical and social infrastructure, such as roads, sewerage, open space and community centres.
       </para>
       <para>
        Except for participation in matters of region-wide significance, decided periodically by the Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council, the Corporation will operate on the same basis as any other property developer. Transition arrangements are currently in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Collectively these measures will give the community, particularly through its elected members in Local Government, the power to determine its own future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, the Corporation's three full-time executive members are to be replaced with part-time equivalents and responsibility for day-to-day operations is to pass to the Corporation's most senior staff member. Local Government membership on the Corporation is to be changed from being the Mayors of Albury and Wodonga on an ex-officio basis to the appointment of a member of each Council. Reciprocal mobility rights for staff are being introduced. The Corporation's internal organisation is being restructured to reflect its new role and objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures will ensure the Corporation's structure is prepared for implementation of the reform package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the unwieldy provisions governing returns for equity holders will be replaced with simpler mechanisms. This will make it easier for the Commonwealth as the owner of almost all the equity in the project to obtain a better return on its $120m (historic cost) investment in the project.
       </para>
       <para>
        These reforms are included in proposed amendments to the Commonwealth/State Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1973 financial agreement. In keeping with that Act, the Agreement's amendments will be tabled in this Parliament when executed by the three Governments.This Bill and the associated reforms will contribute to strengthening the viability of the project and assisting non-metropolitan development in Australia.

      <para>
       It is the Government's industry policy that manufacturing industry become more export-oriented, internationally competitive and less dependent on Government intervention. The general lowering of tariff assistance has been a major step in the implementation of that policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian industry has to become accustomed to competing in the world market with a minimum of tariff and other assistance. The wheelchair manufacturing industry is not exempt from that necessity.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is expected that a local wheelchair manufacturing industry producing goods that are competitive on price, quality, service backup will be able to compete with imported competition. In its Report on ``Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities'' the Industry Commission said ``There appears to be a strong natural advantage held by Australian producers, even for basic models, generated by the ready availability of service and spare parts.'' (Page 127) Contact between officers of my Department and representatives of the wheelchair manufacturing industry confirms that producers concentrating on quality goods and services believe they will compete successfully. At least one producer expects to be exporting within a very short time.

      Housing: Negative Gearing

         Senator Button

       <para in-line="1">
        —On 27 November 1990 (Hansard, page 4544) Senator Spindler asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the restrictions in the tax law applying to the negative gearing of rental property. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The restrictions in the tax law applying to the negative gearing of rental property investments were removed on 15 September 1987. These restrictions had been introduced on 17 July 1985 to limit the ability of high marginal rate taxpayers to derive excessive tax benefits at the general community's expense through gearing arrangements on investments where much of the return took the form of tax free capital gains.
      </para>
      <para>
       After the introduction of the negative gearing measure, the Government acted to reduce the benefit of investors receiving tax free capital gains with the implementation of the capital gains tax. It also reduced the benefit of deductions for interest by reducing the top marginal personal tax rate to 49 per cent on 1 July 1987.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subsequent to introducing the restrictions on the negative gearing of rental property investments, the Government conducted extensive reviews of interest deductions in respect of primary production investments and corporate share purchases. In both of these cases, it was decided that, as a matter of principle, interest deductions should be permitted against income from any source.
      </para>
      <para>
       The quarantining of rental property investments was left as the only case of its type in the Australian tax system. As a consequence, investors tended to move out of rental property investments to other, unquarantined, forms of activity, dampening the growth in the provision of rental accommodation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Against this background, the Government decided that continued quarantining of rental property investments could not be justified, on either efficiency or equity grounds. The Government did not remove the restrictions on negative gearing to encourage investment in low cost rental housing as such; rather, it was seen as removing an undesirable impediment to investment in all rental property, vis-a-vis investments in other assets.
      </para>
      <para>
       The current tax treatment of negative gearing of rental properties recognises that expenses associated with rental property are incurred in deriving income and, as such, should be deductible. The Government therefore does not accept that there is any concession involving a cost to revenue arising from the current treatment of the negative gearing of rental properties.
