       Let me explain that this procedure is necessary because these Bills were referred to committees on the motions of senators rather than on the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee. Pursuant to standing order 115(3), it is necessary for these Bills to be formally restored to the Notice Paper and listed for consideration. I also suggest that the Procedure Committee look at a way around this, rather than having to move such motions each time.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I entered a number of reservations to the Committee report in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). I want to explore a little further this morning two of those reservations. The others could be explored, but I will not do that on this occasion because of pressures of other business. The first matter concerns the management of the Department. Notwithstanding some improvements, the evidence is that much improvement is still to be desired. However, I believe there is a better mechanism for pursuing those ongoing concerns, and I will continue to look at that other mechanism for doing that. Therefore, I do not intend to deal further with that issue this morning.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second reservation is the ongoing concern of damaging leaks from the Department. Despite the expressions of concern by the Secretary of the Department to the Committee, who referred to feeling a sense of shame, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who acknowledged in the end that he recognised that the problem was serious and indicated he was doing his best to counter this stream of leaks from the Department that had occurred over the past year or so-in fact, he indicated that a great deal of injected momentum from him had been added in the past few days before the Estimates Committee which he believed would reduce the possibility of this occurring in the future- the leaking of confidential documents from within the Department that can be damaging to Australia's interests continues.
       </para>
       <para>
        The mechanisms that have been put in place are therefore clearly inadequate. It is astonishing that so many of these abuses have been referred to the Australian Federal Police, yet no action has been taken in the vast majority of cases. With the added mechanisms that have been implemented within the Department to deter these abuses and investigate the past abuses, no finding or action has been brought against any person.
       </para>
       <para>
        The latest in this sequence that I noticed was reported only on Monday of this week in the Australian Financial Review. It concerned what was described as a `confidential Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade cable', involving the Singapore armed forces (SAF) in Burma. Apparently the cable states that the SAF had deployed intelligence gathering teams to the area and that they had used their own vehicles. The assessment of the officer in the cable is quoted in this report as indicating, if the reports are true, that the intelligence teams are operating in conjunction with the Thai armed forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        The leakage of such a cable clearly is damaging to our interests with Singapore and Thailand. I will not say `with Burma', but one must wonder what the governments of Singapore and Thailand think of DFAT and the Minister's administration of the Department when they should be embarrassed by what should be internal assessments made by Australian foreign affairs officers being put on the world media through further illegal leakages from within the Department. There have been many instances that I and others have brought to the attention of the Minister over the last year or two. I doubt whether there is much point in my even asking the Minister what he is going to do on this occasion because no doubt he will simply say, again, `We are doing our best'. This is evidence that something is seriously wrong. We do not know exactly what it is but it is not being resolved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third reservation that I have put down to the report concerns the ex gratia termination payments to Ambassador Burke. It is still our belief that that is a correct expression of what Ambassador Burke received. However, I do not want to take it any further today. Our position has been made clear in the past. The fourth reservation concerns activities by Mr Burke outside the scope of his duties as Ambassador to Ireland. I want to ask the Minister some further questions because there are unanswered issues in that regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fifth reservation concerns the proposed human rights visit to China. I trust that progress is being made to ensure that those on that mission receive the necessary level of access for them to perform their responsibilities in a way in which their assessment and conclusions can be treated seriously by the international community. If they are not, it will simply be a matter of embarrassment to Australia and counterproductive to the goal that we would all wish, and that is, to see improved human rights in China.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next concerns funding of activities relating to the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad in southern Africa, which is a matter that is being pursued elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next concerns aspects in relation to Mr Burke's telephone accounts in Dublin that I do want to raise this morning because of inconsistencies in the evidence that was given to the Committee from the documents that were later tabled by the Minister in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        I return to the first of the two issues which I want to explore further concerning the activities that the Government endorsed for Mr Burke that went beyond his responsibilities to Ireland and the Holy See. In particular, I want to ask the Minister about the visit by Mr Burke to Geneva which was endorsed specifically by the Minister and noted on a document which the Minister tabled in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        For some time, the answer of the Minister was largely that all of this information had been given to Mr Peacock. Now that I have been able to obtain the document that, in fact, was given to Mr Peacock, I find that that is scanty, to put it at its best. The Parliament still does not know the purpose of the visit by Mr Burke to Geneva when he was Ambassador to Ireland-a visit which, apparently, was with the mining magnate Mr Hancock to meet with Soviet officials about some business activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Everyone would acknowledge that that is a strange assignment for an ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, but we do know of the previous close relationship between Mr Hancock and Mr Burke. We now know, of course, through the revelations of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia of the huge financial support that Mr Hancock had given to Mr Burke when he was in office as Premier of the State of Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I want to know is: what was the purpose of that mission? What did it cost the Australian taxpayer? Were there any Australian officials present other than Mr Burke, who seems to have been described quaintly as having an official capacity? It would be interesting to know in what official capacity Mr Burke was to attend this and other meetings in Romania. I say that in passing. What I really want to know is: what did it cost? Specifically, what was the purpose of it? What was achieved by the mission? I presume that Mr Burke reported to the Department on the achievements of the mission, as he was apparently doing it in the Australian Government's interests; and, if he did so report, I would ask the Minister whether he would table a copy of that report.

         â€”Let me say at the outset that I am indebted to Senator Hill for confining the compass of his questioning relatively narrowly because of the time constraints that do afflict the Committee in dealing with the Estimates as a whole. However, I will respond very quickly to a couple of his opening references to matters he is not now pursuing.

       <para>
        On the subject of leaks, I say again that I do take very seriously indeed the leaks that have occurred. I think the torrent seems to have been reduced to a trickle as a result of various steps that have been taken. That is not to say that trickles themselves cannot be damaging, and I do deplore the latest example which occurred earlier this week. I can only repeat the language I have used on other occasions, that we are doing our best, again, through such resources as are available to us to trace the source of this particular leak and ensure that it does not happen again.
       </para>
       <para>
        Leaking is something of an endemic phenomenon in government, as all of us on both sides of the chamber know. It is particularly a problem in the foreign affairs area where there are just so many documents that have a high level of classification and sensitivity across such an enormously varied range of subject areas and that cover so many parts of the Department and posts overseas. So it does become rather more difficult than in many other areas of government to keep this under control, but we are trying.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the subject of the human rights mission to China, I hope to be in a position within the next few days to make an announcement at least about the composition of the delegation that will be going and the time frame of the visit. Discussions are still proceeding with the Chinese Government about the details of the program, but I have every reason for confidence at this stage not only that the delegation will be seen as highly expert and highly credible but also that the degree of access that will be achieved will be such as to ensure that the mission does secure its objectives. I think it better to let specifics on this wait until a little more detail is to hand, but I hope to be at least in a position to announce the composition of the delegation before the end of this week.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the first of the queries that have now been raised about Mr Burke and his role as a representative of the Australian Government in relation to eastern European trade and commercial matters, the general character of that role has, I think, been amply described in previous exchanges in the Estimates Committee. But, as to the particular trip that was made to Geneva from 10 to 13 September 1988, the details that I am able to give Senator Hill at the moment are simply as follows.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although it was originally anticipated that there would be a meeting between Mr Burke, Mr Hancock and Soviet representatives on the subject of commercial prospects in eastern Europe, the intention of that meeting being to take advantage of Mr Burke's considerable expert experience and contacts in developing mineral sales in eastern Europe, in fact, for reasons that I am still not entirely clear about, the meeting with the Soviet representatives did not transpire. There was simply a detailed exchange between Mr Burke and Mr Hancock, which took the form of a detailed debriefing by Mr Hancock in relation to his discussions in Romania and Czechoslovakia, which had taken place previous to the meeting in Geneva. It was a debriefing on Mr Hancock's most recent discussions in Romania and Czechoslovakia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised that the substance of that debriefing, which contained, overwhelmingly, material of a commercially confidential character, was reported in detail by Mr Burke to Canberra in cables at the time and was taken into account in not only departmental data building but also departmental planning for potential activity in that area. So it was in the nature of a relatively straightforward and uncomplicated meeting of that kind. It remains the case that the only other visit that Mr Burke paid to eastern Europe was the one that has been the subject of detailed previous explanation.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the subject of cost, I am not sure that we have that information to hand. We should be able to get the information. I am certainly happy to supply it to Senator Hill as soon as possible. If someone could set that in train immediately, I would be grateful.

       </para>
       <para>
        I support that on the basis of a unanimous attitude by Estimates Committee B, which made the recommendation in its report and on behalf of which I move this proposed reference. The Committee believes that uncertainties and inconsistencies currently apply to the broadcasting of Estimates committee public proceedings. The Committee noted that the order of the Senate of 23 August 1990 allows individual committees to authorise broadcasting and determine the conditions by which such broadcasting of their proceedings may occur. The Senate agreed to this order following consideration by the Procedure Committee which dealt primarily with the broadcasting of standing committee proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since September 1990, some Estimates committees have authorised the broadcasting of their proceedings, but with differing conditions being applicable. There are no guidelines to determine which committee will actually be broadcast. Estimates Committee B therefore recommended that the Procedure Committee should examine the need to have a single authorisation and a uniform set of conditions to apply to all Estimates committees for the broadcasting, recording and rebroadcasting of their public proceedings.

         â€”My authorisation for Mr Burke to go to Geneva was simply based on a one-line reference in the submission to the effect that this was part and parcel of the role that was generally proposed. At the time of authorising the visit in question, I knew no more about it than that which I had previously conveyed to the Estimates Committee. It is only very recently, in the light of the subsequent scrutiny of all the various visits that it has come to my knowledge-and, indeed, the knowledge of the current desk officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade originally briefed me on this-that the visit to Geneva was much more limited in its scope than I had previously understood was intended to be the case.

         â€”No, they are essentially projects in Romania and Czechoslovakia, as I have indicated. I confess that I remain somewhat puzzled as to the intentions of the meetings with Soviet representatives. As it turns out, the meeting is perfectly self-explanatory. Mr Hancock and Mr Dowding, the then Western Australian Premier, had been together in Romania and eastern Europe. They were taking the opportunity afforded by this meeting which occurred in Geneva to fully debrief Mr Burke about what had flowed from those visits and about the various aspects of them which, in the judgment of Mr Hancock and Mr Dowding, could be helpfully pursued by some assistance at an Australian Commonwealth Government level utilising Mr Burke's experience. That was what actually happened. It was not in accordance with my, albeit somewhat attenuated, understanding of what was going to happen. But what did happen was perfectly consistent with the role that was envisaged for Mr Burke, which was the central thing that had been approved a few days earlier.

         â€”I think the Minister is suggesting that he was misled. It is interesting to note from the Minister's annotation in which he approved this visit that approval was given not only on the basis of the minute but also on the basis of a telephone call between him and Mr Burke. I do not know whether Mr Burke expanded upon the purpose of his visit to Geneva. Clearly, if we are interested in the Australian taxpayers' position, I would have thought Mr Hancock could have gone to Ireland to meet with Mr Burke to debrief him if that was to be the purpose of the meeting. On the face of the documents, it would appear that Mr Burke built a case for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that it was necessary for him to go to Geneva because of the presence there of certain relevant Soviet representatives. One must now doubt whether there was substance in that case.

        There is only one other issue. The Minister has given information on the visit by Ambassador Burke, as he then was, to Romania in April 1989 which, I concede, was undertaken with Australian officials. But I ask the Minister about another proposed visit of which we were unaware. Apparently, there was another visit to Romania proposed for July 1989 which failed to eventuate only because of illness. Who was to attend on that visit and what was the purpose of that proposed visit?

         â€”I am sorry; I simply do not have the information available as to that proposed visit in 1989. No doubt it would have been the subject, had it got closer to actual fruition, of detailed arrangements of the kind that occurred in the case of the earlier visit to Romania. I will do my best to find out and give Senator Hill an answer on that question, but I cannot do it on the basis of resources available to me at the moment.

        I make one further point about the Geneva visit. Senator Hill referred to my annotation on the submission to me of 6 September, which has been tabled previously, about my having had a telephone conversation with Mr Burke about this matter. I say clearly for the record that that telephone conversation, as I recall it, did not cover in any way the question of a visit to Geneva. It was about the larger concept of Mr Burke being involved in the role that is described in that particular memo. My only knowledge of the visit to Geneva was the one paragraph reference to that at the tail end of that submission to me, which said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Burke has sought approval to agree to a request from Mr Hancock that he join Mr Hancock in Geneva on 12 September for a meeting with Soviet representatives on various commercial prospects.

       <para>
        That was the sole extent of my knowledge about that. Whether the departmental statement was based on a departmental misunderstanding of what Mr Burke had proposed about that Geneva meeting or, rather, whether the concept of the meeting changed as it developed, I simply do not know. I do not have information about that and I suspect that it is probably lost in the mists.

Arising out of the Estimates, I ask the Minister whether the log of the calls has now been produced. You might remember, Mr Chairman, that an error occurred in the information given to Estimates Committee B. The Committee was first told that there was not a log and subsequently this was corrected. Has the log now been produced? Has it been delivered to Mr Burke, as Senator Evans said it would be, in order that Mr Burke might verify the proportion of the calls which were personal? Has the log been personally inspected by the Minister? Is the Minister satisfied that the claim by Mr Burke for personal calls is a fair assessment on the basis of the information contained in the log? Finally, has Mr Burke now confirmed, in accordance with the Minister's written request, that the 9.87 per cent of calls which he previously estimated were personal is accurate?

         â€”My understanding is this: the detailed call logs in question have been received by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade from the Irish authorities. That happened on 13 and 14 May. The logs in question relate to telephones, first, in the residence in Dublin, secondly, the telephone in Mr Burke's vehicle and, thirdly, his direct extension of a particular telephone in the chancery itself. We were not aware until very recently that a call log was also available for the private phone in the chancery.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The call logs in relation to all three of those telephones have been received and were sent to Mr Burke on 17 May under cover of a letter from the senior officer in the Department concerned, which letter asks Mr Burke for his assistance-with his memory now aided by these calls logs-in identifying which of the calls in question were official. Mr Burke has not yet replied to that, unsurprisingly, since it is only a few days ago. Obviously, quite a large exercise is involved in scrutinising the detail of this and determining whether his previous recollections were accurate and whether the contribution that was paid was an appropriate one. We expect, obviously, an answer from Mr Burke to these questions reasonably shortly, but we have not received it yet.

       <para>
        I have neither personally seen the log in question nor do I think it is appropriate that I see it. There is an entirely legitimate privacy issue involved in terms of access to this. What is important is that the procedure be a sound one and that we be confident that, in the final wash-up, an appropriate division has been made between the private and the official calls. I am devoting all my attention at the moment to ensure that a satisfactory process is adopted in this respect. The first step is to await Mr Burke's reply.

Presumably Senator Hill is talking about the document of 27 June 1990 in which it is said that payments by staff for personal telephone calls were based on a decision by the Ambassador that 10 per cent of the total cost of telephone calls would be attributable to personal use, and that it may not have been an appropriate basis for recovery of these costs.

Just going through the sequence of events, I think that the place to start is the review of practice so far as contributions were concerned that was made by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) in December 1989. The ANAO did not recommend that the payment practice in question be stopped. It did say that the rationale for setting the personal contribution rate at 10 per cent should be on file and that in future this matter should be more specifically addressed in precise terms and conditions for ambassadors to reflect the actual payment formula involved. As to getting the rationale on file, I am told that that was attended to very shortly after the Audit Office recommendations were received some time in January, or whenever, 1990.

        I believe that that particular letter has been tabled. At that stage I had regard only to the procedures involved. The matter did not go to quantum; it was just to ensure that Mr Burke was conscious of his obligations in this respect and did do things properly thereafter.

The reporting cable in question from Mr Burke arising out of his consultations in Geneva was repeated by us to relevant posts, namely Warsaw and Vienna- Warsaw because at that stage it was acting in relation to Czechoslovakia; Vienna because it was acting as the post in relation to Romania-I am sorry; Belgrade and Vienna-just Vienna because of the general brief in relation to eastern European matters generally. It was repeated to Warsaw, Belgrade and Vienna.

        The cable was not repeated to Moscow which does suggest that, despite the earlier expectation that representatives from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would be involved in the Geneva meeting, that did not, in fact, occur. There does not seem to be any further information that anyone can find as to why the Soviet representatives were not there, or as to the explanation for the submission having been put to me in the terms of Soviet representatives being expected to be there. They were not. In fact, it is quite possible that there was simply a misunderstanding about that because Mr Hancock's visit had been to Romania in relation to Czechoslovakia, not in relation to the Soviet Union, as such.

        I take this opportunity to correct an answer to Senate question on notice No. 588 which was asked of me by Senator Campbell on 10 April. The reply has been tabled, but I am not quite sure when. In response to Senator Campbell, there is a reference by me to the Ambassador having been absent overseas from the Dublin Embassy on a variety of dates. The first date relates to this Geneva visit in September 1988. The reference there is to Mr Burke having met with Mr Lang Hancock and Soviet representatives. Having just checked that information with the officer in question, I am advised that that answer was compiled on the basis of the expectation rather than on the reality. That is another unfortunate misstatement of a minor kind, but I hope the record has now been appropriately corrected. I am sorry to have interrupted.

As we have said on earlier occasions, that is partly explicable by the fact that there is a cross-accreditation to the Holy See. It is also partly explicable simply by variations in practice which occur quite naturally as between missions and the way in which they do business, particularly in terms of calls back to Australia and to the Department. The time zones are such that one would expect some categories of calls to be higher from these places than others; namely, calls of an official nature from the private residence.

         â€”As I recall the context, and I would hope that Senator Harradine recalls it as well, it was a kind of linguistic correction. One talks about political dissent as the right to contest political issues against the approved line from the Government of the day but, in relation to religious expression the main context in which one talks about freedom of religion is not so much the right to dissent but the right to exercise religious freedom without intolerance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If there were an established church which laid down all sorts of rules about what was permissible so far as the practice of religion was concerned in that country and what was impermissible dissent from the approved established church, the appropriate expression probably would be `religious dissent'. But if the context is essentially the Chinese one-and, as I understand it, the argument is about the right to practise one's religion-the appropriate terminology is probably `religious freedom'.
       </para>
       <para>
        If `religious dissent' is a more apt description in Senator Harradine's mind of what we are talking about here, then so be it. I am not intending to exclude any category of claim of right. It is simply a matter of a linguistic hiccup with my mentally correcting myself and thinking that in this context `religious freedom' is probably a more accurate expression as the appropriate religious counterpart to `political dissent'. If it is the case, as is perhaps it is in Tibet, for example, where essentially a political cry is being expressed through religious means, or in Burma, where so many Buddhist monks have been at the forefront of the campaign of resistance over the years to the military administration, that is not so much a matter of a claim of religious freedom or a right to exercise religious dissent; it is more a matter of political freedom or political dissent taking a religious institutional form. But, honestly, there was no significance to be attached to that distinction as I drew it in the course of that response.

       <para>
        The forthcoming visit to China of an Australian delegation to examine and discuss human rights in China will provide an opportunity to raise with the relevant Chinese authorities the cases of religious leaders allegedly held in detention and to discuss issues of religious freedom in China.

       <para>
        I would have thought that the word `allegedly' was not appropriate there, unless the Department is unclear as to the facts of the situation. Clearly, there are large numbers of religious leaders and, indeed, people who have attempted to express their religious freedom or their deeply held religious convictions within a spiritually based community who now find themselves in gaol, persecuted in one way or another. I would certainly like the Government to pursue these issues. I am sure what Senator Gareth Evans has said has now clarified the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Besides the issue of people being held in detention, which is most disconcerting, there are other aspects: the receiving of religious literature, the printing of religious literature in China, the refusal of permission to open novitiates, the control of seminaries, and a number of other issues such as permission for ordinations and the return of confiscated property. All these things do go to fundamental rights. I will be very interested to hear the Minister's announcement later this week about the visit, and I look forward to seeing how it is proposed that these issues will be tested. I assume that the Committee will just not accept being handed a copy of the Constitution or a statement by the appropriate Minister and leave it at that.

         â€”That is an entirely reasonable assumption. The composition of the delegation has been determined and, as I said earlier in response to Senator Hill, I hope to be in a position later this week to announce at least that. Whether I am in a position to announce much more than that so far as the actual detailed program is concerned is a little uncertain at this stage. It depends on some further communications with the Chinese authorities, obviously. However, the delegation is proposing to meet in Canberra at the end of this week to have a first session in terms of discussing the shape, structure and priority of issues to be pursued. There is no doubt that the issues that have been raised by Senator Harradine will be very much in their minds, along with a great many other issues, of course, in working out how the mission is to be best structured and pursued.

        I assure Senator Harradine that a high degree of assiduousness will be demonstrated in following through these things. Once he sees the composition of the delegation, he will be confident that we have the expertise and credibility to follow through these things. I do not underestimate the delicacy and difficulty of getting something like this off the ground. I hope we do not have too many exaggerated expectations about what the mission will be able to achieve.

        The object of the exercise, as I have said all along, essentially is to commence the process of dialogue, to make it clear that there is a very significant body of international opinion which feels very strongly that international principles and values are involved here. Perhaps it really is to be best regarded as the beginning of an ongoing process rather than something which will necessarily produce very spectacular results in itself. Having said all that, I hope that Senator Harradine will continue to be confident as further details come to light that this is a serious exercise which is being pursued with great seriousness and with a maximum possible effectiveness.

         â€”I refer to the statement made in Estimates Committee B on page 6, headed `Changes to Explanatory Notes-AIDAB', which says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        During questioning under program element 5.2.2 relating to a UNFPA aid project to strengthen the technical capacity of the Centre for Population Studies in the Ministry of Labour in Vietnam, the Committee was informed that the money defined in the Explanatory Notes as being for this particular project has subsequently been diverted to a different UNFPA project in Papua New Guinea and that AIDAB had been aware of this funding change since late February.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee regards this situation as unsatisfactory and advises AIDAB that when significant variations to the Explanatory Notes occur, replacement pages indicating these variations should be provided to the Committee in advance of the public hearings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee notes in this regard that the Department of Defence provided in advance of the hearings some replacement pages which identified minor typographical and computational errors.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to make a big thing of this. Obviously, it is just a foul-up on that aspect. That is the bad news. I will just leave that as it is for the record. I am sure it will not occur again.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did do the right thing by making a number of savings and, I suppose, theoretically, though not practically, in respect of some of these areas it did not have to present additional Estimates to the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously we would have found out about this post factum at the next Estimates committee and there would have been a hullabaloo if we had seen savings made in one area and the money sent to new projects here, there and everywhere. In the area of program budgeting, this is a problem: the question of the rights of parliament to exercise proper audit and control of taxpayers' expenditure on certain projects is not guaranteed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I compliment the Department for having the principles of democracy and parliamentary accountability at heart and for presenting this material. The Department would recall a particular instance when a certain amount of money went from one country to another. The Minister in charge at the particular time did not know about it. But those days are gone. Leaving aside the criticism that Estimates Committee B quite properly made-that we had before us a piece of paper telling us where expenditure was going in Vietnam when it was not going there at all-I reiterate that the Department should be congratulated on and encouraged in its obvious respect for the spirit of democracy and parliamentary accountability in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Estimates we were told of savings of around half a million dollars being transferred to particular areas. I ask the question: where should the priorities lie? If $500,000 of aid money is saved, what are the priority areas where that money should be placed? In this case the Department has placed it, in effect, largely in two areas of population control policy: one in Pakistan and one in Papua New Guinea. There are one or two other areas. I recall that last September I questioned the Minister at the Estimates Committee hearing on the savage cuts in funds to a food-for-work and reafforestation project in Ethiopia. At the time, the Minister stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the circumstances of the pressure the aid budget was under, we very regrettably had no choice but to terminate it. It was a good project.

       <para>
        If I had some more money, that is one of the first things I would reinstate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister had $500,000-not a great deal, but $500,000-and it did not go to this project. It went to population control programs, which I will come to shortly. I believe that we should be given an explanation.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I am indebted to Senator Harradine for the generosity of his comments about the Department's responsiveness to the democratic demands upon us to keep the Committee and the Parliament informed as to what has happened when programs are changed, to the extent we possibly can. I say again for the record that the particular matter that the Committee drew attention to was the subject of apology and explanation at the hearing itself.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The revised page recording the program change had been prepared in ample time within the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) but, as a result of a communication breakdown, it had not been forwarded to honourable senators as a replacement page before the hearing. Copies were circulated during the hearing and AIDAB apologised for that. It might have been nice if the Committee had been as generous as Senator Harradine in acknowledging the apology in the language of the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        Be that as it may, the more substantial question is the one that Senator Harradine raises about the reallocation of priorities. Let me put this into context by saying that, when one has an aid program involving the expenditure of something like $1.3 billion, as ours does, there are an enormous number of programs across an enormously wide spectrum, not all of which obviously fall out exactly within the time frames originally envisaged.
       </para>
       <para>
        The truth of the matter is that, in the last couple of months of any given financial year, up to around $20m worth of aid expenditure is reallocated, usually within particular identified programs but sometimes from one program category to another. The accounting for that is, of course, conveyed to the Senate Estimates Committee if this happens before the Estimates Committee meets. Otherwise it has to go into the final wrap-up accounts for the year, which are then subject to scrutiny in later processes.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in this case it was not a matter of having $500,000 fortuitously available because of the non-expenditure on the Vietnam population studies program this year. It was a matter of that $500,000 being part of a larger sum of nearly $20m, which was also being moved around at that stage. When money is moved around in this way it is not a matter of scrambling at the last minute to find some appropriately worthy cause to devote the money to. It is really just a matter of bringing forward further programs in the same subject area that are in a particular pipeline.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Papua New Guinea (PNG) program-I think this is true of the Pakistani one also-to which Senator Harradine referred, was very much intended to be the subject matter of expenditure in the next financial year. The money was able to be brought forward to fill the gap that was left by the Vietnam expenditure having to be, in effect, postponed. So this money was being spent within the policy commitment to doing useful things in the population area.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I referred to my wish that money become available to be able to restore the Ethiopian reafforestation program, which certainly remains my wish, because it was a good program, I was referring to an overall net increase in the Budget rather than money becoming fortuitously available as a result of programming problems of a familiar kind. That is, I hope, a full explanation of why things are as they are. I hope that Senator Harradine will appreciate the context in which this decision was accordingly made.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of the intrinsic merits of the population program as it applies to PNG, we have become increasingly concerned about the very high rate of population growth in PNG, which is throwing out a number of earlier calculations that were made not only by ourselves but also by the PNG Government about the future economic development of the country and restraint on resources, as well as employment, youth welfare and everything else. It is becoming a matter of quite important policy concern which does need addressing. We were pleased in that respect to be able to accelerate the priority with which this money was spent in population activities in PNG. I appreciate, as always, the sensitivity of this subject as far as Senator Harradine is concerned, but I hope he will understand the good faith in which this program has been implemented.

I hope my appraisal of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not been too effusive. The Minister said that there was shuffling around of perhaps $20m between programs. Does that mean between programs which have already been the subject of scrutiny by the Estimates Committee and the Parliament?

Sometimes it becomes apparent earlier than May-June-as was the case with the Vietnam program-that a particular program is not likely to be expended in that year for whatever reason. It is very often the case that it is not until towards the end of the year that it becomes obvious that there will be shortfalls of expenditure in some areas. We communicate as best as we possibly can to the Estimates Committee totally up-to-date information as to how the money is being expended between programs. If it happens after the Estimates Committee hearings then that accounting, as I said, really has to go into the next financial year's Estimates and does, of course, show up in the Forward Estimates documentation which honourable senators receive and debate in September-October or later.

At the present moment there are considerable demands for moneys in those particular areas, and I refer to the amounts required in Eritrea just to give an example. It is the Government's responsibility when money is shuffled around to make sure that, if there are savings from one project, it goes to another project that has the authorisation of, and has been subject to the scrutiny of, the Parliament. This particular matter had not been and that was the reason why, quite properly, the Department brought it to the Estimates Committee.

I have now been told that there was an agro-climatology project, the money was not able to be expended on that and was diverted to the Vietnam Centre for Population Studies.

I do not make any apology for finding the opportunity to do so as occasion arises. All of these things are fully reported to the Parliament and are subject to full scrutiny, not always before the event but certainly after the event.

That is a debate for some other time. What I am simply asking is, because the saving has been made from the agro-climatology aspect of the environmental aid budget, would it not have been more appropriate to give it to the Ethiopian project which was a food for work and reafforestation project?

        I will certainly chew on the Ethiopian matter, but there is a question whether we can just put small, bite-sized amounts of this kind in and out of programs of that kind or whether we stay committed to funding in a major and ongoing way. I am advised that, at the time of the agro-climatology initiative funds becoming available, there were no non-population projects suitable for funding in what was left of that particular financial year that had been identified and were readily able to be expended upon, whereas the other things were available in the way that I have indicated.

        I am aware of the fact that the money this Government is giving to the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), for example, is being used for institutional strengthening to support that particular view and that view only. There is a great deal of censorship going on in this whole area in academic circles. It is a tragedy that there is this sort of censorship, this institutional strengthening, where people get on this band wagon and keep on going. As the Minister knows, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and IPPF have a vested interest in keeping the money flowing.

        I raise only two other matters. On the proposed Vietnam project, the answers that I have received are on page 180. This is now no longer a project, but I simply raise this because the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau did say that it would examine factors indicating the success in the first stage. Yet the paper that we received from AIDAB said that the Vietnam project was a `successful project'. In response to my question as to what were the tests of success, AIDAB has indicated that it would examine what factors indicated success in the first stage.

        That to me is not adequate. I am aware of the difficulties of getting information from Vietnam, but it is not impossible to deduce what is going on in Vietnam. There are reports from time to time. In respect of this issue of human rights and population control in Vietnam, for example, there was a report by Reuters as far back as 22 November 1988. It goes as far back as November 1988. The report said:

        I wonder whether the Department has this material on file. Does it say that the project that it has been funding is successful? Has it tested that against human rights violations in that program or has it just accepted the view of UNFPA? Frankly, UNFPA does not impress me one bit.

Indeed, not only that but, on 8 April 1991, after the Chinese Communist Party General-Secretary had made statements clearly indicating the nature of the PRC population control program which makes it coercive, Nafis Sadik said that China `should feel proud of its achievements in effectively controlling the growth of its population'. That was said on the very same day.
       </para>
       <para>
        Incidentally, the day after that, Chinese Premier Li Peng said that, from the historical perspective, the measures adopted by the Chinese Government to quench the riots on 4 June 1989 had been proved correct. Does the Department take the word of UNFPA on this issue? Has it examined the consequent question of vio- lations of human rights in the Vietnam program, and what tests have been done as to the validity of what AIDAB calls a `successful program' in Vietnam?

         â€”I am not sure that I am able to add much by way of specific reply to Senator Harradine's concerns. All I can say in general terms is that, as I have made clear in previous Estimates hearings, I share his distaste for anything in the nature of coercion associated with these population programs in China, Vietnam or anywhere else. We have expressed that view very strongly to the UNFPA. I have no basis for believing that Madam Sadik and anyone else in the UNFPA are other than genuine in the way in which they respond to my expressions and, indeed, Senator Harradine's expressions in this respect. All I can say is that we will continue to monitor very carefully, as best we possibly can, the way in which these programs are implemented.

        As any new information comes to hand, we will do our best to test that information and to seek specific responses on it. I understand that we have been doing so in relation to Vietnam and we have, of course, been doing so in relation to China. We will further pursue some of those issues in relation to China in the course of the human rights delegation. This will have to be the subject of ongoing and careful scrutiny.

        I understand and appreciate Senator Harradine's interest in this. If he keeps drawing to my attention things that may have escaped me and the Department, I give the assurance that I will do my best, as will the Minister for Trade and Overseas Negotiations, Dr Blewett, to follow these things up and ensure that the principles that we both agree with are, in fact, applied in practice.

         â€”I am referring to the transfer of part of this money saved to a program proposed for Papua New Guinea and that program will rely heavily on the drug depo-provera. I point out to the Committee that the details given to us by the Department show clearly that the UNFPA has set targets for contraceptive acceptance of oral contraceptives, condoms and depo-provera from an estimated 6 per cent in 1989 to 35 per cent by 1995.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Depo-provera accounts for 63.3 per cent of the total funds to be spent on contraceptive purchases for women by the UNFPA for the PNG projects. This indicates that the UNFPA has decided that approximately six out of every 10 targeted women will use depo-provera. The use of depo-provera for contraception is not an approved indication in Australia and such use is investigational since there are unresolved questions relating to its safety for this indication.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here we have a drug which is not an approved indication for contraception purposes in Australia but which will be the key element in a program that we are supporting in Papua New Guinea. That to me is shameful. It opens the way for quite serious accusations against the Australian Government-accusations of cultural colonialism and racism. If the drug is not so approved in Australia, why do we support a UNFPA program for its use in Papua New Guinea? Depo-provera will be the major element of this program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department said that the project was well justified in terms of helping meet significant needs for better and more widely available maternal care. AIDAB said that it is estimated that 1,000 women die annually as a direct result of pregnancy and that the majority of these deaths could be avoided by the provision of adequate ante-natal and post-natal care. Can the Minister respond as to why-if the apparent focus of the project is on improving maternal health care-AIDAB has classified the project as an environmental program? I think Senator Knowles wants to intervene, and I am happy to accede to her.

         â€”I have some responses to what Senator Harradine has just been saying. I will get rid of those first of all because I do not want to leave the matter on the record with the misunderstanding that is apparently there. For a start, the Australian contribution to the Papua New Guinea (PNG) project of the UNFPA is at the moment going only towards salaries for people, in effect, to develop the program; it is not actually being used for the purchase of contraceptives. I think it is a $3m program. We have not been asked to fund it as such; it is just this particular bridging dimension of it. But, that having been said, clearly the program does need justification. It is focused on maternal health and it will provide contraceptives, including depo-provera. It is important to understand two things about the depo-provera aspect of the program. Firstly, it is not true to say, as Senator Harradine does, that six out of every 10 women in PNG targeted for contraceptive use will be supplied with depo-provera. There is a wide range of contraceptive options, including natural family planning methods. Couples are free to choose the most appropriate methods. Project inputs will be adjusted accordingly. The reason that depo-provera represents 60 per cent of the budget earmarked for contraceptive supplies is simply that it is so expensive. Injectable contraceptives are more expensive than other kinds.

         â€”Well, it is $348,000 out of $595,000, which is 20 per cent of $3m, which has been identified for contraceptive supplies. One cannot extrapolate from that that six out of every 10 women supplied with contraceptives will be using depo-provera. That simply does not follow from that particular arithmetic calculation. Depo-provera costs more per person.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second thing to say about depo-provera is that it should not be assumed that there is something inherently bad or wrong or inappropriate about it. Not only is it a family planning method presently offered by the PNG Department of Health, but also its use is approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a contraceptive option. The PNG Department of Health is following WHO guidelines which are internationally accepted in its own proposed application of the drug.
       </para>
       <para>
        Depo-provera is approved for use in over 80 industrial and developing countries, including Australia, where it is available under certain circumstances for defined indications. The Family Planning Federation of Australia and the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists believe that it is perfectly responsible and appropriate for medical practitioners to prescribe depo-provera in Australia in defined circumstances.

         â€”I have a few short questions which I was hoping I would have been able to ask immediately following Senator Hill's questions about the former Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Burke. I bring Senator Evans back to the question of Mr Burke's telephone bills. Given that they were so high in comparison with other posts around the world, particularly comparable posts in Europe, why was the figure of 10 per cent set for the personal level, considering that it is obviously so low? Did the Minister not have some suspicion when he saw the telephone bills coming through that they were excessively high and that that component may well have been made up of an excessively high number of personal phone calls, and that therefore the situation should have been reviewed?

         â€”I have said already in the Estimates Committee hearings and I think in the Senate that the questions of quantum-the actual dollars involved-were not put in front of me when I wrote to Mr Burke in August 1990. The question in issue was one of process rather than amount. I do not think anyone actually had regard to the actual dollar amounts-in particular, the relative size of the bills here as compared with other posts-until this matter became the subject of more detailed scrutiny earlier this year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The point essentially is that, under the devolved management strategies that we have been introducing-with a great deal of enthusiastic support from the honourable senator's side of politics-in the Public Service generally and within my Department in particular, questions of detailed administration and the allocation of budgets as between particular areas have been devolved to posts. The only time that the Department gets to second guess what posts are doing in this respect is when some claim is made for supplementation-when some claim is made that the particular administrative allocation that a post has been given is insufficient.
       </para>
       <para>
        That then sets in train a process of detailed scrutiny of just how the post has been spending the money and whether in fact the claim is legitimate, sensible or reasonable, given prevailing patterns of expenditure elsewhere. It is not a subject of minute scrutiny as long as no extra claim is being made against the original amounts that were allocated which, I might say, have been in increasingly short supply in recent years. It is getting tougher and tougher for posts to manage with their budgets.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised that there had been no cry of pain from the Dublin mission about its budget being inadequate for it to cope. So it simply had not been the subject of attention at this stage last year. Now that it is the subject of attention and it is apparent that those telephone costs for Dublin are very high, obviously I am seeking explanations; and that has been the point of my correspondence with Mr Burke and it is the point of the current exchange. It is why I am awaiting with almost as much interest as the honourable senator-perhaps not quite as much-Mr Burke's reply to see how it shapes up and to see whether the 10 per cent was in fact, for the benefit of the detail available in these logs, an appropriate rough rule of thumb calculation or whether it was astray. If it was astray, the honourable senator will have her explanation.

Therefore, it might be brought to the Minister's attention and might make it seem a bit odd to the Minister that the amount was so much higher than everywhere else.

An absolute army of people to second guess every item of expenditure that is incurred by those posts and to make comparative judgments about it simply does not exist. It is the case that the posts operate within a framework of detailed guidelines and regulations which are laid out in practice. It is the case that there is an internal audit program, quite apart from the Australian National Audit Office program, which operates in relation to those posts. If there are any irregularities in the procedures involved they will show up. I guess it tends to be inherent in the nature of audit proceedings that the focus is on process rather than quantum. As long as the process is accurate, audit people do not tend to make comparative judgments about amounts.

        Practice does vary enormously between posts as to the way in which they operate and between individuals as to the way in which they operate.

I repeat: the posts are operating within tight budgetary constraints and if they internally organise themselves consistent with proper procedures and practice so far as the auditors are concerned that is not something which you could reasonably expect to leap out at the financial administrators in Canberra unless and until some specific focus is placed upon it.

         â€”The honourable senator should remember-and I do not want to again track over everything that has been said-the two separate sides to it. The first is the question of illegality or impropriety. I make no judgments now, nor have I in the past, about that illegality or impropriety except to say that, if there was activity that involved active ongoing participation in political party affairs, it would be quite inappropriate for an ambassador to engage in that. Whether it is inappropriate to the point of requiring dismissal is another question and one that I have answered previously in this place. But it is manifestly inappropriate.

It is already well known-and I have said it in this place-that when it did become apparent that a series of issues about party political activity that needed to be further tested and discussed were now in the public domain this would require a lot of Mr Burke's time to be spent in Australia before the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in order to resolve the issue and would generate a degree of controversy which would be unhelpful in Ireland. Under those circumstances, the resignation option was entirely appropriate. We have been through all of that before and I really do not think I can add anything very useful to what I have said in this respect.

Given that that has happened in the past with Mr Burke in particular-that is not hearsay evidence, it is his own evidence that he avoided paying tax on the accounts that he was running-has the Minister, as Mr Burke's former boss, sought the assistance of Senator McMullan and Senator Beahan as to what they knew about the leader's account. Has he asked why the tax was not being paid on that account when they were very much involved with it-from Senator McMullan's point of view as National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, or whatever he was, and from Senator Beahan's point of view as State Secretary-to assure himself as to why no tax was paid on those accounts?

         â€”I have found figures that can prove that Senator Evans's information is misleading. First of all, I will go through what Senator Evans said. What he is saying is this, `We are just supplying a project coordinator and this is an amount for bridging finance'. The whole program has been assessed and approved by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. It did not adequately assess the issue of depo-provera and its implications.

       <para>
        The Minister knows as well as a number of others in this chamber that I am very careful in what I say, particularly when it comes to figures. It is from the information that his Department gave us-that is, Estimate Committee B and the chamber-that I arrived at my figure. In other words, the figures that his Department gave us indicate that UNFPA has decided that approximately six out of every 10 targeted women will use depo-provera. The Minister has come back with the answer that, no, that is not right because there will be a number of other contraceptives involved-condoms and oral contraceptives-as well as depo-provera. Let us agree to exclude condoms when we are talking about women and deal with the other two. The information I have from the UNFPA procurement office clearly does not support what the Minister has implied-I think he has even said it-which is that because depo-provera is substantially more expensive the basis of my calculations is wrong. According to the procurement office of the UNFPA, that is not correct.

         â€”The figures from the UNFPA procurement office show that, on the basis of dosage times unit cost, depo-provera costs around $US2.80 per year and that oral contraceptives cost around $US2.10 per year. Other estimates that were given to me have a lower figure for bulk purchase of depo-provera. I assert, based on information obtained by me, that the Government is to support a massive program in Papua New Guinea whose key, so far as the women are concerned, is a drug-depo-provera-which is not an approved indication for contraception in Australia.

        Another thing that Senator Evans mentioned is that there will also be the natural family planning method. From the information that has been given to me, I cannot see it stated anywhere that that method is to be part of the UNFPA program. It rarely is. The reason is that UNFPA is tied in with the drug companies. The Billings ovulation method has been proven as a culturally accepted and effective method of family planning in a number of trials, including recent successful Indian Council of Medical Research trials in India and Family Health International trials in Indonesia. Both of those organisations have views on population control which would not accord with mine. Yet trials have been done and the Billings ovulation method has been found to be culturally accepted and effective. So why are we supporting this particular program of UNFPA with its heavy reliance on depo-provera?

         â€”Quickly, I will give the figures again. The total project is costing $3m. The only component of it that Australia has been asked to contribute to is a bridging phase for consultation and development, which is at a cost of $265,000. We are not directly providing the contraceptives themselves, which are only 20 per cent of the total program, nor will we in the future. As I understand, this is as far as our contribution will go. But we support the program itself, and therefore it is a legitimate series of questions that Senator Harradine has asked.

       <para>
        As to the relative cost of depo-provera and the question about the number of women that are being targeted, the point I was simply making is that, of the total of $595,000 that has been earmarked at PNG's request for contraceptive supplies, $348,000 has been earmarked for injectable contraceptives- that is, depo-provera-which is roughly six-tenths of the total cost of the contraceptives involved. I am making the point that Senator Harradine cannot simply extrapolate from that financial calculation to make the assumption that six out of every 10 women are being targeted.

One can argue about the relative costs of it. I am told that while it is the case that the cost of depo-provera might be of the order of magnitude Senator Harradine has suggested over a year, the cost of condoms is obviously significantly less than that, depending, of course, on the degree of usage Senator Harradine--

That is an available method delivered through the women just as much as through the men. It depends on the particular cultures involved which is the most likely to be productive-or unproductive. For all the virtue of the Billings ovulation method, and while it may be culturally acceptable, to make it work with all the rigour, apparatus and conscientiousness that are involved in the back blocks of Enga or Mount Hagen is something that has to be taken into account by those administering these projects.

        One of the virtues, of course, of depo-provera is that it works for three months at a time. In an environment where there is an alarming series of developments so far as infant and maternal mortality rates are concerned-and that, let us come back to it, is the nub of the problem-the whole question of maternal health, including family planning, is a crucially important one to address. It is a matter for the judgment of the people concerned as to what the best way of doing it is in the environment in question. For all the anxiety that Senator Harradine may have about depo-provera as a contraceptive method, I can only repeat what I said earlier: it is one that is approved as a contraceptive option by the World Health Organisation. WHO has set guidelines and it is within those guidelines that PNG is operating.

       <para>
        I come back to the point that it was not on the simple mathematical calculation of the cost of the drug as provided to me by the Department. I went further and obtained from the UNFPA bulk procurement office the actual costs. That is what we are talking about; this group is running the program in Papua New Guinea. On the basis of those costs, compared with oral contraceptives, condoms do not come into it. It is a fact that approximately six out of 10 women will be targeted to use the drug depo-provera.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans might talk about what the World Health Organisation, which designed the PNG project, says. My concern has been expressed previously about the WHO's unethical approach to these questions of population control drugs and other measures. The WHO has a human reproduction program that is developing RU486, the abortion drug, and assisting in the development of an anti-HCG vaccine. That is the sort of ethics that Senator Evans is talking about so far as the WHO is concerned in these particular areas. Of course, in a large number of other areas the WHO is doing a marvellous job, but in this particular area its ethics are very questionable indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate that the former Director-General of the WHO, Halfdan Mahler-who, incidentally, now has gone over as head of IPPF, the International Planned Parenthood Federation-said as far back as 1983 that WHO's perceived neutrality made it `a most appropriate instrument to deal with an area as sensitive as that of family planning research'.
       </para>
       <para>
        What does that mean? What I am saying to the Minister is that we have no right to support a project which is heavily reliant on a drug which is not an approved indication for contraceptive purposes in Australia, and that is a very important issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        One comes finally to the last point, the nub of the question-maternal deaths. If the Minister's Department has advised him that the UNFPA project in PNG should be supported for that reason, it is on the wrong track. The great crying need, so far as maternal deaths in Papua New Guinea are concerned, is to have a widespread network of trained birth attendants and other persons who are trained to support women during pregnancy, at time of birth and after to ensure the good health of them and their children. In its documentation AIDAB says that 22 per cent of the estimated 1,000 maternal deaths at birth were from puerperal sepsis. That is a condition which is far more common in women having their first baby. Unless there is a hidden coercive agenda, the UNFPA project will not overcome maternal deaths among women with four or more children who are the targets for depo-provera, let alone those women having their first child.
       </para>
       <para>
        AIDAB has not done its homework on this issue. It has not looked at the situation and seen that there are crying needs in Papua New Guinea. I was the only backbencher of this Parliament to be invited to the opening of the new Papua New Guinea Parliament. I know a little about Papua New Guinea. I love the people there. But to have pushed on them a program, which is supported by our money, involving a drug that is not culturally accepted by them is wrong. I talked to women there in the health area; and it is not culturally acceptable. Half of them do not know what is happening and their husbands are concerned about the effect that it is having on their relationships and its ill effects on their wives.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask the Minister and his department to reconsider this issue and to have a good look at it, because I fear that, in the end, it will blow up in their faces. But worse than that, I fear that it will have adverse consequences so far as Papua New Guinean people are concerned. I also urge the Minister and AIDAB to have a look at the really important things that need to be done in respect of maternal health care in Papua New Guinea. If we are talking about maternal deaths and if that is the nub of the question, I ask the Minister to have a good look at it and rethink it.

To give an example, local councils seek access so as to know whether pensioners are entitled to Commonwealth fringe benefits, which is very often a determining factor as to whether they are entitled to the benefits that the local council might provide. My understanding is that the previous Minister gave a determination on that question, and I have never sought to alter it. Some State departments and some councils get access on that basis. To make it clear: that does not give them access to the personal details on the file, such as what beneficiaries are paid, where they live and how many people they live with; it confirms that they are eligible for benefits.

I am really appalled. I do not care whether the Department of Social Security sent it out or whether the Department of Roads and Transport sent it out; the point is that the recipients believe the Department of Roads and Transport sent it out because there is no indication in the letter that the information had not been supplied to the State Department of Roads and Transport.

I refer to the report that Australia has been `dragooned' by other Western countries into writing off almost $200m owed by Egypt for wheat sales. I ask the Minister whether he would explain what has in fact occurred in this regard. Will he, therefore, explain the circumstances of this write-off and how it is in Australia's national interests that such a write-off should occur in the light of our current economic circumstances? If this is the case, presumably Australian wheat farmers are to be in some way compensated for this loss. Would he explain to the Senate how this is going to occur?

         â€”It is the case that on 25 May creditor countries participating in the Paris Club, including Australia, agreed to reschedule a part of Egypt's debts in view of the difficulties faced by Egypt, particularly the effects of the Gulf crisis on the Egyptian economy. The Paris Club agreed to implement an extraordinary debt reduction equal to at least 50 per cent of the net present value of that part of Egypt's debts which were previously rescheduled in 1987.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a consequence, the Australian Government is obliged to reschedule eligible debts amounting to $280m over a 25-year period at a concessional interest rate that will result in an effective 50 per cent debt reduction. These debts were incurred by the Australian Government as a result of having underwritten credit sales of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board. The Australian Trade Commission and the Australian Wheat Board also have outstanding debts which will be affected by the Paris Club agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The assistance given to Egypt is conditional upon Egypt attaining economic adjustment targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Such adjustments by Egypt will enhance its ability to meet its substantial other debts to the Australian Wheat Board which were not, of course, affected by this rescheduling.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have participated in the Paris Club process because it does allow us to register our views. Were we to stand aside from the process, Egypt would not be able to give Australia more favourable terms than it gives to other creditor countries as this was a condition of their agreeing to provide debt relief.
       </para>
       <para>
        Basically, in short, we were locked into a process and we have to bear the consequences of it in the way that I have described. My note says, as I have already indicated, that this is in effect an underwriting by the Australian Government. My present assumption is certainly that it is the Government and the Budget that will be bearing the pain, not the wheat farmers.

         â€”The budgetary implications of the Egypt rescheduling are not completely clear at this stage as the detailed parameters of the Paris Club agreement with Egypt are still being calculated by the secretariat. But our own figuring prior to the Paris Club meeting suggested that there may be around $15m per annum payable from the Budget for the next three years-I presume that is in current dollar terms. We now expect that this may be a little bit lower than that. Thereafter, Budget payments could increase to $20m to $30m per annum and then decline progressively over the rescheduling period. My working assumption is that all of that is in current dollars. If there is any change to that, I will clarify the record later.

         â€”Mr President, in fact, they will make a significant contribution to it. The Australian National Line has been a pacesetter in introducing innovative reforms to Australian shipping services. I was in the fortunate position of being at a welcome home ceremony, I guess it could be called, just recently in Melbourne for the latest addition to the ANL fleet, its flagship the Australian Endeavour, the largest container vessel in the Australian fleet that conducts trade directly between Australia and Asia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        ANL was the first shipping company to introduce roll-on roll-off general cargo vessels to the Bass Strait trade in 1961. The line is still seeking further to improve services between the Australian mainland and Tasmania. ANL has done this by introducing two new high technology vessels to the trade, and I do thank Senator Sherry for raising this question because he has pursued the matter with me privately. These vessels are purpose designed and built specifically to meet the future requirements of Australian National Line's Bass Strait customers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Searoad Mersey is already in operation and is demonstrating the advantages of a revolutionary cargo handling system for the trade. This is based on the special use of steel pellets, or cassettes as they are called, which have the capacity to hold four 20-foot shipping containers or up to 69 tonnes of bulk commodities. The cassettes can be preloaded and positioned before the vessel arrives and then driven aboard using special hydraulic trucks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new system enables customers to present a range of non-homogenous cargo in a manner to suit the customer's needs while enabling ANL to deal with a diverse cargo mix without losing any of its handling efficiencies. The reduction in port time possible under the new system allows extended port coverage and will encourage further innovation in product handling.
       </para>
       <para>
        Next month a second vessel, the Searoad Tamar, will join the Bass Strait service. These vessels are part of ANL's investment in new ships and equipment to optimise the benefits flowing from the Government's shipping and waterfront reform programs. Both vessels are being manned with the new low crew levels achievable under the shipping reform program. The Searoad Mersey has a crew level of 14. The Searoad Tamar, which is a larger vessel, is expected to have a similarly low complement. It will replace the Bass Trader, which has a crew of 25.
       </para>
       <para>
        ANL is to be complimented for its investment in the future of Australian shipping. With these new ships, using the latest in technology and design and the low crew levels flowing from the shipping reform program, the line is delivering efficient, competitive services to customers in the Bass Strait trade.

        Currently the community consultation panel chaired by Mr Lansdown is undertaking its final stages of consultation with the community in Adelaide and other parts of Australia. This process will take a little longer to complete, concluding in a report to the Federal and South Australian governments in a couple of months time. One of the nine principles agreed to in the Commonwealth's agreement with all State governments about the MFP in 1987 was that it would not be financed through the provision of location-specific Commonwealth and State subsidies. Another was that the proposal would proceed to fruition only if it could attract private sector investment. These principles continue to govern the Federal Government's approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report of the management board, which has just been given to the Government, does not call for direct financial support or subsidies. However, it does recommend consideration of support through the application of existing policies and programs, such as the research and development incentive and other infrastructure support. The Government will be considering its support over the next few months in the light of the board's recommendations. Any decision on Commonwealth involvement will, of course, be taking into consideration the outcome of the community consultation process. I must say that a preliminary reading of the management board report, together with discussion of it in the press and elsewhere, enhances the importance of this project as one which has to be considered very seriously by governments at State and Federal levels.

        In November last year the Council agreed to a recommendation which supported the provision of acupuncture courses within the tertiary sector, but it decided that other recommendations, particularly a recommendation for registration of acupuncture practitioners, should be further considered by the health care committee at its next meeting. That committee did meet in late February this year and it is understood that it will recommend to the June session of the National Health and Medical Research Council that acupuncture practitioners should not be registered at this time. I understand that, in reaching this position, the health care committee was concerned that registration would not necessarily achieve improved safety and may imply recognition of the efficacy of acupuncture in treating a range of diseases not yet established by the evidence.

        The National Health and Medical Research Council has not yet adopted a position on the registration of acupuncture practitioners, and I do not believe that it would be appropriate for the Government to give a direction to the Council on this matter.

         â€”The Government certainly has not softened its approach to the problem of insider trading. In his question, Senator Beahan referred to it as `the insidious practice'. It certainly is one of those practices which disfigured and degraded the scene in companies and securities areas in Australia in the late 1980s and into 1990. I believe that the regime of penalties, for example, which will be attached to the newly-defined offence of insider trading, to be seen in the Bill to be introduced by the Attorney-General in the other place today or tomorrow, will very clearly indicate that this Government is most concerned that the Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people, should indicate that insider trading is an offence which should attract the harshest penalties to those individuals or corporations found to be involved in it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is true that there was a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report into insider trading, and the Government indicated that it would adopt most of its recommendations. The main policy issue that arose through public exposure of the recommendations of that Committee was how far the insider trading provisions should be amended to facilitate the prosecution of persons accused of having contravened those insider trading provisions. As you would know, Mr President, this chamber has always taken a particular interest in the question of the burden of proof; reversals of onus of proof. I see Senator Austin Lewis opposite nodding sagely as a previous Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances with a particular interest in this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contrary to the recommendations of the Committee, the exposure draft provisions had reversed the onus of proof in respect of a person's knowledge that information was inside information, as it was considered that this was a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. However, the point was made in a number of submissions on the exposure draft that the provisions went too far in lessening the basic protection given to the accused under the criminal law. Further, given the increased resources provided to law enforcement and the reported improvements in market surveillance by the Australian Stock Exchange, it was considered that a more cautious approach should be adopted at this time. Thus the exposure draft provisions have been modified to restore the onus of proof in respect of this element of the offence to the prosecution and now accords with the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. I believe that they were the unanimous recommendations of the House of Representatives Committee which, of course, included members of the Opposition. So the onus of proof will be borne by the prosecution in relation to these insider trading offences.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the insider trading provisions will continue to be monitored to see whether they are effective in preventing insider trading and in restoring investor confidence in the securities markets, which must remain the objective so that the securities markets can attract the investment which is required to ensure that commercial and trading life-business activity-in Australia is of such a kind that we can create the necessary wealth in the Australian community.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I refer Senator Richardson to the cheque for $968,841 meant for the Ravenshoe sawmill, which was paid to the wrong company. I also remind Senator Richardson that on 16 May he admitted to authorising this cheque. Given that the payment was recommended in December 1989, but audited accounts for the 1988-89 year were still outstanding the following January, what financial statements did the Minister see before he approved the payment? On what basis did Senator Richardson believe the payment would benefit the Ravenshoe people when National Associated Plywood, which received the cheque, owned a mill in Kyogle? Will Senator Richardson admit that with this one payment he cost the people of Ravenshoe almost a million dollars?

         â€”No, I will not admit that because that would be nonsense. When any Minister receives a recommendation from a department to make a payment, a brief is presented to the Minister as to why. On that occasion the company had requested that an advance payment be made. The Department examined that request; it had some advisers examine the request as well and decided that it ought to go ahead. That being the case, I was given a brief on it. I concurred on the basis of the information supplied to me that a payment should be made. I did not at any time agree to a payment being made to Timbertech. I agreed to the payment being made. I told Senator Boswell in answer to the last question that I talked to my former Department about this last week. I had a meeting with it on this very issue. I asked it to provide me with an answer and that answer will be here soon-I should imagine in the next few days. When it is here, I will present it to Senator O'Chee.

As to the tabling of documents, not just on this but on a whole lot of other requests for tabling of documents that Senator O'Chee has made, I will check with the Attorney-General's Department as to whether disclosure is a good idea-the problem being that I will not do anything to undermine the Commonwealth's legal position. To do so would be a betrayal of my duties and I just will not do it. In this saga I have sought the Attorney-General's advice on what I can and cannot table, as any Minister would do on any payment, and I shall continue to do that. I shall certainly ask the Attorney-General whether I am permitted to table any of these documents. I suspect, given the likely actions to take place over the next few months, that the answer will be no.

How much credence can be given to the Prime Minister's claim that he will not press for an expansion of the uranium industry at the Australian Labor Party (ALP) centenary conference in light of counter-claims reported in the Australian Financial Review on Monday, 28 May 1991 by the convenor of the Centre Left, Senator Beahan, that the issue is not dead yet? Has the Prime Minister seen the merit in the detailed arguments put by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and other environment and safe energy community groups, or is his changed stance merely a tactical move designed to take the heat out of this divisive issue? If the Government considers the present uranium policy illogical, when can we expect to see a new and clearer policy which will distinguish the Government's policy from that of the Opposition, which will go beyond the Opposition's policy of digging it up anyhow and the Centre Left's preferred position of digging it up carefully?

        Mr President, I suppose I could ask you to rule this question out of order because it really has nothing to do with my ministerial responsibilities or the Prime Minister's responsibilities. As is well known, the ALP has a national committee of inquiry into its uranium policy. There are a number of alternative suggestions in the conclusions of that committee. They will be considered at the national conference of the Labor Party and when that conference is over, the Government will be taking into account whether any change in Government policy is necessary or not.

         â€”I am sure Senator Walters had a great time yesterday without me. She should just keep quiet for a while. The Government's intentions are pretty clear. We recognise that there is a need to tackle the question of campaign costs and the relationship between political parties and the need for finance. We have done this with a two-legged approach. One, of course, is to provide for full disclosure of donations and other income and expenditure of political parties and third party organisations.

       <para>
        Secondly, we recognise, as has been recognised by a number of people in our community-even Mr Howard from the other side-that disclosure in itself is not enough. He alluded to the American situation, and that is good experience that disclosure and the implementation of disclosure legislation are not sufficient to stop the sorts of problems that we, on this side, are concerned about. We have already made it very clear that an important way to do that is to regulate, to the extent of banning, paid political advertising on electronic media. In coming to that conclusion as a response available to the Government appropriate in these circumstances, the Government has taken into consideration quite a number of factors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other thing that astounds me from the other side of the chamber is this new found respect or concern for human rights. It has been the other side, consistently for the best part of a decade, that has opposed in this place, in the House of Representatives and out in the community time after time Government proposals to protect human rights in this country. We have tried to do that by introducing legislation. We have tried to do that by amending the Constitution. It is the Opposition that, despite its latter-day, opportunistic conversion to the Human Rights Commission, still has a policy of abolishing that very same Commission that it is invoking to support some claim to being supporters of human rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does not understand the area. It has never understood the area. It has always opposed legitimate and appropriate mechanisms and responses to protect human rights even though those mechanisms and responses have sometimes come from bipartisan committees which included former Victorian Liberal premiers. Those sorts of responses have been opposed by the other side because it has absolutely no respect for human rights. If it knew about human rights, if it knew about the covenants that it is talking about and if it knew about freedom of speech, it would understand the Government's position full well.

         â€”I was just waiting while the bets were put as to the outcome. This question asked me whether the above mentioned is a fact. I can say that it is true that last year major parts of the New South Wales Government's industrial relations Bill were rebuffed by the Legislative Council and that, earlier this year, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Fahey, announced that he would break this Bill up into several bite size chunks and try to feed it through the upper House again.
        </para>

       <para>
        It is also true that late last year the New South Wales Government commenced a royal commission into the building industry, about which it was said by many commentators that it was created for the sole purpose of trying to dramatise anti-union sentiment in New South Wales and creating a climate of some crisis in the building industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also true, as a matter of fact, as anyone looking at the records of industrial disputation in Australia can see, that, on the table showing days lost through industrial disputes per 1,000 employees, New South Wales is the worst performing State in the Commonwealth and, in fact, drags the national average down because of that poor performance. Indeed, if it had performed like Labor States in the Commonwealth, the 60 per cent improvement of the Hawke period over the Fraser period would be even greater.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true as well, as this question implies, that Mr Greiner said before the election that he would regard this as a referendum on industrial relations and, on that basis, that he would re-present his legislation to the Legislative Council. In the event of the election, Bob Carr did not fall for it. The big election issue was not industrial relations but was, in fact, a State consumption tax. There is no doubt about what the electors of New South Wales thought about the possibility of a consumption tax. I am interested to see that, among others, Senator Knowles is now back-pedalling within the Liberal Party caucus on a consumption tax. While it is true that there was an attempt to beat up industrial relations as a political issue in New South Wales, to dramatise a period--

         â€”What is true is that there was, as it turned out, a pathetic effort in New South Wales to try to turn industrial relations into an election issue and acquire a mandate for an independent Liberal government on that subject. That sits uneasily and in strange counterpoint to the fact that Mr Greiner has been a leading advocate in Australia among the State Premiers of handing over industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth. Perhaps that is because deep down he recognises our better performance in this area.

        The Commonwealth welcomes any effort by the States to clothe us with greater powers on industrial relations. The New South Wales electors are entitled to reject, as they apparently have, any cynical attempts to manipulate industrial relations. It is about time conservative parties in this country learnt that the community rejects efforts to divide them on matters of industrial relations and supports efforts as epitomised by this Government to try to bring some coherence and rationality into the field of industrial relations.

         â€”In answering this question, I am reminded of a debate that was held in this place a few years ago. The then Liberal spokesman in this area made some points about international recognition of human rights. At that stage, we were discussing this Government's proposal once again to entrench in our legal structure, our political structure, the protection of human rights. That spokesman was not on his own. At the time, Senator Durack-from Senator Walters's side of the Parliament-said, `We will not join in any international covenant to bring human rights to everybody'. That is the position that those opposite have held. They have held it for such a long time. Senator Gareth Evans met that resistance when he tried to bring in constitutional changes to amend the Constitution to protect human rights.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If we stand so high on the international level in terms of the protection of human rights, it is not because of the actions of those on Senator Walters's side of the Parliament; it is because of the consistently good work done on this side. Senator Evans, Mr Bowen and others in the legal area have strived consistently to protect those human rights, and every time it has been argued against by the Opposition. We have argued for changes to the Constitution to entrench such basic principles as the right to trial by jury or the right to vote which those opposite went out and opposed. They cannot come in here now as born-again believers in human rights and run this line on me.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that what the Government is doing will in any way downgrade any position we have internationally. What will downgrade it is the policy of those opposite to abolish the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and their policy against human rights legislation. There is a great difference between the view on our side of Parliament and that on the other side. We have had years of introducing legislation to protect human rights. We have a respect for the mechanisms of human rights and for those who run them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this situation those opposite would not have had a Human Rights Commission; they would not even have talked to the Human Rights Commissioner. We have consulted with him. We are getting advice and that advice indicates that there is an obvious difference of opinion between our legal advisers and the Commission. No-one shies away from that. But, at the end of the day, the Government has made it very clear that we are acting within the advice and the advice is that we are acting within our international obligations. Senator Walters should not come in here, with her track record of filibustering to stop human rights legislation getting through this place, with a holier-than-thou attitude in this area.

         â€”Last week I had the opportunity to visit Newcastle and the factory of Anderson Rea Pty Ltd, which is a heavy engineering manufacturer in this country of underground mining equipment, and launch a case study of workplace reform which the Department of Industrial Relations is conducting with this company. I must say that it is an impressive operation. It has developed a teamwork approach in the workplace and has eradicated the old `them and us' attitude. The management has committed itself to working through a workplace consultative committee which comprises representatives of the employees. That is a very effective mechanism. It has been the key to changing the workplace culture and fashioning a new culture of cooperation which is now emerging. That is freely attributed to by the management of the company.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In 1986, this company employed 114 Australians; it now employs 170. They all produce much more now than they did then and the dramatic improvement, as I have said, is ascribed by management to the involvement of the work force in the company's operations through the consultative committee. That has meant greater job security for the workers and it has meant that they have achieved a great deal more job satisfaction.
       </para>
       <para>
        People in this company actually look forward to going to work every day. The tradesmen in this company are able to follow a project from the drawing board through to completion. Their job satisfaction is much more elevated. They also have access to a sophisticated in-house training scheme which enables them to be promoted along career paths. The accident levels in this company have fallen to their lowest ever. A number of new processes and innovations have been introduced into production, which have arisen from the consultative approach that management has taken with its work force. There are now no more demarcation disputes and work practice problems have also been removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a quite stunning achievement, but it is best illustrated by the commercial performance of this company. In 1986, Anderson Rea had 33 per cent of the market in Australia for the manufacture of long wall mining equipment-that is, underground equipment used basically in the coalmining industry. Mitsui in Japan and Eickhoss in Germany each had 33 per cent. By 1990, through this workplace change program, Anderson Rea had secured 50 per cent of the market, the Germans 27 per cent, and the Japanese 23 per cent. The expectation of outside observers and the company itself is that by the end of this year its market share will have gone up to 56 per cent, the German's market share will have gone down to 20 per cent and the Japanese down to 24 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an example of a company becoming more productive, producing a better quality item, introducing more innovation into its range of products, becoming more productive per employee and being a model for workplace change-in fact, a snapshot of the sort of cultural change this Government wants to introduce across industry in Australia. I commend the company, the managers and the workers. I trust that other companies will examine their experience more closely to see what can be achieved through the accord-type structure that we have been promoting in Australia.

        The suggestion for an international tribunal to identify Khmer Rouge leaders who should be barred from holding political office has some attractions in the abstract, but all the available evidence is that it is not an approach which is especially likely to prove practicable. It would be difficult to obtain the international agreement necessary to establish a tribunal and to have its findings accepted. It may be more practical to proceed by way of agreement, perhaps explicit in the text of the final settlement or by way of a less formal agreement on the basis that a more formal disqualification provision may not be achievable.

        This is one of the issues that will be the subject of discussion between the Cambodian parties and the Paris conference co-chairmen in Jakarta next week. I am in no doubt that it is an issue that will also need to be tackled in the final round of negotiations when the Paris conference is reconvened. We are conscious of its significance. Nobody wants to contemplate a situation where any of the more notorious associates of Pol Pot were to re-emerge on the public stage. Indeed, it is reasonable to work on the assumption that the United Nations and the governments-including Australia's-that are most immediately involved in this would find it extremely difficult, to the point of impossibility, to cooperate with a process which was belittled by the presence of candidates of such notoriety.

At the EPAC meeting at which that paper was discussed, Dr Blewett conceded that, if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Round failed, there would be a very real danger of growth and entrenchment of trading blocs around the world, and clearly to our detriment. Are not all our eggs in the one basket-that is, the success of the Uruguay Round? Why are we not looking at alternatives? Is there not a real chance that Australia will end up in the cold with our only trading partner being New Zealand?

         â€”I am sure at the outset I can say that we are all well aware of the urgent need to make Australia more competitive and every policy that we have been honing and putting in place in recent years has been directed at doing that in terms of domestic economic policy. The 12 March statement has made the most substantial possible contribution to that. So, too, of course, has the achievement of record low inflation figures which, in themselves, do more than any other conceivable outcome to lift our competitive game so far as domestic policy is concerned.

        The nub of Senator Lewis's question is, of course, about international trade policy. It remains our overwhelming objective to ensure multilateral international trade liberalisation. That remains overwhelmingly the desire of all the other major trading countries, including those within our own region. It is not to be assumed, accordingly, that even should the Uruguay Round-God forbid-fall in a hole again this year, there will necessarily be a headlong tumble into the creation of trading blocs, involving either the inclusion or the exclusion of Australia. There are many forces of sanity around the world that are going to be working very hard to resist that although it is, of course, going to be that much more difficult in the event that the Uruguay Round does fail and some of the instincts towards protectionism and managed trade do get a head of steam up as a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we are trying to do is not only focus our attention on bringing the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion but also to have in place a variety of other strategies both to supplement that and also to cope with a situation of potential failure. One is, of course, within our own region. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process should not be regarded as the prelude to some kind of trade bloc in the future but rather as a trade group which is strongly competitive and directed to freeing up the total international system.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the things that we are actively looking at within the APEC process at the moment is non-discriminatory regional trade liberalisation as a strategy separate and distinct from the Uruguay Round, which is focused in the first instance on the region, which includes both sides of the Pacific and which is designed to focus on particular areas where there are many trade restrictions within this area at the moment which desirably ought to be reduced and which sensibly could be reduced on a non-discriminatory basis but in such a way that the benefits would flow in the first instance to the region. This is a sophisticated strategy which is in the early stages of development. It is very actively being pursued within the APEC group at the moment and will be the subject of more detailed attention at the full ministerial level meeting in October.
       </para>
       <para>
        The suggestion that we are somehow neglecting bilateral trade relations while all this other multilateral activity is going on is completely ill-founded. We are extremely conscious of not only the market opportunities in the more traditional European and North American environments but, of course, the market opportunities that are dramatically opening up in our own region and conspicuously so in Indonesia. I have lost count of the number of times that I have spoken to business audiences in Australia about the potential that Indonesia in particular represents with 180 million people and already a middle class of some 10 million people but, more importantly than that, an emerging economic environment which is not only effective so far as macro-management is concerned but is increasingly becoming very much more attractive so far as micro-regulation is concerned-the removal of licensing and other restrictions which have traditionally been a major inhibitor to investment and other activity by Australian business.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is overwhelmingly obviously the area in which we ought to be focusing our attention. Austrade, in its new post-McKinsey strategy, is much more alertly focused on that in terms of bilateral intergovernmental negotiations to further smooth the way for entrepreneurial activity in this respect. We are being very active indeed.

        The other dimension of this news that is important and welcome is that it should help acceptance of the formal application of South Korea, the Republic of Korea (ROK), to join the United Nations, which formal application is expected later this year. Membership of the United Nations of both the DPRK and the ROK should also contribute in its own way to easing security concerns on the Korean peninsula. This would be very welcome not only to Australia but to the whole region.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth making the point finally, and just reinforcing the one I made earlier about assisting the application of the ROK, that applications from countries seeking to join the UN do require the support of nine members of the Security Council, with no veto by any of the Permanent Five, and the support also being required of two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly. There has been some fear that China would have vetoed, although it was manifestly reconsidering its position in recent months, an application by the ROK. Now that the DPRK-North Korea-has joined in, it does seem effectively beyond doubt that the applications of both of those countries will now go through. That is a very salutary result indeed.

         â€”My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs both in that capacity and as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health.

        Given the funding through the Department of Community Services and Health for women's shelters and the Government's attitude to abuse of women and children, and given that these shelters should be where women and children can get what they seek, namely, refuge from such abuse, will the Minister tell the Senate what action his Government has taken to ascertain the veracity of this allegation? Will the Minister also indicate what level of concern his Government has about the number of allegations of sexual abuse against children that are made, not when the parents are living together but rather when custody or access of children in a separation is contested by the father?

         â€”There is no doubt that abuse of children, whether it be physical violence or sexual abuse, or a combination of both, which would be particularly horrific, is a matter of great concern in our Australian community. I think it is fair to say that there is more awareness of the terrible deeds that are done by adults and perhaps those of teenage years against younger children in our community in this regard, although I am unable to say whether the practice has increased. There is certainly an awareness in the community that was not prevalent some years ago.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Indeed, it is a fact, as Senator Vanstone has indicated, that violence against children is one of the underlying causes of violence throughout the community and as expressed by those children as they move into their adult years. This was a finding of the National Committee on Violence in its report entitled Violence: Directions for Australia which indicated that the household, the home, which should be a refuge and haven from violence, was a place where children experience violence-`became a training ground for aggression' was the expression used in that report. Of course, that has implications for their development as human beings, and their non-violent relationships, which they should enter into with other human beings, become impaired, and resort to violence is something that they see as part of the normal upbringing and way of relating of human beings.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as sexual abuse is concerned, that is a particularly degrading form of abuse of children. It quite often impairs the ability of those children themselves to enter into reasonable and happy sexual relationships as they move into adult life. It is therefore something with which the whole community ought be greatly concerned-not only the Federal Government but also State governments within whose criminal jurisdictions such activity naturally falls and which also, I would imagine, would have an interest in the registration and the setting up of the refuges which Senator Vanstone referred to, which indeed should be refuges and not places where this abuse does occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am unable at the moment to say whether any particular action has been taken to follow up that newspaper report in relation to these terrible allegations. I will seek information from the Minister as to whether the Department is aware, as a result of its funding contribution, of the failure to adopt the highest practices in relation to the protection of children in these refuges and will provide Senator Vanstone with an answer as soon as possible.

No doubt some assistance could be gained from the Family Court of Australia and its counsellors and the records of that court in relation to applications that are made, for example, to vary custody and access arrangements on the basis of an allegation of abuse having been suffered by the children who are enjoying the access-or having the access, I should say, because they are certainly not enjoying it if they are being abused. Perhaps the best thing I can do, Mr President, is to ask the Department to see whether the Family Court of Australia or any other agency has some information which would bear on the question that Senator Vanstone has asked.

         â€”Senator Coulter yesterday asked me a question as the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories concerning a recent Army exercise at Jervis Bay. I answered the question in part and undertook to seek further information from the Minister. I am now able to provide that additional information. Following my response yesterday, the honourable senator has claimed that I misled the Senate. He alleges that I claimed that the Army exercise at Jervis Bay was confined to Murrays Beach on the south side of the Bay. The Hansard shows that I did not make such a claim. I gave Senator Coulter the information I had and undertook to get further information.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Yesterday I dealt specifically with that part of the Army exercise which was conducted at Murrays Beach in the Jervis Bay Territory, where the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories has responsibility and in respect of which he gave approval. The Army exercise was also conducted on Beecroft Peninsula on the northern side of the bay, but outside the Jervis Bay Territory. This is Commonwealth-owned land which is managed and controlled by the Department of Defence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised that Defence did do some temporary environmental damage on Beecroft Peninsula. I am also advised that no trees were cut down and no new tracks were bulldozed. The extent of the damage or whether the exercise on Beecroft Peninsular was called off as a result are matters which should be directed to the Minister for Defence.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was up to the Defence Department, in the case of Beecroft, to trigger the Environment Assessment (Impact of Propo- sals) Act and to refer information to the Australian Heritage Commission so that it can give consideration under section 30 of its Act. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories cannot trigger the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Defence Department is not obliged to trigger the Act or refer the matter to the Heritage Commission if it considers that the action proposed will have no significant effect on the National Estate. In the case of Beecroft, the Act was not triggered nor the matter referred to the Heritage Commission. Therefore, the environment Minister was not formally involved in the defence activities on Beecroft Peninsula.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised that the Minister for the environment has now asked the Australian Heritage Commission to develop a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Defence to determine the types of activities which should be referred to the Commission. I am also advised that the Department of Defence has now agreed to this process.
       </para>
       <para>
        I inform the honourable senator that the draft management strategy plan of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, to which he referred, concerns only the Jervis Bay Territory and does not embrace Beecroft Peninsula. The draft plan includes among its important objectives the conservation of the environmental values of the Territory which will be set out in the draft management plan for the Jervis Bay Territory nature reserve, to be released for public comment later in 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        In answer to the honourable senator's question about the Government's commitment to the protection of the environment at Jervis Bay, I am advised that the declaration of a marine park is a high priority. The Commonwealth has approached New South Wales in an endeavour to achieve a joint Commonwealth-State declaration of a Jervis Bay marine park.

       FUNDING OF HOSPITALS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA

        The answer read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The current public hospital funding arrangements, including the formula for distribution to the States and Territories, were discussed by Health Ministers and accepted at the 1988 Premiers' Conference. The arrangements apply to the period 1988-89 to 1992-93.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is incorrect to say that Commonwealth funding has declined. In 1988-89, the first year of the current arrangements, the Commonwealth hospital funding grant amounted to $273.7 million, in 1990-91 it will be in the vicinity of $325.2 million and estimated to be $373.4 million in 1992-93, the last year of the arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth funds for hospitals are distributed annually to the States and Territories on a per capita basis, weighted according to age and sex population profiles, to take account of the greater than average need of hospital services by aged persons and women. This method of distribution was developed by the Commonwealth as a means of ensuring equity in funding between the States and Territories.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore it is inappropriate to make comparisons on a straight per capita basis of levels of hospital funding between States and Territories.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should also point out that the hospital funding grants are included in the general distribution of Commonwealth monies to States through the Financial Assistance Grants. This latter process is undertaken annually at the Premiers' Conference and reflects the fiscal equalisation principles proposed by the Grants Commission and adopted by Premiers at the 1988 Conference.

       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the coroner's report, I am advised that the coroner was unable to come to any firm conclusion as to the cause of the accident, but did identify three contributory factors, namely:
       </para>
       <para>
        - inadequate training and the captain's inexperience on the MU-2
       </para>
       <para>
        - ice accretion on the aircraft
       </para>
       <para>
        - lack of adequate warning devices on the MU-2.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coroner was critical of the time taken by the CAA to impose additional training and experience for MU-2 pilots.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following an MU-2 accident in December 1988, the CAA sought information from overseas authorities and the MU-2 operators in an attempt to identify any special training or operational requirements. This approach culminated in a conference, delayed by the pilots' dispute, involving CAA, BASI and industry representatives on 28 November 1989 and an article reporting the conference was published in civil aviation news in January 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although agreement on training requirements was not reached at the conference, a number of detailed requirements on pilots were imposed in January 1990 immediately following the Meekatharra accident.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coroner was concerned that BASI and the CAA having an `interest' in the matter, were not truly independent advisers to the coroner. There is no doubting that BASI and CAA do have a vested interest in the outcome of any accident in determining the truth and that all coroners can expect support from both organisations and receive unbiased, factual evidence. It is clearly not unusual for the CAA to brief legal counsel.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coroner's suggestion that ice-detection devices be installed is being reviewed by the CAA in consultation with the original certificating authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        A final comment made by the coroner was that the interview techniques of two CAA staff were somewhat ``inexpert'' and the CAA has accepted this and is addressing the problem through its training processes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The CAA has noted that while the captain was not subject to the additional training now required on the aircraft, that he was more aware than most of the characteristics of the aircraft having been deeply involved as the superintendent of the BASI Perth Field Office, in the investigation of a MU-2 accident in December 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The CAA agrees that ice accretion was probably a contributing factor.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the third factor, the CAA has advised that the aircraft does not have ice warning devices, but is certificated for flight in icing conditions, and does have anti-icing equipment. This is an issue to which the CAA is giving further consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coroner also made some other comments in relation to his findings including that covered in Senator Panizza's question yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coroner suggests that this particular MU-2 (VH-MUA) got through the safety net as it had inadequate repairs of previous damage sustained overseas. The CAA has advised that the repair was assessed when this aircraft was brought into Australia and it was determined that the repair was adequate and the aircraft airworthy. A more detailed inspection would have required the repair to be dismantled and there were no indications to warrant such action.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coroner was also critical of one element of the industry for recording completed inspections which had not been done, leading to a recommendation that the CAA should scrutinise more closely the work practices of such organisations. Since the time of the accident the CAA has introduced the national surveillance system which improves the CAA's surveillance of the industry.

       In advising you last night in relation to questions asked by Senator Walters about the activities of the Australian Customs Service, I have provided you with incorrect information. In response to Senator Walters' question, I advised you that customs officers had not been on trips other than with respect to New Zealand and Antarctica. That is not the case. For some years, officers have officiated on cruise vessels from time to time when requested by shipping lines. Their attendance is directed towards facilitating disembarkation clearance processes at ports of arrival in Australia.

       I also advised you that the cost of the officers' salary was recouped from the shipping line. I have since established that this is not the case. The shipping lines meet the cost of accommodation, meals and costs associated with officers joining the vessels, for example, the officers' airfare to New Zealand to meet a vessel leaving for the Australian Antarctic Territory. But the Australian Customs Service meets salaried costs. I apologise to you and to the Senate for the inaccuracy of my advice.

       In a Liberal party-room post mortem on the New South Wales election, the Western Australian Senator Sue Knowles said it was increasingly more difficult to sell a policy on which details were not available.

       Senator Knowles' call for the early release of the consumption tax policy was supported by Senator Shirley Walters (Tas). She said she had issued a paper promising full details soon on the tax and people were now asking for them.

       They do not appear to believe consumption tax was a potent factor in the NSW reverse, and no one in the party room called for a backtrack on it. But concern has been heightened that the coalition cannot answer questions about the policy because details are not available.

       ``Will it cover food, clothing, medicine, medical services, dental services, haircuts, bus and taxi fares, building materials, etc?

       That is totally wrong and false. Anybody who knows me and my record on taxation knows that that is totally and utterly untrue. I have never supported a broad-based consumption tax, either in the form of a value added tax as brought in by the conservatives in Britain or the goods and services tax proposed by Dr Hewson. I have repeatedly attacked broad-based consumption taxes because they are unfair. I have attacked them for over 25 years. I have always believed that taxation should be based on the ability to pay. Those with the greatest ability should pay the most. Unlike Senator Kemp, Senator Short and Dr Hewson, who want to tax food and clothing, I reject such a tax totally and utterly.

       Of course, Senator Knowles was disorderly in her allegation against the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), but the truth is, Mr President, that if you look at Hansard you will see that the Minister was also highly disorderly within standing order 193. I know that Senator Cook speaks very rapidly and it is very difficult for you to interrupt a Minister and tell him to withdraw an allegation, but for Senator Cook to make his aside in the course of his answer about what Senator Knowles's views are on a particular matter is simply inviting this side of the chamber to erupt, and that happened today.

       Mr President, if you look at the Hansard for yesterday, 28 May 1991, you will find that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) made a similar aside in the course of one of his answers. I know that things are tight in a political chamber, but with all due respect to government Ministers, if they are going to try to dish it out in the way that their colleagues in the House of Representatives dish it out, they are going to get it back from this side of the chamber. The result will be disorder on both sides of the chamber which you may have great difficulty controlling.

         â€”Of the major problems posed by the Government's regulations, the most complex is the issue of retro- spectivity. It rises because of the uncertainty surrounding the law relevant to the offence of possessing a prohibited import of the type prescribed by the regulations. It has been argued, for example, by the New South Wales Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Mr Pickering, that the regulations could apply to firearms which were legally imported prior to the commencement of the regulations, although the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) has argued that the regulations will not have any retrospective operation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, has had some correspondence with the Minister for Justice on the question of the retrospective operation of the amended regulations. It appears that the advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is that the regulations will not have any retrospective effect. Initially, this advice relied heavily on the provisions of section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act which reflect the well-established presumption that legislation is not intended to have a retrospective operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        After a query from Mr Peacock about this advice, the Government obtained further counsel advice from the Federal Chief General Counsel. Differing opinions have been provided by the Crown Solicitor for New South Wales and the Federal Chief General Counsel. I am referring to that advice of the Chief General Counsel as the Minister's office has foreshadowed that it may be tabled, and he has provided a copy of it to Mr Peacock.
       </para>
       <para>
        The State Crown Solicitor's Office of the New South Wales Government has advised that the regulations may have retrospective effect. As I said, the Federal Chief General Counsel has offered conflicting advice. The issue is whether possession of goods which fall within the description of prohibited imports given by the amended regulations constitute an offence for the purpose of the Act, notwithstanding the fact that, at the time such goods were imported prior to the commencement of the amended regulations, they were permissible imports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The relevant legislation is the Customs Act 1901. Section 51 of that Act provides that goods, the importation of which is prohibited under section 50, are prohibited imports. Paragraph 233 (1) (d) provides that a person shall not unlawfully convey or have in his possession any prohibited imports and, under subsection 233 (2) it is unlawful for any person to convey or have in his possession without reasonable excuse, proof whereof shall lie upon him, any smuggled goods or prohibited imports.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is arguable that the combination of these sections effectively prohibits the possession of goods of any kind whose importation is prohibited under section 50 whether or not they have actually been imported. The Crown Solicitor for New South Wales concludes that section 233 (1) (d) and section 233 (2) of the Act can apply to prohibit possession of goods which are prohibited imports, irrespective of the place where the person in possession is found, the time of such possession in relation to the importation and the method of purchase of the goods. Whether it is an offence to possess a prohibited import where, at the time of importation, such goods were permissible imports will depend upon whether the provisions of paragraph 233 (1) (d) and subsection 233 (2) can be construed as excluding the general presumption against retrospectivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The courts have not being called upon to decide the meaning of prohibited imports within the context of the possession offences in paragraph 233 (1) (d) and subsection 233 (2). However, relevant comments have been made in related contexts. In the case of R v. Bull, 1971, 131 CLR at page 203, the High Court considered the expression `prohibited imports'. It was held that goods, the importation of which is prohibited by the Act, are prohibited imports regardless of their location and whether or not at the time they were so designated they have been wrongfully introduced into Australia. Mr Justice Stephen said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Goods the importation of which is so prohibited, by virtue of section 51, are prohibited imports and will, in my view, be so regardless of their location and whether or not they have already wrongfully been introduced into Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The phrase `prohibited imports' was again considered by the High Court in Milicevik v. Campbell, 1975, 132 CLR at page 307. It was held by the majority of the High Court that prohibited imports within the meaning of the relevant section are goods, the importation of which has been prohibited whether or not they have been imported.
       </para>
       <para>
        The courts have not yet had to consider a factual situation involving the possession of goods which were imported at a time when it was lawful to do so but, subsequent to importation, such goods have been prescribed as prohibited imports. Accordingly, the passages to which I have referred are admittedly by way of obiter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Chief General Counsel dismisses these arrangements on the grounds that the courts would read down the provisions to restrict their application, firstly, to goods which have actually been imported and, secondly, to goods which, at the time of importation, have actually been designated as prohibited imports. However, I point out that this makes the assumption that the courts will so read down the provisions. Even if the assumption is correct, this still shows that the state of the law is somewhat uncertain. It would seem that the law relating to the possession of prohibited imports is therefore very uncertain. Although the position is by no means clear, the following propositions can be extracted from the case law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, textual considerations of the drafting of the Act suggest that importation may not be a necessary element for an offence of possessing prohibited imports. Such a conclusion is also supported by the policy rationale behind the offences, namely, to remove such goods from the Australian community in the event that they pass the importation barrier.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, for these particular provisions in the Act to be constitutionally valid, as the Chief General Counsel intimates, it may be that they should be interpreted as applying to goods of overseas origin which have been imported. This interpretation, however, is at odds with the plain meaning that can be accorded to the provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, even if importation is a requisite element of the offence of possession of prohibited imports, it may not be necessary that at the time of the importation they be designated as prohibited imports. Textual and policy considerations tend to suggest that the presumption against retrospectivity has been rebutted. Whether it has in fact been rebutted will depend on the facts of any individual case, after balancing the injustice done to the individual concerned against the presumed intention of the legislature, as reflected in the policy rationale behind the provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition believes that this uncertainty should be resolved and the matter put beyond doubt by the inclusion of an express statement making it clear that the regulations will not have any retrospective effect. The issue has been the subject of a great deal of debate and correspondence, yet the Minister refuses to concede that there may be a problem. It is ironic that all this debate and discussion is in a sense needless, as the matter is very simply resolved by the inclusion of a short paragraph in the regulations to make it clear that they are not intended to have retrospective effect. The Opposition has proposed, in the alternative regulations which I have had incorporated, a simple amendment to clause 1.2 which removes this ambiguity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second major issue is of vital importance to sporting shooters in Australia. At a meeting in November 1990, the Police Ministers Council, with the exception of New South Wales, approved a statement about the importation of firearms. The statement provided that it would be lawful to import rifles and shotguns for competitive use in shooting competitions endorsed by certain recognised organisations such as the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia Inc. The regulations, in contrast to the police Ministers' statement, do not make provision for allowing the importation of firearms for competitive use. The regulations do, however, provide that competitors from other countries may bring in such firearms. This may disadvantage Australian sporting shooters and may well have a detrimental impact on the viability of Australia hosting international sporting competitions. In turn, this may impede the development of the shooting as a legitimate and internationally recognised competitive sport.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Rifle Association of Australia points out that a great percentage of its members use military-style rifles for the purpose of competition shooting and have done since the inception of the rifle clubs over 100 years ago. It is inevitable that confusion will arise. In fact, it has already arisen. For example, in September last year, the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia sought the advice of the Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr Beddall, as to whether an import permit was required for the importation of an AR15 semi-automatic rifle. Mr Beddall consulted the Australian Federal Police, on whom the Australian Customs Service depends for expert advice on firearms. They confirmed that the AR15 is a semi-automatic sporting rifle and that therefore an import permit is not required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier this month the Sporting Shooters Association sought the clarification of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs about the import of three specified firearms: the Colt Delta H-Bar target rifle, the Colt Sporter Match H-Bar heavy barrel target rifle, and the Springfield Armoury MIA National and Super Match rifles. The Association was advised that all three firearms are prohibited imports because they substantially duplicate military firearms in design, function or appearance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The irony is that the first two rifles mentioned-the Colt Delta H-bar target rifle and the Colt Sporter Match H-bar heavy barrel target rifle-are target versions of the AR15 which the Australian Federal Police and the Minister for Small Business and Customs say is a sporting rifle. Yet this confusion need not arise; it can easily be avoided by the inclusion of provisions such as those contained in the alternative regulations that we have produced and had incorporated. They make it clear that firearms which are to be imported for the sole purpose of use in lawful competition may be imported, notwithstanding the fact that they bear similarities to military firearms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats have raised the concern that the proposed exemption may be unworkable in the sense that, once imported, a firearm imported for competition could then be sold to a third party, who may then use it for other purposes. However, the problem may be overcome by the general law relating to the possession of prohibited imports. Under the exemption the firearm can be imported only on the condition that it is used in lawful sporting competition. If that condition is subsequently breached by a third party purchaser, the firearm would then assume prohibited import status.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is also concerned that the regulations may have an unwarranted adverse effect on legitimate collectors of firearms as military paraphernalia. Once again, this point is addressed in the Opposition's alternative regulations which provide for the importation of firearms where the sole purpose of the importation is arms and military collection.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, in our discussions with shooting organisations it became clear that, despite protestations to the contrary, the Government has not undertaken adequate consultations to ensure that the views of shooters were properly taken into account in the formulation of these regulations. In contrast, the Opposition has consulted and corresponded widely with a wide range of organisations about our alternative regulations. These organisations include: the National Rifle Association of Australia, the Arms and Militaria Collectors Association of New South Wales, the BHP Rifle Club Inc., the Firearms Safety Foundation Ltd, the Shooting Sports Council of Victoria, the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, the Armoury, the Australian Shooting Association Inc., the New South Wales Rifle Association and Movie Ordnance Queensland Pty Ltd.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to emphasise that the Opposition's proposed amendments are not intended to be inclusive. Other matters which merit further consideration have not been addressed completely in view of the time available and the restricted resources. For example, some issues would not become apparent in the absence of consultation with certain organisations. The Arms Collectors Guild of Queensland has brought to our attention its belief that the regulations are causing great difficulties to the film industry which is unable to import weapons props. This organisation works regularly with the overseas film industry and it reports that several proposed television series and films have not been proceeded with in Australia because of the problems with firearms importation. The organisation feels that the amended regulations will further hamper future film plans.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another company, Movie Ordnance Queensland, is the largest and longest established movie and film firearms hire business in Queensland. It is the supplier for the new Movieworld theme park on the Gold Coast. For several years it has been making representations to various Ministers regarding the prohibition upon the importation of restricted firearms for its blank fire conversions and application in movies and films. Under the existing regulations, it cannot import any pistol group firearms and any machine-gun, submachine-gun or the like or any military self-loading rifle. As it points out, considering the improving viability of the film industry here, the inability to obtain certain types of firearms, required by production works, works against the industry in Australia. The importation of parts and accessories for many of the firearms already held in stock would also be prohibited, which means that they cannot be serviced or repaired. All this reinforces the point that the full ramifications of the Government's regulations have not been thought through.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has given most serious consideration to the many matters raised by these regulations. Having consulted widely with the groups that will be needlessly adversely affected by the passage into law of these regulations, we have reluctantly come to the view that the only course of action open to us is to move for their disallowance. We could not move for amendment because of the fact that they are regulations. We are limited to disallowance and putting an alternative and better set of regulations to the Government, which is the course of action that we have adopted.
       </para>
       <para>
        We hope that the alternative regulations laid on the table and now incorporated will serve to show the Government that it is possible to produce legislation which not only serves the desired purpose of restricting the importation of firearms but also does so in a way which takes into account the individual rights of all those who will be affected. We hope that the Australian Democrats, who will ultimately decide on this issue, as I understand that the Government is not prepared to consider it further, will be convinced by what I would respectfully submit to them are very persuasive arguments.

         â€”The Australian Democrats agree that these regulations are not problem-free. I am sure the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) will also agree with that in a moment. We have discussed the regulations with those affected and with all those concerned in this chamber. We understand that the Minister will foreshadow amendments that the Government will be making to the regulations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am pleased that in a number of important areas the Minister's office has agreed that the regulations were faulty and that amendments would need to be made. As the Senate is aware, these regulations have their origins in last year's Police Ministers Council meeting where the Commonwealth and all States agreed to adopt new restrictions on the importation of firearms into Australia. Understandably, there was some general agreement that new regulations were necessary to tighten up the area of firearm importation into this country. In many ways this reflects increasing community concern over the spread of firearms and of firearm use in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats share those concerns and endorse attempts at the government level to improve regulatory control over firearm importation, which these regulations attempt to carry out. However, the Democrats also accept that the Government has a responsibility to introduce regulations that are fair and which do not have an unnecessarily adverse impact on any one sector of the community. With this in mind, we were initially concerned about several aspects of these regulations. I know that the Minister intends to address these concerns in the debate today.
       </para>
       <para>
        For instance, the Opposition has already claimed that the regulations carry an element of retrospectivity. However, it is my understanding that the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's Department, in considering this precise matter, has provided an opinion that the regulations carry no retrospectivity whatsoever. I thank the Minister's office for providing me with a copy of that advice in which the Chief General Counsel quite clearly states that there is no retrospective element contained within the regulations. I understand that the Minister will be tabling that advice in the Senate today.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter that most concerned the Democrats was the possible adverse impact which these regulations may have had on genuine sporting level competition in this country. A number of sporting shooters associations have approached my office in recent months to argue that these regulations would unfairly restrict a range of firearms currently used in sporting level competition. Certainly it would be unjust for these regulations to ban the importation of Olympic-style firearms, especially those firearms which are used at top level sporting competitions in the country. The Democrats were concerned to find that the regulations made no provision for allowing the importation of firearms for competitive use in sporting level competitions.

        Australia is a top level nation in this sport and the regulations may well have had an adverse impact on the sport by preventing the importation of these firearms. The Democrats have made it clear that we would not accept the regulations if they did not contain exemptions for those firearms used at this level of competition. I am pleased to say that the Minister has given us an assurance that these regulations will be amended to contain such exemptions. I understand that these changes will be presented to the Parliament within the next few weeks.

       <para>
        I look forward to these amendments as I am sure do a number of sporting shooters associations. I commend the Government for the good sense that it has shown in agreeing to amend the regulations when they contained such an obvious flaw. I ask the Minister to table the documents that he said he will. I ask him to stand by the assurances that he has also given to me in private. Under those circumstances, the Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's disallowance motion.

         â€”I will not be supporting the Opposition's disallowance motion. I would certainly support stronger and stricter guidelines being imposed on such imports as firearms. As a principle, I, too, am opposed in general to any element of retrospectivity. I am pleased to hear that the advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) deals with that issue.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I suspect that the Opposition's disallowance motion is largely fuelled by the gun lobby in Australia and Senator Hill quoted various shooting organisations, which bears that out. I do not believe that shooting is an activity that we want to promote. I certainly do not want to promote it at any level in any way in the Australian community. As we know, guns get into the wrong hands. They can lead to violence in the community. There are many examples-and I do not need to document them here-of people amassing a whole arsenal of weapons and then using them in a very detrimental fashion as far as the community is concerned. So I think the tighter the regulations are, the better.
       </para>
       <para>
        Shooting is hardly a sporting activity when we consider the real meaning of the word. Killing of any sort should not be seen as enjoyable. I cannot agree with the notion that we should encourage young people to get involved in this sport as though it is something laudable and enjoyable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not even want to encourage the collecting of military paraphernalia either-and this is another issue that Senator Hill addressed. Such an activity legitimises the notion that violence is acceptable, that war is acceptable, that war games and war paraphernalia can be fun. That is not the climate in which I want to raise my children. Of course, it is a different matter to say that we should ban these things altogether. That is not what the regulations are doing. But I think a tightening up of the regulations could certainly be in order.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, which is one of the bodies that Senator Hill quoted, indicated at its 1988 gun lobby conference some very worrying trends. At a training workshop it was concerned about how to get training into schools. A whole section was devoted to that. It was concerned about how to get young people in Australia to deal with and to learn about weapons. It was concerned with ways in which to get young people excited about firearms. In its 1988 training workshop manual, the Association said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Pupils should be reached as early as possible-both primary and post-primary education should be considered . . .

        It is very obvious that this is what the Association is trying to do.

        In the Sporting Shooter of July 1989, Ray Galea wrote:

       <para>
        If a child starts with a toy gun, safe-handling becomes a natural instinct. Mind you, these toys are difficult to find in children's gift stores these days because of a conspiracy to discourage young people from participating in gun sports.

        Really, if that is the aim of that organisation, I do not want to have anything to do with promoting that kind of activity. Further on in the same article, he stated:

        What kinds of attitudes is that activity engendering in our young people? We are being told that violence is okay, it is acceptable and it is fun. Well, it is not acceptable to a large percentage of the Australian community. He went on to say:

        The whole emphasis in an article in the August 1990 edition of the same magazine, written by Gerard McKie and entitled `Teach 'Em Young', was to get children at a young age to handle and become familiar and friendly with firearms. The President of the Sporting Shooters Association, Keith Tidswell, launched the most aggressive membership drive known to the organisation after a trip that he had made to the United States of America where he learnt, no doubt, lots of tricks of the trade from the powerful gun lobby in that country. He would have learned there something that will be very damaging to community attitudes in terms of what the various police Ministers around Australia are trying to do in respect of regulating and reducing the number of firearms in Australian homes and communities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The adherence by citizens of the United States to their constitutional right to bear arms results in gross homicide figures mainly involving the use of guns in domestic situations. I do not believe that we want to follow the United States example. Yet, here we have the national President of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia learning lots of tricks of the trade from the extremely powerful gun lobby in the United States. The Association is obviously trying to replicate that situation in this country. I do not think it should get any support whatsoever. The Association should be very carefully watched.

        The Firearms Safety Foundation Ltd is another organisation that has sprung up to do exactly the same sort of thing. I would like to quote from one of the Foundation's promotional pamphlets:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Firearms Safety Foundation Limited was established in 1988 to act as a funding body to various groups which were being organised around Australia because of the actions of anti-gun lobbyists. The original Foundation members, made up of several major importers and dealers-

       <para>
        of course, this is where the other sinister part comes in: the main objective of people is to make money out of this very negative so-called sport and entertainment industry-

       <para>
        quietly funded many fighting councils during their various struggles as law makers and politicians enacted changes in gun legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the Foundation's major activities `will include education of children through the Education Departments'. I think Ministers of education in every State need to take a personal responsibility to ensure that this promotion of gun shooting and gun toting does not get a foothold in our schools. It is not the kind of activity that we want to engender.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1990, after the outrageous displays of community violence in the streets of Melbourne-the Hoddle Street massacre, the Russell Street shooting and so on are examples of the misuse to which firearms can be put if they are not very strictly regulated; and even if they are, this could still happen-the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Mal Sandon, said that we should be:
       </para>
       <para>
        Looking to the training of future shooters, there are more than 250 schools which have shooting as part of their sports program . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge you to join a shooting club where you can improve your knowledge, understanding and enjoyment of firearms.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is what was written by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services. I challenge the whole ethos of promoting the use of firearms in our schools as being something enjoyable. It is just totally unacceptable on that ground alone.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us also look at the unacceptability of firearms on environmental grounds. The Sporting Shooters Association claims in some of its material that it is protecting the wildlife of Australia. This is a totally absurd situation. I would agree that it would be a sensible proposition if we are really concerned about the need to eliminate feral animals on environmental grounds. But this is a job that should be carried out under strict control by the departments of conservation and land management. It should not be left to so-called sporting shooters gun toting in the wild. If such people were allowed to shoot feral animals, they would also be responsible for environmental damage and they probably would take out a lot of native habitat species as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to quote figures provided by Wildlife Rescue in Victoria for just one episode of the duck hunting season in 1990. Animal welfare groups collected a total of 373 protected birds that were killed by duck shooters during the duck season-this would have been a minuscule part of the damage that was done-and the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands collected a total of 69 protected birds.
       </para>
       <para>
        A couple of issues arise from that. One is that duck shooters do not shoot only ducks. They shoot whatever moves. They are not very careful in their aiming. Maybe that is deliberate, maybe it is accidental. I do not know. Whether it is accidental or deliberate, the fact remains that many protected birds are killed during this barbarous duck shooting episode that still happens in some States of Australia. This is the kind of sport that we are meant to agree with, promote and to think is good fun.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also means, considering that the animal welfare groups collected 373 dead protected birds and the Government department collected 69, that the animal welfare groups were much more vigilant in their efforts. This would have been voluntary labour, people who are determined to eradicate this barbarous practice of opening fire on innocent birds in the duck shooting season. That is one aspect.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to mention also the former rifle range in Williamstown which is severely contaminated by lead shot. Not only is the wildlife at risk from so called sporting shooters, but also the land and the waterways are at risk. The Urban Land Authority bought a 111-hectare site from the Department of Defence. Before the housing project can be commenced on this former test rifle range, the Authority has to have a massive clean up of the lead shot which is situated in the mounds. For a long time this was used as a target area for the military, but it is the same sort of situation that occurs when sporting shooters at rifle ranges and so on perpetually pump lead into the soil. In relation to this site, an article in the Age newspaper of 16 August 1990 stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . rainwater soaking into the butts was steadily leaching lead into the bay, groundwater and a proposed flora and fauna reserve . . . plans to develop the land would have to be altered to treat the contaminated butts-
       </para>
       <para>
        lead being a highly contaminating substance which we do not want to see getting into our soil or into our water.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was also a 1989 report from South Australia on lead contamination associated with the South Australian Field and Game Club facilities at Cromer within the Mount Lofty Ranges watershed. The background to this inquiry was that a letter was received from Mr V.K. Mueller of Birdwood in late August 1987 expressing concern that sections 118 and 120 of Talunga were being polluted by lead shot.
       </para>
       <para>
        The toxicity of lead ought to be taken very seriously. It is persistent in the aquatic environment and is biologically accumulated. It is both acutely and chronically toxic to aquatic life and impacts upon animals and humans. The impacts on agriculture, which were discovered in this study, were that there was contamination of soil and pasture by high concentrations of lead, constituting a serious risk to grazing through the accidental ingestion of soil by the animals, and the oxidisation and transportation of lead into compounds which may be taken up by plants or mobilised with soil solution.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was also impact on the ground water. The soils in the area are generally acidic, with low salinity ground water occurring at about 1.5 millimetres. In addition, the land in question is a potential recharge area. In acid sandy soils the lead compounds are soluble and may be mobile in the soil and, therefore, it is likely that lead levels in the ground water will increase in the future. This is in the catchment area, the watershed area, in the Mount Lofty Ranges so it does have quite a lot of relevance for the water situation in South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        From the analysis of soil and water sample it can be concluded that there is extensive contamination of pasture and local dams; that the local sheep are absorbing lead, which may give rise to unacceptable lead levels in meat; and that environmental contamination, which is not extensive at this stage, is likely to get worse if this rifle range is allowed to continue operations. Water from two of the dams in the region must not be used for human consumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        On environmental grounds, I would say that it is very important that we look very closely at what the gun lobby in Australia is trying to do. I do not believe that we should be supporting so-called sports which have such a negative side effect, such as private arsenals, community violence, destruction of native habitat, soil and water contamination, no matter how careful the gun shooters are. In their literature, they certainly advocate responsible use of firearms. The point is that not all people are responsible, no matter how careful they are. I do not believe that we should be giving support to these kinds of so-called sporting activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am indebted to the Gun Control Association of Australia for some of this material. It recently organised a successful seminar concerning the accelerating development of the gun lobby in Australia and 20 organisations which were concerned with environmental matters, social justice issues, crime issues, peace issues and non-violence were represented at that seminar. I think that it is very important that these issues are put on the national agenda. On social, moral and environmental grounds, I will not be supporting the Opposition's disallowance motion.

         â€”The Government, of course, wishes to see the Senate support the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to do with the import of certain firearms to Australia. I believe that there have been indications from around the chamber that that support will be forthcoming and that the motion of disallowance moved by Senator Hill will be defeated.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to commend Senator Robert Hill for bringing on this motion. I do so quite sincerely because the temptation would have been for the Opposition to bring on this disallowance motion during the New South Wales election campaign. I believe that Senator Hill and other responsible members of the Opposition have taken the view that they did not want to be caught up with the grandstanding and the highly emotive campaigning undertaken by the Minister for Police in New South Wales, Mr Ted Pickering, concerning this particular issue. I do want to say, before I rebut the arguments put forward by Senator Hill, that I believe that he has acted very responsibly in that respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Pickering was going around the countryside creating fear and a real fur- ore, or at least he was attempting to whip up a frenzy amongst the gun owners of New South Wales by indicating to them that they could face prosecution for the possession of firearms which are prohibited by this regulation from being imported into Australia but which were in their lawful possession before 21 December 1990 when this regulation came into effect. He issued various press releases over the past several months to that effect and he has been campaigning around New South Wales during the election campaign trying to, as I say, whip up a frenzy equivalent to that which accompanied the previous State election campaign. It is now a matter of record, as one looks at the various election results, that that campaign by Mr Pickering was an abysmal failure. Yet it is true to say that, amongst some gun owners and their associations in New South Wales and elsewhere in Australia, there have been misgivings about these regulations, which it has been somewhat difficult to abate.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the question of retrospectivity, I think it is absolutely beyond doubt that the police Ministers in Australia, who have the cooperation of the customs Ministers in making these particular regulations, attempted to prevent the importation into Australia of a limited range of firearms, and I will name them. The regulations were framed on the basis of the police Ministers, excluding the one in New South Wales, advising the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) that the regulations should be drawn up so as to exclude the importation of a rifle or shotgun that is fitted with a readily detachable or folding stock, whether by design or modification, and most importantly, or a self-loading centre fire rifle or carbine that has been issued or used by a military authority or militia, or which substantially duplicates those weapons by design, function and/or appearance.
       </para>
       <para>
        What was happening was that firearms were being imported which had been designed for the sole purpose of killing other human beings, for use by the military or militia in other nations, or which were very closely based on those designs, substantially duplicating the appearance and design. It was thought by the police Ministers that, at the very least, Australian society should say that we do not need to import those sorts of weapons. Certainly, we do not need them to deal with the particular problems of feral animals, for example, when farmers and those involved in the eradication campaigns which are quite properly undertaken need to use quite powerful firearms to carry out the culling and the killing of animals regarded as nuisance or vermin in regard to the farming and agricultural pursuits undertaken in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most interesting aspects of this whole attempt to prevent the importing of this restricted category of weapons has been the very firm support of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Marshall Perron. I guess there are more hunters and recreational shooters dealing with wild animals in the Northern Territory than, for example, in urban Sydney, Melbourne or even Tasmania, yet Mr Perron was very strongly in support of this particular ban. But neither he nor any other police Minister would be in support of any attempt to make this ban apply somehow retrospectively so as to permit Customs officers to seize weapons being held in farms or houses around Australia that had already been lawfully imported. There is no intention and no possible effect in the wording of this regulation to allow for the banging down of doors of farmhouses or other dwellings around Australia to seize weapons which were lawfully in the possession of people under State or Territory law prior to the coming into being of this regulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true that certain opinions were sought, apparently by Mr Pickering, from the New South Wales Assistant State Crown Solicitor. Certainly the copy provided to us of that advice does not take the position that the legislation operates retrospectively. It answers completely different questions from those which are said to have been put to him before his answer. Of course, it is an offence to possess a prohibited import if the weapon was imported after 21 December 1990. That is the question which he answered affirmatively. What he was not asked was: does the regulation make the possession of a firearm imported before 21 December illegal? The answer to that must be no.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyway, the Chief General Counsel has provided an opinion. Senator Vicki Bourne of the Australian Democrats has asked whether I will table that particular opinion, and I certainly do so. The questions asked of counsel were:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) Does s.233 (1) (d) of the Customs Act 1901 apply to the possession in Australia of goods that have never been imported?
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) Does s.233 (1) (d) apply to the possession in Australia of imported goods that are `prohibited imports' at the time of the possession but were not `prohibited imports' at the time of importation?
       </para>
       <para>
        He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer to each of these questions is clearly `No'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reasons for that are outlined. I table that opinion. There is no doubt that, in the opinion of the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's Department, there is no retrospective operation of these particular amending regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, it would be plain to honourable senators that there is no need to include an express statement that the regulations are not retrospective. To do so would bring into question other legislation and effectively erode what is currently a clear presumption against retrospectivity. I think Senator Hill would recognise that there is a danger in, as he says, simply clarifying the matter or making explicit what is claimed by us, because it could throw into question the presumption which we say applies to all other instances where import regulations are amended and where a new list of goods is prohibited.
       </para>
       <para>
        We want to make it abundantly clear that, in all those cases, in the absence of some very express wording, there is no retrospective application of the regulation. There is a clear presumption against retrospectivity which applies in this case. Indeed, it is of interest that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances itself put in a holding notice of a motion to disallow this regulation. Amongst other grounds mentioned by Senator Patricia Giles, the Chairperson of that Committee, was the problem of retrospectivity. That Committee received a response from the Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr Beddall, which attached the Chief General Counsel's opinion and affirmed that there was no retrospective application of these regulations. That must have satisfied that Committee, because it withdrew its notice of motion for disallowance. Naturally, that Committee has members of the Liberal and National Opposition coalition on it, and they were obviously satisfied by that explanation, or at least the Committee-that is as much as I can say-was satisfied by that explanation.

It is not retrospective in any way, shape or form. I want to give that absolute assurance that Senator Reid has so rightly sought.

        It would be wrong for anybody who has any good in his or her possession, quite lawfully under State law, suddenly to find that it could be seized by Customs officers, or in some other way made unlawful, simply because from a particular date the importation of those goods is made unlawful. For those reasons, I ask the Senate to accept-as obviously did its own Regulations and Ordinances Committee-that there is no retrospectivity involved in these regulations. To emphasise that or simply to state it for clarification, as Senator Hill suggests, would have a very damaging effect on the general presumption against retrospectivity which must apply to all legislation, as reinforced by the Acts Interpretation Act, but particularly in regard to Customs regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the competitive use of firearms is concerned, I emphasise that the regulations as drafted certainly reflect the intention of the Australian Police Ministers Council that the various responsible shooting organisations around Australia ought to have a very prominent and decisive role in indicating which firearms might be properly imported for competitive use but also for hunting and recreational use. But we will not permit the importation of military or military style semi-automatics for competitive use. They are completely out of bounds. That has to be made absolutely clear. We are not going to allow in the military style firearms, which are designed to kill other human beings for use by various militias such as the Red Army, or the Chinese military look-alikes which have been imported in great numbers into New South Wales prior to the passage of this particular regulation. We are not going to make any concessions there.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one reads the regulation, one finds that such bodies as the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia Inc., the Amateur Pistol Shooting Union of Australia, the International Practical Shooting Confederation, the International Handguns Metallic Silhouette Association, the Australian Shooting Association, the Australian Clay Target Association Inc., the National Rifle Association of Australia, the Field and Game Federation of Australia, the Australian Small Bore and Air Rifle Association and so on are given an enhanced role such that, if those organisations endorse a particular firearm as acceptable for competitive use in their various disciplines and events, that hand gun, rifle or shotgun will be permitted to be imported into Australia. So it can be seen that there has been an incredible deference to those organisations and the role which they should play.

         â€”Senator Hill was making the point that some of these firearms that are sought to be imported for competitive use are modelled on military style semi-automatics and that, simply because they duplicate that military style weapon, that should be enough to exclude their being imported. In trying to change the way in which the Australian society deals with weapons, and in part in response to the report of the National Committee on Violence, the Australian Police Ministers have set down as clearly as they can that those weapons based on those military style weapons ought to be excluded from our community but that all other firearms with competitive and target type uses ought to be recognised and endorsed and the particular weapons permitted to be imported, although they are then subject to State or Territory law regulating the possession or use of the particular firearm.

       <para>
        There was a very high level of consultation. I will not accept the constant refrain that the Federal Government did not indulge in a sufficient round of consultation with these particular organisations. I met several times with personnel from these organisations, including a very long afternoon in Adelaide when we met with several of the leading personnel from a range of three or four different organisations in what might be loosely termed the gun lobby. As a result of listening to them, several amendments were made to the proposal taken to the Australian Police Ministers Council meeting in Alice Springs later in the year. So we were not only listening but also responding in a very positive way to their representations in order to try to come to as much common ground as possible in restricting the importation of firearms.
       </para>
       <para>
        In drawing up the regulation, I believe that the Australian Shooting Association, of which Mr Tamblyn is the National Executive Director, has pointed to a particular matter where the regulation does need some changing and some remedying. That is that the regulations as presently drafted provide overseas competitors with an exemption from safety testing requirements when they bring into Australia a firearm for the purpose of a competition. The Government recognises that weapons used in competition are too delicate to be exposed to standard testing procedures-for example, the drop test-and that the testing would have limited utility for this class of firearm, bearing in mind the skills of the competitors and the purpose for which they are imported.
       </para>
       <para>
        Exemption does not apply to similar firearms which have been taken out of Australia or purchased overseas by Australian competitors. That is certainly an anomaly and steps are being taken urgently to amend the regulations so as to reinstate the position of the testing of competitive firearms which existed prior to 21 December 1990. I wrote yesterday to Mr Tamblyn to acquaint him of that particular fact. It is a very legitimate matter and I am sorry that, in the drafting of the regulation, that was not attended to as accurately as it ought to have been.

         â€”No, not tighten that. In fact, by the amendment that I have indicated to Mr Tamblyn, we will permit the easier importing of certain firearms for competitive use. At the moment, when they are brought in, they must be subjected to a certain test which, given the delicacy of the particular weapons, is totally unsuitable and ought not to be undertaken. I recognise that and am trying to help the competitive and sporting shooters in that regard.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That probably deals with the major matters brought to the attention of the Senate by Senator Hill. I have indicated that an amendment will be forthcoming shortly as a result of the letter received from Mr Tamblyn but, apart from that, I believe that the regulation does what the Australian Police Ministers Council thought ought to be done and which I believe has very widespread public support.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was evidenced by the New South Wales election where in this particular matter responsible shooters, whether competitive, sporting, recreational or hunting, were not beguiled or seduced by Mr Pickering in his attempt to relive the campaign of three years ago when there was a frenzied attempt to generate a tremendous amount of hysteria from the gun owners of New South Wales in particular, but Australia-wide, about the attempt by government to regulate the possession and use of firearms in our community. All this regulation does is prevent the import of a very restricted class of firearm which would prevent the accumulation within the Australian community of firearms designed basically to kill other human beings.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that that is a very simple proposition which commands the support of the great majority of Australians. In my conversations and to my knowledge, most of those who possess firearms in our community see no reason for these particular firearms to be in our community. Indeed, as I say, my strongest supporter on the Australian Police Ministers Council in this regard has been Mr Marshall Perron, Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who is of a completely different political colouring and responsible for a community where one might think there would be an attitude that almost any weapon would be satisfactory, suitable and proper to hold, given the particular indigenous and imported wild animals and beasts which a person in that Territory might face.
       </para>
       <para>
        As in the case of all other Police Ministers, apart from Mr Pickering in New South Wales, the Chief Minister has recognised that we have to try to assist Australian society to change some of its attitudes with regard to the ownership, possession and use of firearms in our community. This change is part of a wider attempt-and there are many facets to it-to create a less violent Australia, an Australia where terrible massacres and deaths cannot occur, either in group situations or where someone is the individual victim of a person with one of these terrible weapons. We are trying to modify, ameliorate and change the culture which allows these firearms to be used in these terrible ways. It is only a small step, but one which I believe has the support of the Australian community. I hope that the regulation has the support of the chamber and that the motion for disallowance is rejected.

         â€”Much of what the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) said this afternoon would lead anyone listening to believe that he ought to withdraw the regulations presently before the Senate and come back when they have been redrafted to include those things which ought to be included and which the Minister and the Australian Democrats have admitted ought to be included. The Australian Democrats referred to the regulations as being not problem-free. We are dealing with a regulation that the Opposition has moved to disallow-that is, the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 460, made under the Customs Act 1901. It arises from the statement made by the Minister on 22 November 1990 that there would be a restriction on the importation of firearms. It was referred to by the Minister as `a positive generic statement on permitted imports'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When I read the regulations, it looked to me as though they had been drafted by the Government to appear as though it was doing something about violence without adequately looking at the situation to ensure that it was achieving it. As a consequence of the Minister's announcement on 22 November 1990, the regulations were made on 19 December 1990, less than four weeks later, which indicates the extent to which they were rushed through. Every honourable senator knows how long it usually takes to get legislation into the Parliament from the time it is decided upon. Look at the number of Bills that have been on the Notice Paper for weeks and weeks. There is still no sign of the legislation. It was announced in a statement by the Minister on 22 November, and on 19 December 1990 regulations were made to prohibit the importation of all firearms other than specified exempt firearms.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe the Minister has rebutted the arguments that Senator Hill put when he spoke initially in support of the disallowance motion. The Minister did deal with the question of retrospectivity. He denied that there was any question of retrospectivity. I do not accept that the argument has been laid to rest, as he seeks; I think it is debatable. However, I was pleased to have the Minister's assurance that there would be no prosecution of anybody who presently has one of the firearms which in future will be outlawed and that the firearm cannot be seized.
       </para>
       <para>
        Undoubtedly some firearms should be banned; we are not arguing against that. There is no question about the need to control violence in our society. But just bringing in regulations such as these does not go to the heart of the matter. Is it really so long since the Minister practised law that he has forgotten how difficult it is to advise clients and how much more expensive it is for clients when a Minister brings in regulations and has to admit that he has to make changes to them? Any legislation that is changed time after time becomes more complex and is likely to be misinterpreted. It is certainly more expensive for clients being advised on its implications. Knowing there is an inquiry by this Parliament into the cost of justice, the Minister should withdraw these regulations for as many weeks as it takes to bring them back in a way which sets it beyond doubt what he is trying to do. For that reason alone the Minister should defer bringing them in today.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have heard about the implications of the regulations on sporting shooters. There are many eminent shooters in this country who have done extremely well with their shooting and it is most unfortunate that aspersions have been cast at them. We are talking about allowing legitimate sporting competitions to continue and not be outlawed. For example, the Palma match would no longer be able to be held in Australia. Australia would be not be able to host International Practical Shooting Confederation rifle matches. Has the Minister contemplated the fact that that is what he will achieve?
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of collectors has been referred to. Collectors are willing to make compromises in their interests and community safety by, for example, deactivating dangerous types of arms such as machine-guns; but these regulations absolutely prohibit the importation of such arms. It has already been said that the legislation is difficult to meld with State requirements. It is arbitrary; it is impractical.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does the Minister realise there are only four types of rifle produced that have a detachable magazine limit of only five rounds or less? These cost between $850 and $1,450 each. They are unsuited to competition, are of little interest to collectors and are very expensive for use by primary producers for vermin eradication. Primary producers are denied access to economical arms for feral pest destruction. Has the Minister looked at that aspect? It is arbitrary to change the regulations so that only semi-automatic rifles with more than five rounds are to be prohibited absolutely. Also, it seems that there is no intention to prohibit the importation of parts that can be used to make a firearm capable of the functions that are prohibited in fully imported weapons. Has the Minister looked at that aspect? Is that going to require another change to the regulations later?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia has put forward alternative proposals. I shall look closely at whether the Minister has met the suggestions put forward by the Association. I dealt with the question of retrospectivity previously. The Minister ought to look again at regulation 4.4.1, which allows no discretion or avenue of appeal. This is particularly important, given that the Minister has given State and Federal police the final say on listing which firearms can be imported. There is no avenue of appeal from that at all. Has the Minister had the time to analyse these regulations in the way that they should be? It is surely a denial of justice for the Minister to give to the police the final say on listing which firearms can be imported and not allow any appeal. I cannot believe that that is what the Minister is doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation contributes nothing towards public safety, which is what most people in the community would hope the Minister would be doing. The answer to reducing violence in the community lies in part in prohibiting certain weapons. It lies more with education of the community, not with discriminatory legislation of this kind. It is estimated that there are 3 1/2 million firearms in Australia. The Minister may succeed in prohibiting the importation of a few. It is a fact that about 700 Australians die each year from gunshot wounds. That includes homicide, accidental death and suicide. That is an horrifically large number. However, it needs to be looked at, together with the 2,500 deaths from motor vehicle accidents this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other factors that can be taken into account in this debate-for example, the high rate of gun ownership but the low rate of homicide in Switzerland. There are reports dealing with these matters which indicate that the subculture of professional criminals will be minimally affected by such regulations and licensing that the Minister seeks to bring in. In my view, one death or assault using firearms is one too many. It would be better if the Minister did something in the community to see that that form of violence did not occur rather than bringing in these regulations and sleeping easily, believing that he has done something about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a need for sensible gun control measures, but they should not dealt with in these regulations. I realise that the Minister wants to appear to be doing something but without a regard for the real issues and the technical knowledge of what he is doing I do not believe he has succeeded. Other senators on this side of the chamber also would have liked to participate in this debate. The debate has gone on for much longer than was intended, but things had to be said in the light of the debate, the admission that the regulations are faulty and the fact that the Minister is rushing on with them without getting them right. Senator Michael Baume has been involved with many of the organisations. He too would have liked to speak. At this stage it is clear that the Democrats are determined to support the Government with the regulations. I am very disappointed that the Democrats were not prepared to use their influence with the Government to say, `Fair go. We understand what you are trying to do but do it properly and do not just get it half right'.
       </para>
       <para>
        When will the changes come in? We will be flat out between now and 21 June and hardly able to cope with the volume of legislation which is before us. Then there will be the recession until the Budget session. I really wonder what, in fact, the Government is doing and why it is that it will not do so properly.

        In speaking to this final annual report of the Australian bicentennial road development (ABRD) program I want to emphasise how much I appreciate any program which seeks to improve our roads. This is the seventh and final report on progress made in carrying out the ABRD program. Originally an initiative of the Fraser Government, it was supported enthusiastically by the then Minister, the Hon. Ralph Hunt. The program finally came into effect on 20 December 1982 for the purpose of providing a major impetus to the development of Australia's road system by the end of the nation's bicentennial year in 1988. It ended on 31 December of that year.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was to be financed by a special surcharge on diesel fuel and motor spirit. As the report notes on page 11, the rates of surcharge were established at 1c a litre for the period 17 August 1982 to 30 June 1983, and 2c a litre for the period 1 July 1983 to 31 December 1988. It also notes that although these collections were supposedly for sole use on the roads, they were paid into consolidated revenue. In 1988-89 rebates, remissions and refunds under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act exceeded gross surcharge collections under the 1c levy by $671,000. Net collections under the 2c levy were $223.7m.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is about the progress over those years and the expenditure of that surcharge that I want to make a few points this evening. As I said, the ABRD program was to be financed by a special surcharge on petrol. What has happened is that while more than half the money spent by motorists on petrol goes to the Federal Government, for every litre of petrol or diesel purchased the Government takes about 26c in tax, returning only about 5c to 5.5c to the motorist in the form of road funding-the reason that it was imposed in the first place. Consequently, it has placed greater financial strain on local and State authorities already struggling to cope with rising costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the fact that a major part of the program was to upgrade the national highways. However, in the process the arterial and rural roads were forgotten. The situation has now developed where local authorities have not been given enough for their own areas even to maintain those arterial roads. What has resulted is a major discrepancy between the two wonderful national highways. However, when we drive off the highways all we get are pot-holed surfaces and, many times, roads that have been returned to dirt and gravel instead of bitumen because councils cannot afford the upkeep.
       </para>
       <para>
        Local authorities are, naturally, very concerned about the Government's refusal to acknowledge that insufficient funding has become a gigantic problem. Cuts have been particularly bad and have had a major impact in country areas. It has become impossible to keep up with the demand for new and improved roads to cater for the needs of the transport industry and the individual motorist. As fewer roadworks are commenced, fewer jobs become available in road construction and maintenance. This has had a particularly detrimental effect on employment opportunities in many provincial and rural centres. I have noticed this particularly in our South Burnett area where one reads in the local papers from time to time about many council employees who have lost their jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        A safe, reliable road network is of fundamental importance to our nation's economy. Poor roads serve only to isolate communities, increase fuel consumption, damage vehicles and increase the costs of goods and services. As most honourable senators will be aware, the ABRD and the Australian land transport programs were replaced by the current Australian centennial roads development program.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are very important matters that I wanted to bring before the Senate this evening. One sees the number of articles about the state of the roads in rural Queensland, including statements like, `Lack of road funding is an insult to every travelling motorist. It is an insult to our intelligence to get so little back from our fuel tax for our roads. It is unfair that people in the most productive areas of Australia have to put up with deteriorating roads while money for roads is lavished on Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra', as we see around us.

        They are fine objectives and I am not decrying this particular program but, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, when the levy was first imposed for the funding of this national road system, I do not think anybody believed that the Government was going to use it as just another means of filling up the coffers of the consolidated revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to a statement made by the Minister for Land Transport, Mr Bob Brown, about the fact that spending on country roads is disproportionate to spending on urban roads. It certainly is. He ignores the fact that rural roads are the vital link in this country's export capacity.

        I took note of the consumer price index fuel indexation that people have been talking about for quite some time. Back in 1970 when it first started we were looking at 3.365c per litre of fuel. Then, when the Hawke Government came to power in 1982, it was 6.1c to 7.1c. By 1987 it had jumped to 15.766c, in 1990 it was 24.12 and as, Senator Bjelke-Petersen pointed out, it is now quite considerably more than that.

       <para>
        While the Government has been collecting all this extra revenue-billions and billions of dollars, not only from this particular area but also from the tax on crude oil; and we must remember that in the Budget last year the Government budgeted on the price of oil being about $23 a barrel when, in fact, it went a lot higher so the Government had a windfall gain there-the amount of money that is being spent on roads has been reduced by about 27 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has just not played the game fairly. What has happened is that the Government has been squeezing motorists for more and more money and giving less and less for road funding. I think this point was raised in the last election campaign by quite a lot of community groups but, in particular, by the automobile associations. We can all remember the campaign that they ran and the sorts of priorities that were shown by the people of Australia.

        Another thing has not worked out as well as expected, as honourable senators may remember. During the election campaign, the Labor Government promised $100m a year extra for a provincial cities and rural highways program. This was to be funded by the tax on luxury cars. We all know what happened to that. That went out the back door very quickly because it put half the car dealers in Australia in a terrible financial situation. What has happened to that $100m a year that was promised at the 1990 election? I can guarantee that that money will not be spent on a rural highways program or on provincial cities.

        The motorists of Australia have been conned by this Government. They have been ripped off. The petrol bowser has become just another source of income for the Government.

         â€”I also wish to speak on the annual report on the Australian bicentennial road development program, which formally ended on 31 December 1988. The program was established in 1982 by the last coalition Government. It was funded through a surcharge on motor spirit and diesel fuel excise. Moneys from this source were paid into a trust fund.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The last coalition Budget allocated $1,058m for road transport expenditure. It also set the level of expenditure for the following year at $1,265m. However, since the Labor Government came to power and set the level of road expenditure, funding for roads has stagnated in nominal terms and fallen in real terms by about 40 per cent. However, at the same time, hypothecated fuel excise as a proportion of total fuel taxes has fallen from well over 50 per cent to under 25 per cent. Petrol excise has risen from about 6c per litre to nearly 25c per litre.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's record in the area of road funding has been nothing short of a disgrace. The Government has continually failed to provide the funds necessary for Australians to have the roads they need and deserve. A better road transport funding policy would enable Australia to reap significant benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Probably the most important issue is that of road safety. It has been estimated that bad roads contribute to about 30 per cent of all crashes. Better roads are safer roads. Widening traffic lanes by one metre can reduce head-on crashes and run off road crashes by 29 per cent. Passing lanes can cut crashes by 50 per cent. Replacing an undivided road with a freeway can cut crashes by 90 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Road transport costs alone are typically in the order of 5 per cent of the total product costs within the more trade exposed parts of the manufacturing sector. An Industries Assistance Commission and Business Council of Australia study has suggested that increasing efficiency in the road transport area could lead to a $1.7 billion increase in national output, something Australia needs at this time in its economic history. Rough surfaces increase fuel consumption by 20 per cent and vehicle repair costs by nearly 40 per cent, again adding undue costs especially to our farm and manufactured goods. It costs $1 per minute every time a heavy transport is held up in traffic, not to mention the environmental consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, in reality, what do we have? Nationwide sealed roads are being torn up and returned to gravel because local governments cannot afford to maintain them. In my electorate in Victoria, I have been taken around the shire of Werribee and shown the appalling state of the roads. The shire councillors have taken me around Sherbrooke Shire, one of the developing areas which has had a high increase in population, and I have been shown the appalling and deteriorating state of the roads there.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over half our major roads have surfaces that are 20 years old. It has been disturbing that some of the men who constructed those roads for a company that was associated with road construction have come to my office and told me that many roads are actually reaching the end of their lives. This Government has never committed itself to an adequate level of road funding, and it seems destined to continue along the same path. I find it very interesting that only colleagues on this side of the Senate have expressed any concern for or interest in this annual report.

         â€”I rise to speak briefly on the annual report on the Australian bicentennial road development (ABRD) program. I have pleasure in doing so because this report winds up a very good program, which was probably one of the last pro- jects of lasting importance commenced under Malcolm Fraser's last Budget. It is not that the other measures he put into place, including this Parliament House, were not of lasting importance, but the ABRD program certainly was because that is where the concept of road funding and better road construction in Australia started. It introduced a predictable level of funding, which had not existed before.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Patterson has already pointed out that increased road funding started with the introduction of a fuel excise of, I think, 2c per litre. That excise was to go into this trust fund which was meant to distribute money to four categories of roads, if I remember correctly: national roads, which involved national interstate highways; urban arterial roads; State arterial roads; and local roads. The money was passed out to the State governments to be distributed to their main roads departments. Of course, money went through local government as well. The road system of Australia improved no end as a result of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most significant features of the change in road funding was that for the first time main roads departments had to tender for their own jobs. In other words, they had to tender alongside private enterprise for the big projects. Some main roads departments won the contracts and some did not, but it put a lot more responsibility into road making. We saw the benefits of that. Unfortunately, those benefits are starting to run down now because of the lack of funding for roads provided by this Government since it came into power in 1983. The amount spent on roads is ever decreasing in real terms. Tendering certainly made tend- erers a lot keener, and the roads that were built were a lot better.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Patterson pointed out that there are roads in Victoria that have not had any money spent on them for the last 20 years. Normally, when a commercial main road is built, it can be expected that not too much will have to be spent on it for 15 years. Those roads are normally made with a life expectancy of 35 years but, at the 15-year level, some money has to be spent on maintenance. Senator Patterson referred to the state of some roads in Victoria five years ago, and what she said applies also to New South Wales and my State of Western Australia. The Government has failed these areas in road funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Patterson said, a lot of those roads are being ripped up and are being put back to gravel because of the lack of funding. Those good, solid bitumen roads will last 35 years as long as we maintain them. A lot of people have the idea that, once a bitumen road is down, it is down for life and nothing else is done on it. But that is not right. It is a lot cheaper to maintain a bitumen road than a gravel road early in its life but, as bitumen roads reach the age of 15, 20 and 35 years, the level of spending becomes far greater than for gravel roads. Gravel roads require continuous maintenance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that our former Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, through his last Budget of 1982, did a great service to Australia by getting the ABRD system going. It was changed to a Commonwealth road development system about two years ago and last year was changed totally through the land transport Bill. Now there are far too many ministerial powers governing where road funding is allocated. Unfortunately, what road funding is available tends to go into the areas that are more receptive to ballot boxes than into the areas where good roads are needed. In conclusion, I believe that this has been a very worthwhile program since 1982 and I hope that in some way or other it can continue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        When I moved on 20 September 1990 for the terms of reference for the inquiry which led to this report, peacekeeping was emerging as a high priority on the international agenda. United Nations peacekeeping missions in the Western Sahara and Cambodia were already under active consideration. In the short time since then a new peacekeeping mission has been established on the Iraq-Kuwait border in the aftermath of the Gulf war.
       </para>
       <para>
        Participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations is now, more than ever before, one of the high-probability tasks of the Australian Defence Force. Opportunities for civilian contributions are also likely to increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        Scope of the Report
       </para>
       <para>
        The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is confident that its report will make a positive contribution to the evaluation of Australia's role in United Nations peacekeeping. As the terms of reference suggest, there are several important issues that need to be addressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report gives a brief outline of the evolution of peacekeeping and the way it is managed and administered by the United Nations and in Australia. The report does not examine Australia's role in the Gulf war, as the Committee took the view that this was outside the scope of the terms of reference for the inquiry laid down by the Senate. The report looks at Australia's past participation in United Nations peacekeeping and the demands that may be placed upon Australia in the future. It examines critically the costs and benefits to Australia of that participation. The report explores the role and possible contribution that non-military organisations can make to peacekeeping. It addresses the critical issue of public support of peacekeeping in Australia. The report examines the perspectives that have dominated Australia's past approach to providing resources for United Nations peacekeeping, and looks to a clearer and increased commitment to peacekeeping in the future. The Committee endorses the importance given to United Nations peacekeeping activities by successive Australian governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Objectives
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence before the Committee suggested that the underlying objectives for Australian involvement in United Nations peacekeeping need to be more effectively drawn together and publicly enunciated. The report emphasises the importance of assessing peacekeeping activities as part of wider Australian security concerns and foreign policy interests. The Committee was struck by a certain amount of confusion in the material before it between the objectives that Australia should seek to achieve through participation in peacekeeping, and benefits that might flow from such participation. For the purposes of assessing whether or not Australia should participate in a particular peacekeeping exercise, it is important to maintain a clear distinction between the two.
       </para>
       <para>
        Historically, Australia has rightly attached importance to the contribution of multilateral institutions such as the United Nations to a favourable international order. It has given concrete expression to this commitment by contributing to a substantial number of the United Nations peacekeeping operations that have been conducted. However, a much stronger linkage to Australia's overall foreign policy objectives must be established if decisions to become involved in specific peacekeeping operations are to be soundly based. The relative importance to be attached and resources devoted to fulfilling obligations under the United Nations charter, as opposed to using other foreign policy instruments, need to be carefully considered.
       </para>
       <para>
        A theme common to a number of the submissions before the Committee was the increased scope, with the ending of the Cold War, for the United Nations to play a more constructive and influential role on the world stage. It is essential that policy advisers critically examine this proposition. An assessment of the validity of this proposition should be a vital component in any decisions on the relative effort Australia should put into activities like peacekeeping.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regional Cooperation
       </para>
       <para>
        The balance of effort that should go into potential regional peacekeeping commitments such as Cambodia, as opposed to more distant ones such as the Western Sahara, is another key issue that must be addressed more fully than it has been in the past. A pro-active approach to encouraging greater cooperation with regional countries in relation to United Nations peacekeeping is an area where Australia has the capacity to creatively influence the regional defence and security agenda.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's report recommends that the Australian Government take the initiative to explore with countries of the region the idea of greater regional cooperation, at various levels, in developing a capacity to respond to United Nations peacekeeping requests speedily and efficiently. The emphasis should be on giving a new focus to the links which already exist under ongoing defence and foreign policy programs. The Committee sees this as a potentially valuable component in the network of linkages that Australia is seeking to establish with the countries of the region. Adequate resources to achieve this objective will have to be provided. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in his address to the Asia-Australia Institute last Friday that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . we no longer seek, through our alliances, to build up walls of defence against the region, but to build bridges of cooperation with the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee sees its proposal that the Government initiate discussion with countries of the region aimed at developing a regional capacity to contribute to peacekeeping as an important positive element in the building of these bridges of cooperation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Defence Force Objectives
       </para>
       <para>
        Evidence presented to the Committee indicated that peacekeeping was seen by the Department of Defence as a positive and worthwhile but somewhat peripheral activity. The Committee believes that the ambiguity implicit in this approach can be effectively reconciled only by including an upgraded commitment to peacekeeping in the explicit objectives of the Australian Defence Force. The Committee's report therefore recommends that the Australian contributions to international peacekeeping be explicitly included in the objectives of the Australian Defence Force, and in particular be recognised as one positive element in regional security cooperation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The contribution of Australian peacekeeping contingents to a particular operation should first be assessed on a case by case basis; secondly, utilise existing capabilities; and, thirdly, play no role in determining the structure of the Australian Defence Force. I seek leave to have the remainder of my remarks incorporated in Hansard.

       <para>
        Policy-making and Administration
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee heard criticism during its hearings of the United Nations policy-making and administrative machinery for peacekeeping operations. Witnesses proposed suggestions for improvements and for achieving greater Australian influence at UN Headquarters, and in the operational command of missions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has stressed that the Australian Government should give a high priority in its foreign policy objectives to seeking improvement of the UN machinery for peacekeeping.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, the permanent appointment of an Australian officer to the UN Secretary General's Military Planning Staff should be actively and vigorously pursued.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the prospect of peacekeeping requirements emerging closer to Australia's own region and immediate interests, it may become critically important for Australia to be successful in obtaining command appointments. The evidence given to the Committee suggested that it is now recognised that in operations such as the one in prospect in Cambodia, the appointment of an Australian to command the operation in the event of an Australian contribution would be most desirable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has recommended that if Australia was to commit forces to a peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, steps should be taken at the most senior levels, and every avenue pursued, to put to the United Nations Secretariat Australia's case for command of the operation. Success in this endeavour will require persistence and a high level of diplomatic skill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Peacekeeping Secretariat
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee examined the adequacy of current organisational arrangements within the bureaucracy in Australia for handling peacekeeping issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        It became obvious that information on the basic question of financial costs to Australia was fragmented within the bureaucracy, difficult to access and inadequate. The Committee has recommended that a more comprehensive picture of the total financial cost of any Australian contributions be readily available to Government, to the Parliament and to the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        More generally, there appears to be inadequate capability for critical evaluation of peacekeeping operations. The Committee was struck by the apparently haphazard nature of the evaluation of past peacekeeping operations and Australia's role in them. Individual Australian contingent commanders have reported to the Government on their assignments. What is less clear is the extent to which these reports have informed subsequent decision-makers and participants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The disparate nature of the various peacekeeping operations, their geographic spread, and the different locations within the Defence Department that have had management responsibility for particular operations, all suggest that the lessons of the past may not have been fully absorbed and as well integrated into future policy advice as they might.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem is compounded by the absence of an in-built evaluation system within the UN. Although efforts have apparently been made by Australian officials to remedy this, they have so far met with very limited success.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee came to the view that there was a need for a fresh look at existing organisational arrangements in Australia for coordinating policy advice on peacekeeping.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has recommended that a permanent Australian Government secretariat or task force be established as a matter of priority to oversight and coordinate the many and varied aspects of peacekeeping in the evolving international order. Representatives from the various relevant departments and agencies should be seconded to the unit as required.
       </para>
       <para>
        The basic role of the unit should be pro-active, not reactive. Its starting point should be a clear identification of Australia's interests in peacekeeping, both generally, and as specific cases arise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has drawn up a suggested reference list of factors that should be taken into account by the proposed peacekeeping secretariat in formulating policy advice on participation by Australia in future operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the event of a mixed Australian military/civilian contribution to future peacekeeping operations, particularly in situations such as Cambodia, careful attention will need to be given to establishing appropriate mechanisms to maximise effective coordination.
       </para>
       <para>
        These mechanisms should extend to civilian non-governmental organisations, whose activities are complementary to but not part of the peacekeeping operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The responsibility for ensuring that adequate mechanisms for effective coordination are in place for any particular peacekeeping operation should lie with the small permanent peacekeeping secretariat the Committee has proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Public Support
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee took the view that the support of the Australian public for participation in peacekeeping missions was of vital importance.
       </para>
       <para>
        We observed, however, that by and large, the community was sometimes poorly informed and appeared unaware of the specific extent and range of Australia's involvement with peacekeeping activities. Knowledge of some of the smaller contingents, such as the observers on the Iran-Iraq border, seemed particularly poor.
       </para>
       <para>
        Public support for Australian participation in peacekeeping operations cannot be taken for granted. Three essential issues need to be addressed if public support is to be maintained.
       </para>
       <para>
        Level of Risk
       </para>
       <para>
        First, it is essential to make as accurate an assessment of likely risk as possible. This has not always proved easy or straightforward in the past. With the benefits of hindsight, it appears the level of risk in the case of the observers sent to the Iran-Iraq border was seriously underestimated, while the conditions in Namibia proved to be less hazardous than had been feared initially. Information available from the United Nations apparently proved inadequate.

        One of the lessons to be drawn is the value of sending an advance scout to assess the situation on the ground. It is particularly important to do so when there is good reason to expect a high level of risk, as would undoubtedly be the case in Cambodia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has therefore recommended that on-the-ground assessment of the security situation by Australian personnel in the country of a proposed United Nations peacekeeping operation be instituted as standard procedure before the commitment of forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, steps must be taken to minimise the risks as far as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        An essential requirement for this is that the political settlement on which the peacekeeping operation is to be based should be a durable one. In other words, all parties to the conflict would have to be committed to a comprehensive settlement and to the relevant Security Council resolutions and to the agreed operational plans. The Committee has recommended that this kind of commitment be a precondition for the commitment of any Australian contribution to a UN peacekeeping force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, every effort needs to be made to adequately inform and prepare the Australian public. A basic requirement is public understanding of the reasons for a particular peacekeeping operation, why it matters and why Australia should play a part in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Public Information
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has recommended that a statement of the factors being taken into account by the Government in deciding on participation in a proposed specific peacekeeping operation be publicised widely in the Australian community before a final decision on participation in that operation is reached.
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise that broad public acceptance that the effort is worthwhile is essential.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recognition
       </para>
       <para>
        Another way of achieving a higher profile for Australia's involvement in peacekeeping would be to ensure that peacekeepers returning from their mission are given due public recognition for the services they have performed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was pleased to see the public welcome given to the Army engineers returning from Namibia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is obviously more difficult to achieve the same impact when a small group of observers are involved on a rotation basis over an extended period of time, as they were in UNIIMOG on the Iran-Iraq border. Nevertheless the Defence Forces Public Relations unit should endeavour to attract favourable publicity for each rotation and for some individual cases.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has recommended that Australia's role in peacekeeping, both military and civilian, be given greater acknowledgment by Government, and be more actively publicised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Medal
       </para>
       <para>
        The award of the Australian Service Medal is an occasion that could be used in this way. Not only is this useful for ensuring that peacekeeping stays in the public eye, but gives a valuable boost to the morale of those participating.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, awards such as the Australian Service Medal should be arranged as soon as possible after the return of an Australian peacekeeping contingent at appropriate public and well-publicised occasions. Consideration should also be given to striking a special medal in certain instances.
       </para>
       <para>
        Official History
       </para>
       <para>
        In the course of the inquiry, the Committee became conscious of the dearth of publicly available material about Australia's past involvement in some peacekeeping operations. Australia's past contributions deserve more public attention than they have received.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has therefore recommended that the Official Historian at the Australian War Memorial be commissioned to write a full history of Australian participation in peacekeeping and that it be distributed widely, as one means of maintaining public awareness of the importance of the principles of peacekeeping.
       </para>
       <para>
        Service Conditions
       </para>
       <para>
        Evidence was taken during the inquiry on conditions of service for those serving with Australian contingents to peacekeeping missions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overwhelmingly, the Committee gathered the impression that those from the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police and other civilians who had served in peacekeeping operations were dedicated professionals with a very high level of commitment, proud to represent Australia overseas and concerned to acquit themselves to the very best of their ability.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the goodwill and commitment of those embarking on peacekeeping missions, which invariably have the potential to be stressful, hazardous and difficult, does not absolve the authorities responsible from providing consistent, fair and equitable recompense to those who serve in them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accurate information about the terms and conditions should be available to participants before they embark on their missions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has recommended that a comprehensive review of conditions of service be undertaken to establish mechanisms for both military and civilian personnel to ensure that fair and consistent conditions of service apply to all Australian participants in peacekeeping, and that the determination of these conditions of service is both quick and transparent, and made subject to regular evaluation. The Committee has also recommended measures to assist in the welfare of the families in Australia of Service personnel involved in future peacekeeping operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Training
       </para>
       <para>
        There was almost universal acknowledgment by individuals who gave evidence of their personal experience of peacekeeping that there was one area which they initially found particularly challenging. In nearly all cases of personal testimony, the police or military officers felt that the demands on their mediation skills went well beyond the normal requirements of service in the police or defence force in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Negotiation and conflict resolution was a crucial function for peacekeeping. All who had participated in peacekeeping missions, especially in the cases of Cyprus and the Iran-Iraq border, felt they had experienced considerable personal growth and substantially developed their negotiating skills during the course of their assignment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has recommended that additional emphasis be given to negotiation and conflict resolution skills in the pre-posting training for those embarking on peacekeeping missions.
       </para>

        Policewomen
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian police officers have been deployed as part of the United Nations Civilian Police in Cyprus since 1964.
       </para>
       <para>
        A notable feature of the Australian police contingent in Cyprus in recent years has been the presence of women officers, who have performed the full range of duties assigned to the unit. This is believed to be the first time that women have served in a front line capacity with a UN peacekeeping operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has commended the pioneering role of the Australian Federal Police in including women in its peacekeeping contingent in Cyprus, and recommended that action be taken to ensure that women have equal opportunity to participate in future Australian contributions to peacekeeping operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        NGO Participation
       </para>
       <para>
        Aside from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has on occasions worked closely with UN peacekeeping operations in the exercise of its own mandate, there has never been any formal non-governmental organisation participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau told the Committee that non-governmental organisation participation in future operations is by no means excluded, although it is clear that little thought has been given in the UN Secretariat to the formalisation of such participation. It is the Committee's view that, while peacekeeping and activities such as rehabilitation assistance should be conducted in a mutually supportive way, they need not necessarily be formally linked. A parallel but coordinated approach seems the best in the foreseeable future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Costs and Benefits
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee concluded that the benefits to Australia of participation in peacekeeping have so far outweighed the costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        It cannot, however, be taken for granted that this will always be the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Careful judgements will have to be made about each opportunity as it arises. It is my belief that the nineteen recommendations in the Committee's report will help to ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the costs.

        I also wish to thank the staff of the Committee for their assistance.

         â€”As Deputy Chairman of the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into Australia and United Nations peacekeeping, I support the remarks of the Chairman, Senator Maguire, and note the bipartisan way in which the eight members of the Committee conducted this inquiry so profitably. The substance of our conclusions and recommendations are set out in the report tabled here today. It is a very timely report. In fact, this has been the first parliamentary inquiry into Australia's involvement in United Nations (UN) peacekeeping. On a worldwide scale, I believe that there will be more and more calls for the nations of the world to contribute to the United Nations peacekeeping contingents. In recent times we have seen a very successful peacekeeping contingent in Namibia, which was the midwife to the independence of that country and, indeed, the establishment of a democratic foundation for an independent Namibia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Other recent important roles have been played by UN peacekeeping forces in the conclusion of the Iran-Iraq conflict, which was a positive contribution, despite Iraq's aggression then against Kuwait, and a quite different and terrible conflict leading to the events of which we know only too well that occurred in the Gulf in recent months.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have also had long-standing peacekeeping arrangements, sponsored by the United Nations, in the Middle East-particularly related to Israel, Lebanon and Cyprus where the Turkish-speaking and Greek-speaking communities are still separated by a buffer zone that is policed by a United Nations peacekeeping force. The Australian contingent to that Cyprus peacekeeping force has made a very proud contribution over a period of about 30 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to commend the way in which the inquiry into Australia's involvement in peacekeeping was conducted by the Senate Committee with the very substantial assistance of the Committee Secretary, Mrs Ilze Svenne. I wish to refer to four of the Committee's conclusions in the very brief time that we have to speak at this stage, now that the Senate has received this report. Firstly, in Australia we have never set out in any examination of the objectives of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) an explicit reference to international peacekeeping, or to United Nations peacekeeping in particular. Although Australia has, with a proud record, contributed to some 16 United Nations peacekeeping exercises over the last 40 years, nevertheless, there is no explicit reference in the objectives of the Australian Defence Force to such contributions being made or to the fact that we have a defence force from which, from time to time, contingents will be drawn to contribute to international peace- keeping.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even in the 1987 Defence White Paper, UN peacekeeping is not explicitly included amongst the objectives of the ADF. I believe this is a serious omission and one that needs to be brought up to date to take into account our long record over four decades and, indeed, the contributions we are likely to make in the years ahead.
       </para>
       <para>
        This matter has the bipartisan support of the Government and the Opposition in this Parliament and the Australian public is rightly proud to see our very professional defence forces making contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. I believe there needs to be an explicit inclusion of this in the objectives of the Australian Defence Force in the way in which we have set them out in the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        As an example of how there is a direct transition from our foreign policy to our defence policy, in this country we believe very strongly that there should be independent democratic nations in southern Africa and that the achievement of such outcomes will contribute to the peace of that region and the peace of the world. To achieve this Australian foreign policy objective, we found that it would be a very positive move to contribute a defence group of Australian Army engineers to the transitional peacekeeping group in Namibia. I believe without that contribution we would not now be seeing a sound democratic Namibia and the arrival of a new, independent country. I instance this example of Namibia to show that an explicit foreign policy objective of Australia has been achieved by the deployment of a defence contingent to this peacekeeping group in southern Africa.
       </para>
       <para>
        This link between our foreign policy and our defence policy ought to be explicit when we contemplate the objectives of the Australian Defence Force. There should be no apology for Australia's contribution to UN peacekeeping. Whilst of course the principle objective of the Australian Defence Force is the direct defence of Australia, it has been proved that there is another objective: to contribute to good international citizenship and the alleviation of tensions, the prevention of war and the achievement of peace in our own region and in other regions where we can make a contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area I wish to refer to briefly concerns Cambodia. In this chamber we have often referred to the need for a comprehensive settlement to which all four factions in Cambodia will subscribe. We envisage in our discussions that there should then be a transitional peacekeeping force in Cambodia. Not only has Australia sponsored the shape that that force should take, but also I believe we ought to be ready to contribute very substantially to that force in Cambodia and even to supply the commander of the force. An important conference will be held in Jakarta on 2, 3 and 4 June and we hope that that comprehensive settlement will be achieved by the resolution of the two outstanding matters with regard to Cambodia. The world will then be able to serve Indo-China, and the Khmer people in particular, by providing a peacekeeping force which will have the task of implementing the settlement.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will cost at least $1 billion in the first 12 months and it may be in place for two years. It will be a very substantial undertaking. I note that at the moment the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations are costing the world an amount that is exceeding the actual administrative costs of the United Nations. At the moment the UN peacekeeping budget is a little more than twice the administrative budget of the UN in order to pay for the various peacekeeping forces that the United Nations Security Council has put in place and to which we, and other nations, have contributed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third area to which I wish to refer concerns the need for a secretariat in foreign affairs in order to pull together our foreign affairs inputs to peacekeeping and our defence inputs to peacekeeping. At the moment there is not sufficient integration of policy and planning. We are not even able to detail the exact costs to Australia-including our compensation from the United Nations budget-of the activities to which we have contributed already. Not least, there is a need for the secretariat to implement the recommendations of the report that we are now bringing forward and also to build regional training cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, which I believe is an important way to complement the defence cooperation schemes that we already have in place with the Pacific nations and the Association of South East Asian Nations. I believe the countries of the South Pacific and South East Asia can move to a closer defence association with Australia by integrated training programs for United Nations peacekeeping.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I note that our report is already a little out of date. Even though we drafted the report only a few weeks ago, there is perhaps a too explicit reliance on formulas of peacekeeping that require both parties to a conflict to agree to the peace- keeping force being deployed by the Security Council of the United Nations. I note that some peacekeeping operations will have the assent of only one party.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cite the current example of Unicom's involvement in Kuwait which has the assent of Kuwait only and not the explicit consent of Iraq, given the abhorrent isolationist non-cooperation of Saddam Hussein. In this case there is a useful peacekeeping contingent with contributions from 30 nations. It will be a positive guarantee for Kuwait's independence, but it does not have the assent of one of the parties to the conflict-Iraq. It does not meet the immediate formulas of peacekeeping, as we have set out in the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I refer to my participation this past week in a UN peacekeeping discussion in Canada. Beyond the reference of Australia and UN peacekeeping, in our discussion in Ottawa we addressed ways of strengthening UN peacekeeping. I seek leave to incorporate a two-page document outlining the conclusions of the conference in Ottawa. The document was prepared by the Parliamentarians for Global Action and is entitled `The Ottawa Declaration on UN Collective Security'. It was adopted in Ottawa on 22 May and I was one of the signatories, along with those from about 20 other parliaments around the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        Leave granted.

       <para>
        We, members of Parliamentarians for Global Action's Commission on Collective Security, call upon all governments and parliamentarians to act together to strengthen the collective security system of the United Nations.
       </para>
       <para>
        For forty years, the world was caught in the grip of the Cold War. International peace and security was dominated by theories of nuclear deterrence and adversarial defence alliances.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today, the Cold War is replaced by a new era of co-operation and the search for a new world order. The recent conflict in the Gulf demonstrates the capacity of the international community to take quick and decisive action in response to aggression. But the mechanism for acting through the United Nations remains underdeveloped.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new order must be based on disarmament and reduced military expenditure. It must rest on a respect for human rights, social justice among nations and a commitment to sustainable development, particularly the development of the South; it must answer the needs of the South as well as the needs of the North. It must rest on the notion of common security and be underpinned by an effective collective security system through the UN Security Council with the strong support of Member States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The nuclear nightmare of recent decades must be replaced by a rational framework for peace. The mechanism for peace must be put in place during the 1990s. We reject the argument that such a system cannot be afforded: the rule of law will prove less costly than the chaos of war.

       <para>
        We call upon governments:
       </para>
       <para>
        - to initiate, in addition to existing UN peacekeeping arrangements, a system of ``preventive'' peacekeeping by which UN troops could be deployed along the border of a nation legitimately fearing attack, to be backed as necessary by forces authorised by the Security Council, as a deterrent to possible aggression by another State and a signal of the resolve of the international community to remain seized of the situation.

       <para>
        2. PARLIAMENTARY INITIATIVES
       </para>

       </para>

       <para>
        3. CHARTER REVIEW CONFERENCE
       </para>
       <para>
        The mechanism for strengthening collective security already exists in the UN Charter. What is needed now is a political process at a high level in which the international community can focus on strengthening the collective security mechanism of the United Nations. We therefore call upon governments:
       </para>
       <para>
        - to decide at the 46th General Assembly to convene a UN Special Session on International Peace and Security, in preparation for Charter Review Conference at the summit level in 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the UN Charter, to ensure that collective security can be made to work.
       </para>

        4. STRENGTHENING UN PEACEKEEPING
       </para>
       <para>
        While the above measures are matters of urgent priority that deserve high-level political attention, we call on governments to pursue vigorously the following initiatives:
       </para>
       <para>
        a. to respond positively to the UN Secretary-General's appeal to Member States to identify troops and materiel that can in principle be made available to the UN for peacekeeping operations, and to explore, as a next step, scope for increasing possible contributions through regional cooperation and burden-sharing;
       </para>
       <para>
        b. to set up UN peacekeeping training centres in each region of the world along the lines of the Nordic UN Peacekeeping Training Centres;
       </para>
       <para>
        c. to expand the UN Peacekeeping Supply Depot at Pisa, Italy, and establish supply depots in each region;
       </para>
       <para>
        d. to pay off all financial arrears owed by the opening of the 47th General Assembly;
       </para>
       <para>
        e. to help ensure that UN peacekeeping operations are financed promptly and fully, by increasing the UN Working Capital Fund by at least $100 million dollars, and by contributions to the Trust Fund for peacekeeping operations;
       </para>
       <para>
        f. to upgrade the early-warning capacity of the United Nations to anticipate conflict by arranging for the UN Secretary-General to assign representatives to the major regional organisations (such as the OAU, OAS, Arab League, CSCE, South Pacific Forum and ASEAN) to keep the Secretary-General apprised of emerging crises;
       </para>
       <para>
        g. to strengthen the military liaison between governments and the United Nations for the purposes of peacekeeping;
       </para>
       <para>
        h. to have the General Assembly delegate authority to the Secretary-General to seek advisory opinions from the International Court of Justice on the legal aspects of border disputes that could threaten international peace and security.

         â€”The subject of this report is highly topical, coming as it does after the creation of another United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force on the Iraq-Kuwait border and just before the controversial statement on defence, which the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is to make tomorrow. I agree with many of the points made by the two previous speakers in discussing this idea of United Nations peacekeeping. It is important that we have bipartisan support in the Parliament. That is highly commendable. It is also necessary that we get a specific aim of support for United Nations peacekeeping forces incorporated into the aims of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) because that aim should certainly be there and be clearly specified. I also agree with Senator Teague that we need a secretariat in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to coordinate the efforts of the Australian contribution to United Nations peacekeeping teams. Without a significant increase in the budget of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, this will not happen.

        If we got a one per cent cut in the budget of the Department of Defence, which transferred directly to the Foreign Affairs budget, it would result in a 5 per cent increase in the Foreign Affairs budget, which shows clearly the imbalance between those two departments. But that is what has to happen. We need a massive injection of funding into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade before this kind of coordination can take place. I have always argued that, as part of a strategy of transarmament, for the time being Australia needs a much smaller military force which does not operate beyond our shores, apart from disaster relief operations-for example, in the Pacific and the Asian region, and in service with the United Nations, which is the subject of this report. Forces sent to serve with the United Nations should be non-combatant forces. I am pleased that Australia has a reasonably good record of participating in UN peacekeeping operations over the years. The members of the ADF who have participated in peacekeeping forces deserve our congratulations for having made a fine and positive contribution towards global security.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that our role would be much more constructive if such forces, trained in a peacekeeping role, were part of a much greater commitment to the United Nations as a force for peacemaking as well as peacekeeping and not what we saw so disastrously played out in the last six months or so when the United Nations was bullied, badgered and misused as a war-making organisation rather than-as it was designed-a peacemaking organisation. I further believe that, if the military budget were substantially cut back, we could pass on some of the savings to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As I said, a one per cent cut in the budget of the Department of Defence is a 5 per cent increase for Foreign Affairs. Apart from establishing a secretariat to coordinate peacekeeping efforts, that saving should be spent on the training of our diplomats in language and negotiating skills. The other very positive contribution of the Department of Foreign Affairs in peacemaking in our region would be in terms of development aid.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, we live in a world where there are some 27 conflicts going on, many in the Asia-Pacific region. If there is to be a non-military resolution of some of these conflicts, there will be a role for peacekeeping forces in that process. Cambodia is an obvious example for such services, as Namibia was, and Colonel Crocker's testimony to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade last December was valuable because it came from someone who served with the United Nations Transitions Assistance Group in Namibia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I realise that there has been some controversy over proposals to extend our peacekeeping role, with some opposition coming from those who seem to believe that the ADF should maintain a sizeable force to defend our territory against potential hostile invaders, although I have never heard any suggestion of who these invaders might be apart from a mythical Kamaria, the country that was created for the purposes of the huge extravaganza, Kangaroo 89-the war games practised by the Australian defence forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        In reality, Australia would be well served by a force that was simply at the service of the United Nations, much along the lines of the military of the Republic of Ireland. Senator Evans has said that Australia would be willing to support the establishment of an international training centre for peacekeeping troops. I think it would be better for us to contribute towards that with money saved from the Defence review cuts, as will be announced tomorrow, rather than merely keeping that money within the defence portfolio and spending it on unnecessary new hardware, such as a helicopter carrier, AWACS or two more submarines. It is a theft from the personnel side to the hardware side of the Defence budget, but without the real improvements that we need, which is a transfer of that money out of the Defence budget into Foreign Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        United Nations peacekeeping operations are constantly hindered by a lack of money. The Namibia operation nearly fell apart through lack of advance funding. I am constantly amazed at how easily we find money for expensive new submarines or sending our Navy along with the forces of other countries to the Gulf to support the United States in a war-making exercise, yet we baulk at a contribution for real peacekeeping, let alone peacemaking. It shows how skewed our attitudes are and how we are much more prepared to go to war than to make peace. In this respect we are not the only country to have a warped sense of priorities. But a stronger commitment to the United Nations, and in particular its peacekeeping operations, would be a useful step towards redressing that imbalance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I congratulate the Committee on its work and commend the report as useful reading in conjunction with tomorrow's statement on the future of the ADF and, hopefully, in the not so distant future, a new Defence White Paper to replace the somewhat obsolete one issued four years ago. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        Introduction
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is the first in a package that I am introducing today affecting the telecommunications industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before addressing the detail of the legislation it is useful to put these reforms in context.
       </para>
       <para>
        The package gives effect to the reform package which the Prime Minister announced to the House of Representatives on 8 November last year. These telecommunications reforms are a central plank of the Hawke Government's Fourth Term commitment to micro-economic reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        In introducing network competition into this industry, we will not just be improving the efficiency of a major domestic industry. We are also aiming to lift dramatically the performance of a key infrastructure industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        All three of the current carriers (Telecom, OTC and AUSSAT) have a good technical record but have not been as responsive to customers, as innovative, or as export-oriented as they might have been. The carriers themselves recognise that they can do much better in terms of quality of service, productivity and price of services.
       </para>
       <para>
        As long as the present carriers had a monopoly on the public switched trunk network, there was only modest pressure on them to minimise costs and to develop new products and markets. Telecom's and OTC's profitability has been largely based on historical accounting conventions and regulated monopoly pricing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Competition across the network will force the merged entity to become more responsive to customers' needs, to reduce costs and to find better ways of providing existing services.
       </para>
       <para>
        These reforms, though, go beyond the scope of structural reform, important though that is. The reason for the Government's focus on this industry is that we realise the critical long-term importance for Australia of getting the regulatory framework for this industry right.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, telecommunications now provides a vital part of the infrastructure for all business operations, be they domestic or international. Having access to internationally competitive telecommunications services is therefore essential if our firms are to be able to meet their opposition in the market place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, with the globalisation of the world economy, and the explosion in information technology, it has become increasingly obvious that telecommunications will be one of the key global industries of the next century in its own right.
       </para>
       <para>
        New telecommunications services are revolutionising the way people do business. Mobile communications are growing at a phenomenal rate as are the range of value-added telecommunications services. The introduction of intelligent network services is ushering in a whole new range of sophisticated services for consumers. The future for telecommunications companies lies in integrating information technologies and telecommunications networks to connect people and information around the world. Remaining a simple provider of a telephone network is no longer an option for telecommunications companies that wish to survive, let alone prosper.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, Governments worldwide are giving reform of the telecommunications sector a high priority. In turn, the liberalisation of telecommunications markets in Western countries is both advancing and responding to the trend towards globalisation of the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The opportunities in this industry are enormous. The Asia-Pacific region is now experiencing a staggering increase in demand for telecommunications. Some estimates of this growth range as high as $130 billion in the next five years. Half of the world market in fibre optic cables, worth about $13 billion during the 1990s, will be laid in North and South Asia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has an excellent opportunity to exploit the anticipated growth in the region. We have the skills to design, plan, source, construct, operate and maintain telephone networks. Both Telecom and OTC have been successful in winning lucrative export contracts. It is important that we now build on this early success.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next century's telecommunications industry will not only be global and dynamic, it will also be very competitive. Many of the world's major economies, including those of Japan and the United States have already broken up their telecommunications monopolies and introduced competition. The Government has carefully observed the experience in those countries and is convinced that its reform package does the job better.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, the package has received international acclaim as setting a new standard for approaches to telecommunications regulatory reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government strategy for the industry aims at producing important early efficiency gains for Australia. Beyond that our policy aims to position Australian telecommunications industry to be globally competitive to meet the challenges of the next century. The short and medium term gains for consumers and for the economy as a whole will build into a global impact over a decade or so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's strategy for achieving this has two basic, closely related features
       </para>
       <para>
        - to introduce genuine and sustainable network competition for the benefit of the wider Australian economy; and
       </para>
       <para>
        - to create a world class telecommunications company that has the ability and ethos to compete vigorously in what will be a key industry in a very competitive global environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        A third important element of the Government's strategy that has yet to be finalised is the industry development arrangements that are to apply to the carriers. I am not in a position to give the precise details of these arrangements yet, as their final resolution is linked to the sale of AUSSAT.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the key selection criteria for the AUSSAT sale is that the bidders submit network development proposals that demonstrate how their business plan will also contribute to the development of wider Australian industry. There are two reasons for the importance which the Government places on these industry development proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, one of the main reasons for fundamentally restructuring the industry now is because we intend Australia to become a significant international telecommunications centre. To exploit fully the potential embodied in the other elements of the Government's reforms, it is essential that the carriers can turn to a dynamic Australian industry, with a research and development ethos that looks beyond Australia's boundaries, for necessary support.
       </para>
       <para>
        An Australian industry that is innovative, forward-looking and has a commitment to excellence will also be necessary if we are to take full advantage of the opportunities that telecommunications will present in the next century.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, we recognise that Telecom's policies have made a major contribution to the development of a significant electronics industry in Australia and a research and development base. It is important that we build on this.
       </para>
       <para>
        For these reasons, the Government will be examining bidders' proposed industry plans closely, with a view to formulating an appropriate industry development plan for inclusion in carriers' licence conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In developing its framework for reform, the Government has remained mindful of the continuing social importance of telecommunications to Australian society. The Prime Minister has already guaranteed that no ordinary consumer of the phone system will be disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of competition. This assurance can be given for two main reasons.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, the Government will preserve the merged Telecom/OTC in full public ownership. This enables the Government, in its capacity as shareholder as well as regulator, to ensure that the dominant network provider will continue to meet the Government's social objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, the price cap arrangements for Telecom/OTC in the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1991 (the AOTC Bill), in combination with the new entity's universal service obligation in the Telecommunications Bill, will ensure that the price benefits from competition will be distributed among consumers in an equitable way.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, as I mentioned earlier, competition is likely to produce significant gains for all consumers. The overwhelming evidence from Western nations that have introduced network competition is that the real price of telecommunications services to business and household consumers has fallen, and the quality of service has improved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The package of bills that the Government is introducing today is designed to maximise the benefits for Australia from its telecommunications industry. It will create a robust, globally competitive industry which is capable of seeing Australia into the next century. At the same time it will deliver improved services at lower prices to both the wider economy and ordinary householders.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Telecommunications Bill 1991 replaces the Telecommunications Act 1989 (which is repealed by the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1991). As such, the new Telecommunications Bill will provide the general regulatory framework for the provision of telecommunications facilities and services in Australia. The Bill is intended to cover the field in relation to the activities of licensed carriers. Certain specific regulatory matters relating to pricing arrangements that will apply only to the merged Telecom/OTC are dealt with under the AOTC Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the process of developing the Bill, an extensive process of public consultation has been undertaken. This has involved the circulation of an Exposure Draft of the legislation for public comment and consultation with key affected community groups. The Bill gives effect to the Government's November 1990 decisions in the context of a process which has taken into account legitimate concerns of the main groups with an interest in these matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        General Principles
       </para>
       <para>
        In policy terms, this Bill essentially does eight things:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. it provides a framework for fostering genuine and sustainable network competition;
       </para>
       <para>
        2. it provides a framework for fostering competition among all service providers (whether carriers or not), consistent with fostering sustainable network competition;
       </para>
       <para>
        3. it ensures that certain specific social objectives in telecommunications (in particular delivery of the Universal Service Obligation and continued access by residential consumers to the option of untimed local calls) will continue to be met, but on a more secure legislative basis, and in a more efficient and transparent manner;

       </para>
       <para>
        My following comments address the key features of the Bill against this framework.
       </para>
       <para>
        Network Competition
       </para>
       <para>
        The central feature of the Bill is the framework it provides for the introduction of genuine and sustainable network competition in the shortest time possible. It does this in three ways:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) Licensing
       </para>
       <para>
        In contrast with the 1989 Act, the Bill allows for network competition by giving the Minister the power to license Australian trading corporations as ``general carriers''. A general carrier will have complete freedom to use whatever technology that carrier chooses to deliver the full range of telecommunications services (other than public mobile services, unless it also holds a public mobile licence). The general carriers, which are recognised in the objects of the Bill to be the primary providers of Australia's telecommunications networks and the primary providers of Australia's telecommunications services, will also have certain exclusive rights and powers. I shall discuss these rights and powers later. The Bill provides a similar licensing regime for public mobile carriers with respect to the primary supply of public mobile telecommunications services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill gives the Minister a wide discretion as to the grant of licences. As announced by the Prime Minister, the Government has taken the view that the goal of genuine and sustainable network competition is best served through licensing a single network competitor to the merged Telecom/OTC prior to full competition in 1997. The chief reason for this is that the Government has taken the view that the creation of one strong competitor is the best way of achieving genuine and sustainable network competition quickly in a market the size of Australia's. The aim is to ensure that by 1997 there is a significant, recognised network competitor to Telecom/OTC. Accordingly, on commencement of the Bill, the Government will only be licensing one competitor to Telecom/OTC.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government does not intend to issue further general carrier licences prior to 1997. It will issue only one further mobile licence prior to 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill therefore anticipates, but does not attempt to fully prescribe, the post-1997 environment. As already announced, this will be the subject of a review by the Government prior to 30 June 1997.
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) Access and interconnection
       </para>
       <para>
        The second main feature of the Bill which is intended to promote network competition is the inter-carrier access arrangements in Part 8.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overseas experience, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, has shown that the most important element in introducing genuine and sustainable network competition in the long run where there is an established telecommunications monopoly is to have appropriate interconnection and access arrangements between the carriers. It is widely acknowledged internationally that the arrangements proposed in the Government's decisions of November 1990 will be the most effective, pro-competitive and equitable interconnection arrangements that have been introduced anywhere in the world. The framework provided by Part 8 enables those decisions to be implemented while allowing flexibility for dealing with changing market circumstances, and technological developments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The short term aim of the arrangements is to assist the second carrier in overcoming the formidable advantages associated with Telecom/OTC's control over the customer base, infrastructure and access to information so that the second carrier will be able to compete on terms that are, as nearly as possible, equal. The longer term aim is to create the basis for an open network framework for the provision of telecommunications services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 8 creates two broad categories of access rights. The first is the basic right of any carrier to interconnect its network to that of any other carrier, and to have that other carrier carry and complete calls on its behalf. This right is fully mutual between the carriers and also applies between the general and public mobile carriers. The second, or ``supplementary'' class of rights covers matters relating to supplementary services affecting a carrier's control over the customer base. This is capable of being made carrier specific and in practice will apply only to the provision of supplementary services by Telecom/OTC while it remains the dominant carrier.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Part also allows for disallowable Ministerial determinations on special pricing arrangements that are to apply between the carriers. This power will be used to set out the details that implement the general principle that the second carrier should have access to Telecom/OTC's facilities and supplementary services at directly attributable incremental cost following AUSTEL's report to the Government on this issue in June.
       </para>
       <para>
        These rights will be given practical effect by giving a carrier the right to ask AUSTEL to arbitrate on a dispute that it has with another carrier concerning access and interconnection matters. The Bill provides for extensive procedures governing the way in which such arbitrations are to be conducted, although the general principle is that they are to be conducted in a way that is fair, just, informal, economical and quick. An arbitration will generally be conducted in private. However there is provision for AUSTEL to conduct a public inquiry on a particular issue where AUSTEL considers that this will have a significant and direct impact on consumers, and that the inquiry will not significantly delay the arbitration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Carriers will, in effect, be required to register all access agreements with AUSTEL. These agreements will be public, to the extent that normal commercial confidentiality principles permit. So as to ensure that all agreements actually promote the long term interests of consumers of telecommunications services, AUSTEL will have the ability to refuse to register an access agreement where in AUSTEL's opinion it does not further the objects of Part 8.
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) New AUSTEL functions
       </para>
       <para>
        The third way in which network competition will be enhanced is by giving AUSTEL a charter with a number of pro-competitive functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most important of these new functions is given in clause 37 which charges AUSTEL with the function of promoting competition within the regulatory framework established by the Act. In relation to network competition, AUSTEL has the role of promoting competition between the carriers; of protecting carriers from the misuse of market power by other carriers; and of arbitrating disputes between the carriers. AUSTEL is, therefore, being given a clear mandate to create the conditions necessary for genuine and sustainable network competition between the carriers and is being authorised to take appropriate action to ensure that this occurs. AUSTEL's role and powers in this respect are in addition to the normal application of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the usual powers of the Trade Practices Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTEL is also being given a number of other new powers and functions which are related to the promotion of competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most important of these is AUSTEL's powers in relation to accounting and charging procedures in Division 5 of Part 5. This requires AUSTEL to draw up a chart of accounts and a cost allocation manual. The primary function of these documents will be to ensure full accounting separation of those areas of a carrier's activities that do not face strong competition. AUSTEL will be able to decide on the extent to which a carrier should be made subject to the accounting separation regime. This is because it is likely that for the first few years of its operations the second network carrier will face strong competition from Telecom/OTC in all of its main business activities. There may, however, be reason to apply a degree of accounting separation to the second carrier when the third mobile operator commences operations in 1993, or in order to safeguard satellite service customers in the initial stages of competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 39 of the Bill gives AUSTEL the function of managing numbering. AUSTEL will be required to establish a numbering plan for telecommunications services provided across carrier networks, consulting where appropriate with the Standards Association of Australia which also has a role in relation to certain services. In establishing the plan, AUSTEL is required to have regard to its other relevant functions which would include promoting competition and protecting consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further AUSTEL function given by clauses 40 and 399 will be that of reporting annually to the Minister on the operation of competitive safeguards and carrier performance. As the Minister is required to table the report in Parliament this will ensure that the Parliament and the public are aware of how the competitive safeguards regime is working out in practice. It also ensures that AUSTEL maintains an appropriate level of interest in competition and carrier performance. The fact that this reporting obligation, which also has a consumer protection dimension which I will discuss later, has the status of an AUSTEL function indicates the importance which is placed on it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Service provider competition
       </para>
       <para>
        While the main long-term goal of the new regulatory framework lies in fostering network competition, the Government has also moved to foster competition from other service providers, in a manner consistent with that primary goal. The chief reasons for this are to encourage innovation and diversity in the provision of telecommunications services, and to give the fullest possible degree of flexibility to consumers in the way in which they use telecommunications services derived from carriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill has a number of features for achieving this end.
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) Resale
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the key differences between this Bill and the 1989 Act, both in policy and conceptual terms, has flowed from the Government's decision to remove all restrictions on resale on domestic and international telecommunications capacity currently contained in the Telecommunications Act 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the 1989 Act, only the carriers are permitted to provide so-called ``reserved'' services. Even where a person obtains a basic service from a carrier, that person cannot use the basic service to supply another service unless that service can be classified as a ``value-added'' service.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's resale decision removes that artificial distinction, and allows for much more efficient use of capacity within private networks. This is a very significant liberalisation of existing arrangements and the approach of the Bill to resale is among the most liberal, if not the most liberal, in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to allow resale is given effect by ensuring that the Bill does not apply any restrictions on the supply of services other than those contained in an AUSTEL class licence issued under Part 10 of the Bill. These restrictions are primarily intended to deal with
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) technical and operational matters, so as to ensure the technical integrity and efficiency of public telecommunications networks is maintained and relevant international standards are met;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) the provision of international services, to prevent the misuse of market power by foreign carriers through resale; and to ensure that the agreements that carriers enter into with international cabling consortia cannot be used to achieve effective bypass of the carriers; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) services provided over radiocommunications facilities that are connected to a carrier's network and that have been privately installed. The reason for this restriction is that the Bill, again in contrast to existing arrangements, allows complete freedom for anyone to install radiocommunications facilities and otherwise use radiocommunications services. In the absence of a ``safety net'' there is a danger that such facilities might be used to erode significantly the practical value of the carriers' reserved rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) Unbundling of basic carriage services
       </para>
       <para>
        The second main feature of the Bill designed to promote competition from service providers is the approach in Division 2 of Part 9 towards the controlled unbundling of ``basic carriage services'' (or BCS). BCS is one of the central concepts in the Bill, so I will take some time to explain its functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to allow full resale has essentially been implemented by framing the carriers' reservations (apart from public mobile services and satellite services) in facilities terms, and imposing no restrictions on the persons who may provide services over those facilities. This fulfils the twin objectives of giving the carriers' licences practical value, while allowing resale, as long as the carriers are allowed genuine control over their facilities and are able to exploit the economies of scale and scope inherent in them, at least to provide basic connectivity and carriage services. Clause 237 underlines the carriers' prerogatives in this regard by giving them the ability to refuse to supply particular BCSs that are not included in the carrier's BCS tariff.
       </para>
       <para>
        The BCS concept is essentially a functional description, from the point of view of the service as delivered to the consumer, of basic connectivity and carriage services, on which all commercial telecommunications services are necessarily built. The Bill calls all services that are not BCSs ``higher level services'' (or HLS). The conceptual distinction in the Bill, and the basic reasons for it, reflect the thinking proposed by AUSTEL in its Report to the Minister for Transport and Communications on Resale of 14 December 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        This ability of a carrier to refuse to supply BCSs, while necessary to maintain the practical value of the carrier's rights and thereby to promote network competition, nevertheless has the potential to have significant anti-competitive consequences in markets for other telecommunications services. To address this, the Bill has a procedure under which AUSTEL, on its own initiative or on application, can direct a dominant carrier to supply a particular BCS. This ``unbundling'' regime has two main purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, it will prevent a dominant carrier that is supplying a BCS from precipitately withdrawing that service where this will have significant consequences for existing users of that service.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, it will allow for a structured process for ``unbundling'' of BCSs. ``Unbundling'' in this context means requiring a carrier to make available ``lower level'' BCSs that are necessary to provide other telecommunications services. This process will promote competition by allowing service providers to use these ``building blocks'' to construct other telecommunications services from an equal base.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, however, important that such unbundling of BCSs actually benefits the long term interests of consumers by taking proper account of what is technically practicable, and of the need to promote genuine and sustainable network competition between the carriers by ensuring that their rights have practical value.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once a service has been ``unbundled'' in this way, a directed carrier will have to supply that service on reasonable terms, and will be required to supply the service to itself on the same terms as to all other service providers. This requirement applies automatically (but in a more limited way) to any BCSs that a carrier itself is using to supply an HLS.
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) Safeguards for service providers
       </para>
       <para>
        The third main way in which the Bill fosters service competition from service providers is by giving them, along with other consumers of telecommunications services, a number of targeted safeguards against particular abuses of market power by carriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first safeguard is that a carrier that is in a position to dominate a market for a telecommunications service will not be able to discriminate between customers in that market unless that discrimination can be justified on a cost basis. Furthermore, carriers in general will not be permitted to discriminate against a person for the reason that the person is or wants to be a service provider.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second safeguard is that carriers will be required to tariff their BCSs, and will have incentives to tariff their HLSs. This will make it easier for consumers to obtain information about competing carrier services, and in combination with the discrimination provisions, will provide incentives for a dominant carrier to keep its charges down. A carrier that is in a position to dominate a market for a BCS will be required to charge strictly in accordance with its tariff. A non-dominant carrier will be able to charge below its tariff but not above it. The existing carriers will have 6 months in which to tariff all their existing services following commencement of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third safeguard is that the carriers are under an obligation to connect a service provider unless another carrier is supplying the connection service.
       </para>
       <para>
        Social Objectives
       </para>
       <para>
        While the main thrust of the Bill is directed towards introducing a more competitive framework for supplying telecommunications services as the best means of meeting consumers' interests in the long term, the reforms also aim to improve the regulatory arrangements for delivering certain key objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) The Universal Service Obligation
       </para>
       <para>
        The most important of these is Telecom's Universal Service Obligation (USO). In his November 1990 Statement, the Minister for Transport and Communications gave the commitment, on behalf of the Government, that:
       </para>
       <para>
        - community service obligations (CSOs) would be maintained, in particular to rural and regional areas, to pensioners and to people with disabilities;
       </para>
       <para>
        - Telecom/OTC would be required to continue to provide and maintain its basic telephone services to residential and business customers throughout Australia; and
       </para>
       <para>
        - the management and funding of community service obligations would be considered by an Interdepartmental Committee chaired by the Department, and that the IDC, in preparing its report, would have regard to the notation to the ALP policy that the cost for the competitor to interconnect into Telecom/OTC's network should underpin Telecom/OTC's community service obligations on a pro-rata basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        After full consideration of the IDC's report, the Government decided that the most appropriate and least administratively-complex way of giving effect to its aims in the continued funding and delivery of universal telephone service would be:
       </para>
       <para>
        - to obligate Telecom/OTC to continue to provide a standard telephone service between places in Australia including payphones
       </para>
       <para>
        - to require the second carrier to pay Telecom/OTC a fee which covers an equitable share of Telecom/OTC's costs of fulfilling its universal service obligation with the payment to be in direct proportion to minutes of interconnect time between each carrier's trunk/international network and all local access networks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 13 of the Bill gives effect to these decisions. This empowers the Minister to declare a carrier to be the Universal Service Carrier for Australia. Telecom/OTC will be designated as this carrier. Clause 292 makes it a ``prescribed carrier obligation'' of the Universal Service Carrier's licence to fulfil the USO. The USO has two strands:
       </para>
       <para>
        - the obligation to supply the standard telephone service to people in Australia; and
       </para>
       <para>
        - to supply payphones in a way that ensures that they are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis. This can be backed up by a Ministerial determination that payphones must be installed in specified places.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has the effect of placing the USO on a more secure legislative basis that under current arrangements, where their management and delivery are largely at Telecom's discretion. This is because any person may complain to AUSTEL about a possible breach of this licence condition. If AUSTEL finds that the carrier has unreasonably failed to fulfil its USO, AUSTEL must direct the carrier to fulfil it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The net costs incurred in fulfilling the universal service obligation are to be calculated by participating carriers using a long term avoidability methodology. These are the costs that will be used by AUSTEL, along with the number of minutes of interconnect time, to determine the pro-rata contribution of all participating carriers in the levy. For practical purposes, interconnect time is to be measured as the number of minutes of timed traffic interconnected by a carrier.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government decided, in December 1989, that Telecom is to use the avoidable cost approach in determining the costs incurred in delivering universal service. Accordingly, this Bill places in legislation the requirement that a universal service carrier (in this case, Telecom/OTC), calculate its net costs using a long term avoidable cost approach. This will require Telecom/OTC, in calculating its USO costs in a particular area, only to take into account the justifiable net costs it need not have incurred had the services not been provided to that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The arrangements, as proposed, give AUSTEL the responsibility for auditing the net costs and timed traffic figures provided by the carriers. However, with the Government's dual aim in mind of, on the one hand, delivering the universal service obligation to the highest standard and at the least cost possible and, on the other, of making the arrangements as open and transparent as possible, the Bill also requires AUSTEL to make available to the public, and to participating carriers, information about the basis and methods of assessment, in as much detail as it thinks appropriate, bearing in mind the need to protect a carrier's valid commercial or other interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) Untimed local calls
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 72 and 73 make it a licence condition of all general carriers that they offer residential customers continued access to untimed local calls as a payment option. In the case of Telecom/OTC the price of Fuese untimed local calls will be governed by the operation of the price caps.
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) Quality of Service
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTEL is to be given the additional specific consumer protection function of developing indicative quality of service, or performance standards relating to the standard telephone service; services ancillary to the standard telephone services (such as directory assistance); and any other services AUSTEL considers appropriate. While these standards will not be binding on a carrier (unless they are included in licence conditions), AUSTEL will gather data and will use these standards as a key test of carrier performance for the purposes of its annual report to the Minister on carrier performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Licensing
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the important features of the new Bill is that it establishes a licensing regime for carriers with broad discretions for the Minister to impose and vary licence conditions. However, it is important to note that a number of key licence conditions, in particular those relating to the USO and untimed local calls, have been included in the Bill and therefore will not be capable of change, except by the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other matters likely to be dealt with in licence conditions are listed in subclause 63(4). They include
       </para>
       <para>
        - the term of a licence
       </para>
       <para>
        - industry development
       </para>
       <para>
        - foreign ownership or control
       </para>
       <para>
        - supplementary access rights (for interconnection purposes)
       </para>
       <para>
        - consumer inquiry and complaints procedures (such as a requirement that a carrier develop a Code of Practice for handling such inquiries and complaints)
       </para>
       <para>
        - compliance with technical standards
       </para>
       <para>
        - law enforcement issues
       </para>
       <para>
        - geographical limitations on a licensee's scope of action
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also intended that there will be licence obligations on AUSSAT relating to Remote Commercial Television Services, the ABC's Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service, and defence and aviation requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of issues on this list (which is not exhaustive) are clearly going to require further detailed work. Others will be issues to be negotiated during the sale process for AUSSAT and will be the subject of a commercial contract.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government recognises that there will be many occasions where a public process would be desirable to assist in clarifying the issues involved with important licence conditions. Clause 69 provides for a Minister to request AUSTEL to conduct a public inquiry before the Minister varies an important licence condition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also recognises that carriers have a legitimate interest in regulatory stability in order that they can make sensible investment decisions. To this end, clause 68 requires a Minister to consult with a carrier before varying a licence condition. Clause 70 allows a Minister to enter into an agreement with the carrier about the way in which the Minister will exercise a particular licensing power. At the end of the day, though, it is not appropriate to unduly fetter the Minister's ability to impose or vary licence conditions as there may be important issues of public policy at stake.
       </para>
       <para>
        Public Processes
       </para>
       <para>
        In general the Bill adopts a more open approach to policy formulation than the 1989 Act. The following measures have been adopted (in addition to those in the 1989 Act) to achieve this:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) A new Part 14 of the Bill has been added to give AUSTEL a simple and straightforward public inquiry process. This is largely intended to codify AUSTEL's existing practices, although some new features of the Bill (e.g. unbundling of BCSs) will depend on a public inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) AUSTEL will be required to keep a simple and publicly accessible register of complaints and investigations under Part 15 of the Act. This will also assist AUSTEL in meeting its annual reporting obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) AUSTEL will be required to keep a register of access agreements between the carriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) Carriers will be required to keep a publicly available schedule of BCS tariffs and to file these with AUSTEL. They will have substantial incentives to include their standard terms and conditions in these tariffs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Carriers' exclusive rights, powers and immunities
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Bill the carriers' exclusive rights are essentially based on a facilities reservation only, rather than a services and facilities reservation as in the 1989 Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The general carriers will have the exclusive right to install ``line links'' between ``distinct places''. A line link essentially is any combination of connected wires or cables that is used or intended for use in carrying electromagnetic energy. A ``distinct place'' will be
       </para>
       <para>
        - any freehold or leasehold title; or
       </para>
       <para>
        - any combination of adjoining freehold or leasehold titles that are occupied or principally used by the same person; or that are the subject of a Ministerial determination (which is subject to certain limitations).
       </para>
       <para>
        Division 2 of Part 2 makes it clear that the network termination point (or network boundary) for a line link in a distinct place will be the main distribution frame or telephone socket as appropriate. The regulations will allow this to be changed both to take account of changing technology, and to give effect to the Government's decision that from 1 July 1993, the network termination point for new telephone services be the property boundary, unless the customer contracts with a licensed carrier to supply an alternative point within the property.
       </para>
       <para>
        The general carriers will also have the exclusive right to be the ``primary suppliers'' of services that use satellite facilities. I say primary supply because, of course, resale of such services will be permitted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Public mobile carriers will have exclusive rights to supply public mobile telecommunications services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The formulation of the reservations based on these concepts remedies a range of problems under the existing Act and allows for an appropriate level of flexibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exceptions to the carriers' reservations remain broadly as they are under the 1989 Act with the following extensions
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) the Defence forces and the Civil Aviation Authority have been given special purpose exceptions to the carriers' reservations
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) a person who has an exception to a carrier's reservation will now be able to supply a service to a carrier or dispose of his or her facilities to a carrier
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) the exception granted to broadcasters has been widened to allow broadcasters to supply programs to each other by means of their own exempted line links and to use those line links in relation to the supply of Ancillary Communications Services
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) the Government's international Private Satellite Earth Station policy has been formalised as an exception to the carriers' satellite reservation. Any person will be able to obtain an international satellite service from any satellite operator (whether or not a carrier). For the purposes of resale, these services will be treated in a manner that is directly analogous to other interconnected radcom services, that is they will be subject to use restrictions under AUSTEL's services class licence
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) AUSTEL will be able to issue authorisations, under Ministerial direction (which is subject to certain constraints), for persons other than carriers to install exempted classes of line links or use satellite services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing land access power of Telecom under Part 8 of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989 will be extended to the general carriers with compensation agreed or assessed with a right of appeal to a State or Federal Court This is essential to carrier activities and to allow the second carrier to roll out its network.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom's pre-existing immunity from suit is removed. Any exclusion or limitation of liability becomes a matter of normal contractual principles and negotiation. AUSTEL is empowered to determine appropriate ceilings in respect of tort liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom's exemption from State and Territory laws has been replaced by a more focussed and balanced regime. Essentially, the regulations will be able to specify that certain network related activities are exempt from State and Territory laws, and a carrier will be able to engage in those activities, despite any State or Territory law. This will be balanced by a National Code of Practice for the carriers, to be discussed with the States and Territories, which will impose parallel obligations on the carriers to the extent that this is warranted. However, a carrier will not be subject to any State or Territory laws that discriminate against the carriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Enforcement
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill contains new enforcement mechanisms that reflect the changed nature of the regulatory environment. Essentially, the chief sanction against a carrier is based on AUSTEL's ability to direct a carrier. The sanction for a carrier failing to comply with an AUSTEL direction is enforced by AUSTEL having the ability to take the carrier to court for a civil pecuniary penalty of up to $5 million, an injunction or a declaration.
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTEL enforces licence conditions in a similar way. First by investigating to satisfy itself that a breach has occurred, then issuing a direction to the carrier to rectify the breach. It is only if the carrier does not rectify the breach that AUSTEL can go to Court. The Minister also has the power to enforce licence conditions by taking a carrier directly to Court (the same penalties apply) without the need for an investigation. However, this is intended to be a reserve power.
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTEL has also been given certain limited powers of entry and seizure in relation to its technical regulation functions. The reason for this is that AUSTEL's practical ability to enforce its technical regulation powers are, under the 1989 Act very limited. These additional powers are necessary to give meaning to AUSTEL's function in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Re-enactment of existing parts
       </para>
       <para>
        Essentially, Parts 5 to 8 of the 1989 Act relating to technical regulation, AUSTEL investigations, AUSTEL's constitution, and miscellaneous matters have been re-enacted. The following changes are worth noting, however.
       </para>
       <para>
        With technical regulation, AUSTEL has been given the power, at Ministerial direction, to formulate technical network standards. It is a condition of a carrier's licence that the carrier comply with any such standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTEL has also been given the power, at its own initiative, on application or on Ministerial direction to exempt certain types of equipment and customer cabling from the scope of technical regulation requirements where such equipment does not have the ability to affect the integrity or efficiency of a carrier's network.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Bill comes into force the Minister has indicated that he intends to issue a direction to AUSTEL under relevant provisions to exempt computing equipment and equipment in broadcasters studios that are beyond an appropriate line isolating device.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to AUSTEL's Constitution, there are some minor changes relating to AUSTEL membership and AUSTEL finances. In relation to membership, the changes are intended to clarify the status of associate members. The new provisions relating to AUSTEL finances are standard provisions relating to the financial arrangements for statutory authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other issues
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two other features of the Bill that deserve comment. The first relates to the Minister's general powers of direction to AUSTEL under clauses 49 and 50 of the Bill. These powers of direction re-enact sections 28 and 29 of the 1989 Act essentially without change. These powers of direction were somewhat controversial at the time of passage of the 1989 Act, however their use has attracted no criticism subsequently. Section 28 has been used to give effect to the Industry Development Arrangements for customer equipment. Section 29 has been used to direct AUSTEL to undertake a number of studies and reports. These provisions play an important function in ensuring that AUSTEL remains accountable and takes account of the full range of policy perspectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another feature worthy of note is the International Code of Practice in Division 4 of Part 5. This is intended to give the Government flexibility in dealing with possible misuses of market power by foreign carriers that become possible with the advent of full resale. It is the Government's intention, however, to impose minimal restrictions on those carriers and trades where reciprocal rights of resale are permitted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Financial Impact
       </para>
       <para>
        It is estimated that the measures in this Bill which give AUSTEL new functions will require additional expenditure on AUSTEL of $4.6 million in the 1991/92 financial year and $3.8 million in the following financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is expected, however, that the increase in expenditure on AUSTEL will be more than offset by the additional revenue raised from the carrier licence fees imposed by the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Bill 1991, and the fees imposed under the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill 1991 and the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Bill 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures in the Bill which introduce competition are expected to have a major financial impact on Australia's telecommunications industry, with new players entering the market and greater efficiency in the provision of services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increased efficiency in the telecommunications industry and the new services likely to be offered by the players in the industry as a result of this Bill are designed to enhance the long term competitiveness of the entire Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of financial impact on the ordinary customer, no householder or ordinary subscriber in rural areas will be disadvantaged by the reforms. All residential consumers who currently have access to untimed local calls will continue to have that access.

        Mr President
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a companion piece of legislation to the Telecommunications Bill 1991. It provides for the setting of fees for a range of applications made to the Australian Telecommunications Authority (AUSTEL), and updates previous legislation to this effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fees will continue to be payable in relation to the categories of applications for which fees have been payable up to now will continue including applications relating to customer equipment permits, cabling licences and test house accreditation. Fees will also apply to the same types of applications relating to eligible services under the Telecommunications Act 1991 as applied to applications relating to value added and private network services under the Telecommunications Act 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, fees will apply to applications for authorisations for the use of certain line links and satellite facilities, and for enrolment as a supplier of public access cordless telephone services.

       <para>
        This is a companion piece of legislation to the Telecommunications Bill 1991, and provides that the holders of general telecommunications licences or public mobile licences must pay a fee to the Commonwealth for the licence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amounts of the fees, or the formula by which the fees are determined, are to be set by regulation. It is intended that the amount or the formula determined by the regulations should represent a reasonable estimate of the administrative costs borne by AUSTEL in directly regulating the activities of the carriers. Fees prescribed for the holders of telecommunications licences may differ from those provided for the holders of public mobile licences.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an upper limit on the total of the fees that may become payable under this legislation in any one financial year. This limit is the amount of AUSTEL's appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the previous financial year.

        This is a companion piece of legislation to the Telecommunications Bill 1991 and provides for the payment of fees to the Commonwealth for the allocation of numbers for public telecommunications services. The allocation of numbers will be the responsibility of AUSTEL under Division 2 of Part 11 of the Telecommunications Act 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bill provides for different levels of fees to be charged for ordinary and ``special'' numbers.

       <para>
        The fees for numbers will be fixed by, or determined under, regulation. The maximum fee that can be fixed for ordinary numbers will be $2,000. In the case of special numbers, the regulations will be able to provide for a premium, a tender process, or a public auction for fixing the fee.

        TELECOMMUNICATIONS (UNIVERSAL SERVICE LEVY) BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a companion piece of legislation to the Telecommunications Bill 1991, and imposes a levy in connection with ensuring the future delivery of the universal service obligation in Australia as defined in the Telecommunications Bill 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bill allows for a carrier to be declared to be a participating carrier for a particular financial year, and for a carrier to be liable to pay an amount equal to the carriers levy debit balance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Details of the assessment, collection and distribution of the universal service levy are contained in Part 13 of the Telecommunications Bill 1991, as is the formula to be used by AUSTEL to calculate levy credits and debits. Briefly, the formula allows levy credits and debits to be calculated based on the net costs incurred by carriers in delivering the universal service obligation, and apportioning liability for those costs to each carrier according to minutes of interconnect time. A levy is payable, therefore, only where a carrier's liability outweighs its net costs incurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        In combination with the Telecommunications Bill 1991, this bill will enable effect to be given to the Government's commitment to the future funding and delivery of the universal service obligation, and to its decision that the second telecommunications carrier should contribute on a pro-rata basis to the costs of providing universal service.
       </para>
       <para>
        FINANCIAL IMPACT
       </para>
       <para>
        The relative contributions of participating carriers will depend on the carriers identifying loss making areas of their operations where they have a universal service obligation, the extent of those losses, and the amount of interconnect time between the carriers' trunk and international networks and all local access networks. Accordingly, it is impossible to quantify what amounts will be payable under the levy. It can be expected, however, that as the second general carrier's business grows, its contribution to cover the net cost of lossmaking services will increase.

        AUSTRALIAN AND OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President
       </para>
       <para>
        The primary purpose of this bill is to permit the amalgamation of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation (Telecom) and OTC Limited (OTC). The new corporate entity will be named the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. The merger was one of the central elements of the Prime Minister's Parliamentary Statement of 8 November 1990 on Transport and Telecommunications reform. Further details were spelled out in the announcement of the Minister for Transport and Communications of the same date.
       </para>
       <para>
        This bill requires that the new company remain in full public ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been a central tenet throughout the Government's reform processes that a strong public sector presence in Australian telecommunications be maintained.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to retain the merged company in public ownership will enable the Government to meet the guarantee that no householder or ordinary subscriber in rural areas will be disadvantaged by the introduction of competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is only through public ownership that the Government can satisfactorily ensure that the requirement that a standard telephone service be available to all residential and business customers throughout Australia is met. Public ownership allows direct control over this universal service obligation to the clear benefit of the people of Australia. Privatisation of our national carrier would seriously weaken the Government's ability to require that carrier to continue to meet important social goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Public ownership also maintains a capacity for the Government to exercise appropriate oversight of the new company's market conduct with respect to the emergence of competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Retention of the new company in full public ownership will also mean that Australian taxpayers will continue to receive dividends in their capacity as shareholders. This means that future generations of Australians will continue to benefit from the rapid growth in telecommunications which this package of reforms will engender.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major focus of this package is introducing competition, not privatisation for its own sake. The experience of other countries that have simultaneously attempted to privatise telecommunications companies and to introduce competition has been that competition has always been compromised. This package reflects our view that the fundamental issue is to get the regulatory framework right.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's decision to merge Telecom and OTC followed consideration last year of the review of the ownership and structural arrangements among the Government owned telecommunications carriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government intends that the merger of Telecom and OTC not represent a mere amalgamation of the two carriers. It is far more than that. The Government is seeking to bring these two carriers together to create a new entity with a streamlined organisational structure, which is capable of being not only an efficient national carrier but a major player in the telecommunications trade in this region.
       </para>
       <para>
        This company must operate in a vigorous new competitive environment. It must therefore develop a genuinely competitive ethos and an overriding commitment to meeting the needs of Australian users. To do this, it is essential that the board and management of the new company pursue the achievement of standards of technical quality, service and price which are not only better than those achieved by Telecom and OTC individually but are equal to the best in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is expected that significant synergies will be realised by removing the current distinction between domestic and international telecommunication services. A united entity, exploiting the existing abilities and expertise of Telecom and OTC, will be able to provide customers with a comprehensive, globally interconnected service.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will also provide the foundation for an increased export focus within the Australian telecommunications industry by building on the successes so far of Telecom Australia International and OTC International.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first stage in the merging of Telecom and OTC commenced with the appointment in December 1990 of an ``Interim Board'' comprising representatives of both the Telecom and OTC Boards. The Interim Board's primary task is to advise the Government on the corporate and management structure which will best facilitate the merger of the two organisations and to prepare Telecom and OTC to face a competitive environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Interim Board is progressively refining its position on a proposed structure for the new company. The Board aims to ensure that the new structure will provide focus, accountability, and authority so as to achieve strategic business objectives. As well, the structure of the new company will promote transparency of revenues, costs, and assets to support accountability. A further aim will be to ensure that the new company's performance in regard to prices, costs, productivity, and quality of service is comparable with the best in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new entity will be established, as a company with share capital, under normal Corporations Law processes. Consequently, the fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of the company will be the same as those applying to directors of private sector companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The operation of this bill is directed at vesting in the new company all the rights, property, staff and liabilities of Telecom and OTC. It is the intention of the relevant provisions of the bill, that the new company be recognised as the legal successor of Telecom and OTC. In effect, the new company ``stands in the shoes'' of Telecom and OTC in respect of all their contractual arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision is expressly made to ensure preservation of the rights, accrued entitlements and continuity of service of all Telecom and OTC staff transferred to the new company.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a deliberate policy decision of the Government that the merger provisions of the bill will not commence until a day to be fixed by proclamation rather than commencing automatically after 6 months from the passage of the bill. This is so that proclamation can be made to coincide with the certification by AUSTEL that interconnection and equal access arrangements between the networks of Telecom and OTC and the second carrier are fully in place in all capital cities and that a timetable for the early installation of such arrangements for provincial cities has been agreed to by Telecom and OTC. This approach recognises that the terms and conditions of interconnection are fundamental to the successful launch of the second carrier. In short, there is a powerful incentive on Telecom and OTC to move quickly on interconnection as they will be required to continue to operate as separate entities until the AUSTEL certification is issued.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to emphasise that this merger is not simply about subsuming one government-owned organisation into another. The merger is concerned with the creation of a new organisation that will be much more than a simple ``adding together'' of OTC and Telecom. The Minister for Transport and Communications has previously stated that the Government is interested in achieving the creation of a dynamic, customer-driven, commercial entity. I reiterate that our goal is exactly that, and I am confident that it will be realised.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bill I am about to introduce empowers the Minister for Transport and Communications to give directions to the new company in relation to its operations when it is in the public interest to do so. This emphasises the Government's commitment to providing the Australian consumer with the most efficient and responsive telecommunications carrier possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, this provision should be viewed as primarily providing the Minister with a reserve power. Indeed the whole thrust of our competitive reforms will ensure that the Board, management and staff of the new company will have every incentive to ensure that the new company performs efficiently and is responsive to customer requirements. If the new company is not responsive to the community's expectations it will inevitably see its market share and market power diminish.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bill also empowers the Minister for Transport and Communications to regulate charges levied by Telecom or OTC (or by the new company after the merger) for a telecommunications service or facility. This provision continues existing arrangements. At present, Telecom and OTC are subject to price cap arrangements which work to keep average price increases to consumers well below the inflation rate and thereby encourage Telecom and OTC to actively pursue improvements in their productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of Telecom, control is also exercised through the notification and disallowance powers of the Minister in relation to a number of reserved services.

        Both the price cap and notification and disallowance arrangements will continue until 1 July 1992, when the number of services regulated by notification and disallowance of charges will be reduced, with greater emphasis on the price cap mechanism.
       </para>
       <para>
        The price control mechanisms are included in this bill rather than in the Telecommunications bill because they apply only to Telecom and OTC (and, following the merger, the new company). This reflects the fact that as long as Telecom and OTC retain substantial market power it is necessary and appropriate to be able to influence their pricing practices. It can be expected that as the market presence and power of the second and subsequent network providers grows, the need for these provisions will diminish. Ultimately they will be repealed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In opening the telecommunications sector to more competition, the Government has been conscious of the need to create, as far as possible, a fair basis for the efficient emergence of competition between the two general carriers. Accordingly, the Government gave careful consideration to which laws and policies should, or should not, apply to the new company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because it is being established as a company under the Corporations Law, the new company will be automatically subject to certain laws which Telecom, as a statutory authority, was not.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time, some exemptions from Commonwealth, State and Territory laws are carried over in this bill and further exemptions may be accorded by regulation. Such exemptions will be kept to a minimum and will only be provided in cases where exemption raises no significant problems but where the cost to the new company of complying with the particular legislation would be particularly onerous and would result in substantial flow-on to customers; where the introduction of effective competition would be hampered; or where an exemption is essential in order to satisfy other Government policy objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        A provision in the bill also requires that the new company submit its annual report and financial statements to the Minister for Transport and Communications. The Government will require that the directors of the company will include in those financial statements a full consolidation of the accounts of all subsidiaries and all joint ventures (including where the company only has a minority shareholding) of the new company. I consider it entirely appropriate that a Commonwealth-owned company should conform with the highest accounting and corporate conduct standards possible. In any event, under forthcoming amendments to the Corporations Law covering consolidation of subsidiaries, the new company will be obliged to compile financial statements in this form.

        Direct Commonwealth outlays will be minimal, being essentially limited to the costs of establishing and registering the new company.
       </para>
       <para>
        As regards additional revenue to the Commonwealth, a fee will be paid to the Government as a result of the merger of Telecom and OTC. The level of that fee will be set by the Government following consideration of advice from the Interim Board on the likely financial results of the merger.
       </para>

        The bill provides for certain exemptions from Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes with regard to the succession process, recognising there has been no change in beneficial ownership of the carriers.

        VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (REWRITE) TRANSITION BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is the second of three Bills required to give effect to the ``plain English'' rewrite of Part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It provides the necessary legal machinery for the transition from the former Part III to the new plain English Part III. In keeping with the promise I gave to the ex-service community, the Bill contains no changes to policy. It does, however, ensure that changes to the VEA arising from the 1990 Budget Sittings are included in the rewritten Part III.
       </para>
       <para>
        The primary objective of the Bill is to:
       </para>
       <para>
        - make the necessary savings and transitional provisions to ensure that existing rights are protected;
       </para>
       <para>
        - add ``plain English'' indexation provisions and 1990 Budget amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991 (the Rewrite Bill);
       </para>
       <para>
        - make consequential amendments to other Parts of the VEA, other Veterans' Affairs legislation and other Commonwealth Acts; and
       </para>
       <para>
        - make minor technical amendments to the Rewrite Bill;
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will ensure that:
       </para>
       <para>
        - service pension processes begun under specific provisions of the VEA prior to the commencement of the rewritten Part III on 1 July 1991 will continue to be operative after that date under the equivalent provisions of the rewritten Part III without any break in continuity;
       </para>
       <para>
        - all legislation containing references to the former Part III are updated to reflect the structural and other changes to the rewrite of Part III; and
       </para>
       <para>
        - the Rewrite Bill as introduced is amended to correct any minor drafting or unintentional errors.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, Mr President, the Bill reflects the undertaking I gave to the ex-service community at the beginning of the exercise in 1990 that the rewrite of Part III would not involve any policy changes. My Department has discussed the development of the Bill with ex-service organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill therefore has no financial impact for the Government or veterans and their dependants.
       </para>

        I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.

        CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 (``the Act''), to:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) implement certain reforms to the current anti-dumping/subsidisation regime which were announced by the Government in the 12 March Industry Statement,
       </para>
       <para>
        and
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) effect technical drafting changes to the internal body search provisions of the Act to clarify the nature and function of judges' orders made under those provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed amendments to Part XVB of the Act, relating to the anti-dumping and subsidisation provisions, focus on three aspects of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing system:
       </para>
       <para>
        - Clause 7 of the Bill proposes the inclusion of several new subsections modelled on the relevant sections of the United States Tariff Act of 1930, to expand the definition of an Australian industry, and thus effectively allow material injury suffered by vertically integrated agricultural industries as a result of the dumping or subsidisation of processed agricultural products to be taken into consideration when determining the material injury caused by the dumping of such processed products;
       </para>
       <para>
        - Clause 8 of the Bill proposes to simplify the determination of provisional dumping measures by providing for the calculation of a full dumping margin at the preliminary finding stage of a dumping or subsidisation inquiry;
       </para>
       <para>
        and
       </para>
       <para>
        - Clause 9 of the Bill proposes a modification to the provision in the Act relating to the 3 year sunset period for dumping measures, to ensure that any such measures which may be in place for a particular product apply for 3 years, unless earlier revoked.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making these changes, the Australian Government retains its commitment to promoting a fair and orderly international trading system under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Government will, as appropriate, review and if necessary amend Australia's legislative provisions and actions taken under the Act in the light of future developments in the international economic and trading arena, particularly in regard to our continuing obligations under the GATT and the GATT Anti-Dumping Code.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principal objective of the anti-dumping amendments in this Bill is to provide that where agricultural producers who are vertically integrated with the processors to whom they sell their products suffer material injury as a result of dumping or subsidisation of processed products, the agricultural producers will be included as part of the relevant Australian industry and thus will be taken into consideration in cases involving those imported processed products.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new provision in Clause 7 of the Bill will apply to those involved in the production of crops (including viticulture, horticulture and apiculture), as well as the rearing of livestock, and the conduct of forestry and fishing operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This change recognises the vulnerability of vertically integrated agricultural producers, who are generally price takers in their markets, with the prices they receive dependent on the prices their buyers are able to command for their processed products. Agricultural producers can, therefore, be materially injured as a result of the impact of dumping or subsidisation on the processors to whom they sell their produce.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new provision in relation to the definition of ``industry'' has been modelled on existing United States legislation which serves a similar purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        It includes strict tests of vertical integration. For a primary producer to be considered part of a processed agricultural product industry, the raw agricultural goods of the primary producer must be devoted substantially or completely to the processed agricultural goods and the processed goods must be derived substantially or completely from the raw agricultural goods. In addition, vertical integration is subject to an economic test requiring either a close relationship between the movement in the prices of the raw agricultural goods and the processed goods, or that the raw agricultural goods constitute a significant proportion of the production cost of the processed agricultural goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second objective of the anti-dumping amendments in this Bill relates to the three year sunset provision on anti-dumping and countervailing measures. This was introduced into the Australian system in 1988 as a safeguard against the use of anti-dumping and countervailing measures as a means of long term industry protection. The Government continues to regard the sunset provision in Section 269TM of the Act as a valuable aspect of the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, however, new anti-dumping or countervailing measures imposed while a measure is in place against the same product from a different source may only be applied for as long as the existing measure on that product remains in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The implications of this are that, where companies engaged in injurious dumping into Australia seek to avoid duties by relocating their operations, any new dumping measures imposed on the relocated source will terminate at the same time as the original measure-no matter how short a time the new measure has been in place. Given the time, effort and cost involved in pursuing action against dumping, the shortened life of such anti-dumping measures is a disincentive for Australian industry to seek action where companies dumping products move their source to avoid the penalties for dumping.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 9 of the Bill will therefore ensure that, except in the case of a successful request for revocation, all anti-dumping and countervailing measures will be applied for the full three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, with regard to the anti-dumping amendments in this Bill, Clause 8 effectively provides that the Australian Customs Service will no longer calculate ``non-injurious'' free on board values for the purpose of setting provisional dumping measures. While that calculation, which attempts to set the price at which a product could be exported to Australia without causing injury to the Australian industry, will continue to be used at the final finding stage for the setting of dumping or countervailing duties, the elimination of it and use instead of the full margin of dumping or subsidisation at the preliminary finding stage will simplify the investigation process and will assist with the reduction in the time taken to process anti-dumping and countervailing cases.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other amendments proposed by this Bill effect technical drafting changes to the new internal body search provisions of Part XII of the Act, and relate in particular to the conferral of power on judges to make the detention and internal search orders which were part of the Customs (Detention and Search) Act 1990, which was assented to in October last year, and commenced operation on 24 April this year. These amendments, contained in clauses 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Bill, are explained in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.

        NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill gives effect to a number of Government initiatives relating to nursing homes and to the domiciliary nursing care benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill aims to change the Commonwealth nursing home benefit arrangements for a specified number of government nursing homes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of these amendments is to allow payment of increased Commonwealth nursing home benefits to a special category of government nursing homes, to be referred to as adjusted fee government nursing homes. The increased benefit will be paid on the same general basis as that paid to non-government nursing homes, and will be based on the CAM system and a modification of the SAM system currently used for non-government homes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth nursing home benefits paid in respect of residents of government nursing homes have been frozen at November 1984 levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 1987, the Government has progressively taken steps to introduce an equitable national standard funding approach to financing nursing home care. This approach links Commonwealth funding to the care needs of individual nursing home residents. Quality of life and quality of care standards are a key element of the Government's policy on nursing home care.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new arrangements will result in a higher level of benefit for these adjusted fee government homes. The higher level of benefit will only apply to a limited number of recently established smaller government homes which are likely to meet the Commonwealth's outcome standards for quality of care and quality of life. The nursing homes to become adjusted fee government nursing homes are listed in this Bill. This list will become a schedule to the Act. For these homes the new rate of benefit will apply retrospectively to 1 January 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        Payment of higher levels of nursing home benefits to this limited number of government nursing homes will be defrayed by the offset provided by the relevant State Government's withdrawal of a number of other government nursing home beds in that State. The only long term financial impact will be through the routine process of indexation which is currently applied to non-government nursing home funding, and will now apply to adjusted fee government nursing homes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several amendments are proposed in this Bill for the exempt nursing home arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government introduced the exempt nursing homes provisions last year. These cater for residents who wish to pay a higher resident contribution in return for receiving a higher level of accommodation and services. However, experience in the operation of these provisions has shown that they do not adequately cater for those people who did not choose to enter an exempt home, but were already in the home at the time it became exempt.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the existing legislation, a resident in a nursing home at the time it is given exempt bed status can remain in the home for two years after that date without paying an additional contribution. Beyond that period they are automatically classified as exempt and so must pay the additional contribution or leave the home. Many of these people cannot afford the additional contribution, and so must leave the home.
       </para>
       <para>
        This provision has caused distress to many of the residents of the homes which were given exempt status last year, and to their relatives. The Bill proposes changes to the legislation to allow residents in homes given exempt bed status in the future to stay permanently without paying the additional exempt bed resident contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the current legislation, if a home's approval as exempt expires and is not renewed, its exempt residents will immediately cease to be exempt. These people chose to enter that home specifically to obtain the additional accommodation and services an exempt home provides, and it is reasonable that they be allowed to remain exempt for as long as they stay in the home. This would also ease the home's transition to non-exempt status. This Bill will implement these changes sought by the Industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently if a nursing home, in its application for exempt status, makes an error in the list of additional accommodation and services it promises to provide, it is bound by that list. The Bill will give the Minister the power to amend this list if the proprietor so requests.
       </para>
       <para>
        When a nursing home applies for exempt status it promises to provide certain services. If the home then does not provide these services the Minister can currently take no effective action to remedy this situation. People choosing to enter exempt homes deserve better protection than this. Accordingly the Bill will allow the Minister to remove a home's exempt status where it does not meet the conditions under which it was given this status.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other related changes in the Bill in relation to exempt homes improve the safeguards for residents in exempt homes and make minor changes to assist the proprietors of exempt homes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also introduces an amendment to allow certain payments to nursing homes outside the fees and benefits system. This is a purely machinery amendment, with no policy or funding implications. It is designed solely to reduce the administrative workload on the Department and on the Industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently all nursing homes are eligible for additional funding to assist them to employ a registered nurse at all times. Only the smaller homes, however, need this assistance, so the funding formula is such that only these smaller homes receive it. The funding formula and other necessary details are set out in Principles formulated pursuant to the Act. The Bill retains this situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, currently the additional funding is provided by way of a variation to the home's approved fees, which means that, for all homes receiving this funding, the fees change each month. These fees have to be authorised, fed into the computer and notified to the home. This creates considerable work for the Department. It also creates considerable work for the Industry, which must change its billing arrangements each month to allow for this. This Bill will allow the additional funding to be provided directly, without the need to change the home's fees.
       </para>
       <para>
        A similar situation applies for some small nursing homes, which are receiving additional funding to assist them to achieve financial viability. The Bill retains the existing arrangements for determining eligibility and the level of additional funding, and allows this funding to be provided without the need to change the home's fees every month.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also clarifies the Commonwealth's power to recover overpayments from nursing homes.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill also strengthens the legal power of the Government to take action against nursing homes with poor standards of care. In a small number of cases, nursing home proprietors have not provided the quality of life and care expected by the Government. As the Commonwealth subsidises each resident in a nursing home an average of twenty three thousand dollars per year (as well as the resident's contribution from their pension), it is essential for the Commonwealth to be in a position to ensure accountability for the funds it makes available and to protect the rights of a potentially powerless group of individuals in our community.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill makes it clear that the satisfaction of the Commonwealth outcome standards is a condition of approval of all Commonwealth funded nursing homes. It also clarifies the ability of the Commonwealth either to take sanctions action against the home or, if necessary, to withdraw or suspend a nursing home's approval to receive Commonwealth funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        A minor amendment is also included in this Bill to ensure that the role of the Community Visitor, as spelled out in the Act, does not conflict with the role of Standards Monitoring Teams, and Departmental Complaints Officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Changes to the method of approving applications for domiciliary nursing care benefit are also contained in this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the National Health Act as it currently stands, the Secretary's power to approve a person for domiciliary nursing care benefit can only be delegated to a medical practitioner employed by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed amendment will have the effect of extending this delegation to registered nurses. Delegates will also no longer be required to be employed in a Commonwealth Department. This will allow the Secretary to delegate this power to medical practitioners and registered nurses who are not officers of the Department, but who may, for example, be employees of a State or Territory Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since a decision to approve an application for domiciliary nursing care benefit is primarily a decision about the need for continuing nursing care, it is appropriate that nurses be included as delegates of the Secretary. Medical certificates, however, will still be required with every application.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         â€”Mr Chairman, you might appreciate that when I was speaking just before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was answering a matter that was raised by Senator Walters concerning a letter received by a Tasmanian constituent in respect of matters to do with Tasmanian transport. I had undertaken to find out more about the circumstances in which the letter was sent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I can confirm that the mail-out was conducted in mid-April 1991 by the Department of Social Security (DSS) on behalf of the Tasmanian Department of Roads and Transport. Because the Department of Social Security was in fact doing the mail-out for the Tasmanian State Department, there was no positive identification of the material sent to the client by the Department and there was no information provided to the State Government. So, in that sense, no privacy rules were breached.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there was a failure by my Department to identify that it was the Department of Social Security that issued the material and that failure is contrary to departmental guidelines and practices in this area. The Department assures me that it has taken steps to strengthen and re-emphasise those guidelines to prevent a recurrence.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding the difficulties that were created for some clients in Tasmania in this case, it should be noted that the information was provided to enable clients to take advantage of a benefit which should have been available to them. The motives were correct. No information was disclosed to any party to whom it should not have been disclosed. But I regret that guidelines were not followed and that this situation was not made clear to those who received the letter.

         â€”Perhaps I could take a couple of seconds to read out a few paragraphs of what clients would normally be told. The following would be included in a letter to them:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Department of Social Security has been asked by the Action Group for Disabled Children Inc for assistance in conducting a survey relating to the service needs of families caring for children with disabilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department has agreed to cooperate because it is considered that the survey will be generally beneficial to . . . clients.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to assure you that the Department has not or will not release any information on departmental clients to the Action Group. The system adopted is that the Department of Social Security will forward a questionnaire and a covering letter from the Action Group to all recipients of Child Disability Allowance in Victoria. However it should be noted that the Department will not provide the Action Group with names of the people who received the questionnaires.
       </para>
       <para>
        On behalf of the Department of Social Security I also want to emphasize that no one is compelled to answer the questionnaire. It is entirely for you to decide whether you wish to complete and return the form to the Action Group. It should also be noted that you are not required to sign or in any other way identify yourself on the form unless you make that choice.
       </para>
       <para>
        That would have been signed by the State Director in Victoria. So that is the kind of warning, if one wants to call it that-or caution, in any event-that clients would be advised of in that circumstance.

        As part of the comprehensive evaluation of JET, information is needed on community and employer reactions to the program and the influence of various local factors on its success.

        Three organisations responded and their proposals were subjected to an evaluation, conducted in a similar way to a formal tender evaluation, by a joint committee with representatives of the Departments of Social Security, Finance, Community Services and Health, and Employment Education and Training. These Departments had also been involved in the choice of the organisations to be contacted initially. It was considered that the proposal from ACOSS best satisfied the criteria laid down for the evaluation. Their cost of $70,000 was not the lowest but was within $3,000 of the lowest bid and was judged to offer the best value for money. The contract with ACOSS is in the process of finalisation.

It is not the Department of Social Security which does the Forward Estimates for the numbers of unemployed; it is done by the Treasury. It is Treasury's parameters within which we work. There are then formulas, which have been agreed over time between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Finance, whereby our numbers increase commensurately to handle the extra numbers of unemployed. But we do not actually set those unemployment parameters; they are done by Treasury. Senator Patterson would have to take up with that Department the request for any information that she wants. I wish her the best of luck.

I should most probably have advised him of my intention to ask these questions prior to the consideration of this section of the Estimates, and I apologise to him for that. Although not mentioned in the explanatory notes for the Additional Estimates, it is reasonable to assume that the announcement in the first week of May that the deeming rate would drop to 8 per cent will cause increased expenditure by the Department of Social Security. Can the Minister tell me what administrative procedures have been followed to ensure that pensioners' entitlements are varied in accordance with the drop in the deeming rate?

We are asking pensioners to notify us of the pensioner accounts in which they have their money so that from then on we can deal with banks to determine the interest rates, and they will not have to worry about the other occasions because I said I would vary the rate twice a year. We timed the announcement with an impending issue of Age Pension News. I think I made the announcement on the Tuesday and most pensioners in Australia had Age Pension News, which went into quite some detail on the question, by the Friday. We tried to minimise the costs by timing the announcements to match. But I will have to get the costs for the honourable senator.

         â€”The Australian Bankers Association had a number of meetings with me on what was an appropriate rate, and a number of further meetings were held with officers from my Department. It was a matter of determining what would be the right rate. The Australian Bankers Association wanted us to adopt a formula. A number of formulas were presented to us by the Association as to what might be the right rate. At the time most of those worked out at about 7.5 per cent.

        However, I did not make the decision to drop it to 8 per cent on my own. I had a meeting with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and with their officials, and they were provided with details of the Australian Bankers Association request. My recommendation to them was not to agree to the formulas suggested by the Australian Bankers Association, on the basis that all of them involved regular-on some occasions, very regular-fluctuations. Given the difficulty in ever introducing a reform such as deeming, which I have always admitted would cause some consternation and confusion, much of which we have managed to settle down, if the rate were to vary every week, we would have no hope of explaining that to many pensioners. I thought it would be too complicated and too difficult.

        The other Ministers accepted my recommendation that we not agree to a formula but agreed that a rate of 8 per cent was a rate which could be held for some time as being, in any event, very near to that which was requested by the Bankers Association but also giving pensioners perhaps a very slight edge.

It does concern me that so soon after the introduction of deeming at 10 per cent we had to change to 8 per cent. I believe that it has caused consternation and difficulty with many pensioners, who have had to face some difficult changes. I gave the Minister credit when, on Friday night in Western Australia, I spoke about the introduction of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme charge. We have seen a reduction in the use of pharmaceutical benefits. Hopefully, that will continue for people who do not need medication as opposed to those who really need it.

        We were not opposed to the Minister bringing in the deeming but we did have some concerns about the rate, and I think that was justified. I do hope that the Minister and the Department will make every attempt to ensure that, when rates like this are set, a little more foresight is used and we see what is happening in the market. If that were the case, we may have been able to set 8 per cent in the beginning and not have this change so soon afterwards.

         â€”I did not know about last night's ruling; nor do I know whether there is a reservation here on deeming or not. I can give a very short answer to Senator Patterson. I absolutely disagree with her, although I am grateful that she gave me a run in Western Australia. The 10 per cent rate was set quite deliberately in line with markets at the time. The fact that it could be held from August right through to June, I think, is testimony to the fact that it was right at the time we announced it.

       <para>
        I was told by many on Senator Patterson's side of the chamber-although not by her-that pensioners would not be able to obtain 10 per cent at call. At the time of making the announcement to drop it to 8 per cent, there were 62 at call accounts around Australia. This is one occasion on which I can say, `I told you so: the 10 per cent rate was right'. We held on to it for a long time. I did not want to penalise the banks; that was never the intention. It was to get a fairer system and simply not to have them take advantage of pensioners. That being the case, 10 per cent could never be kept for ever. I said that it will be varied twice a year, which means every six months, not the 10 months that we held the last rate.

        Has any approach been made regarding the use of the DSS beneficiary number in relation to the Health Insurance Commission's planned computerised pharmaceutical eligibility checking procedure if a person does not have his or her Medicare number?

       <para>
        In the written answer of the Department, which I received on 28 May, the Department stated that the Department of Social Security beneficiary numbers are used now because they are included on pharmacists' claims which are cross-checked with DSS eligibility information held by the Health Insurance Commission. The answer from the Department continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Health Insurance Commission has approached the Department of Social Security about a new system of verification. Under the proposals the Social Security pensioner/beneficiary number would continue to be in the verification procedures.

        The ACOSS, the Brotherhood of Saint Laurence and Reark Research were the ones that responded.

In respect of the Young Homeless Allowance video, which we were discussing, the video is shown in DSS public contact areas. It is used as a community service announcement in non-metropolitan areas generally. It is also used in youth drop-in centres, refuges and the like.

As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, I was concerned to see that as a result of the new Antarctic Treaty that has been negotiated it is proposed to remove our Mawson huskies which have been in Antarctica for some 43 years. I know that this matter was raised in 1988. In fact, I have had correspondence from a concerned constituent here in Canberra who said that in 1988 a group of misinformed trendies proposed the removal of Mawson huskies for the same reasons that are proposed now.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The reasons given for the removal of the huskies is that they could create disease threats to animals in Antarctica and also environmental threats. My constituent points out that the Mawson huskies have been disease free for 43 years and have been isolated in the Antarctic environment, so it is impossible for them to introduce diseases. I just wonder whether any further consideration has been given to retaining our historic huskies there because they have been responsible in the past for saving lives, as was pointed out in this particular letter. I wonder whether the Minister has any more information at this stage.

If Senator Calvert is talking about the introduction of new dogs-and, essentially, I think we are talking about the necessity of their being introduced to keep up the breeding stock-it would be necessary to introduce a new strain roughly every five years to prevent inbreeding.

        However, that is not the major concern. The major concern is that, if treaty nations set an example by maintaining introduced species such as dogs, it is more difficult to prevent private expeditions using dogs which could introduce disease to the wildlife of Antarctica. Of course, private expeditions from quite a number of places are visiting the Antarctic much often than was the case in the past.

I ask the Minister whether, in the last 43 years, there have been other dogs introduced into Antarctica from outside to increase or improve the strain.

         â€”I only have one other matter I wish to raise and that concerns a question that Senator Baume put on notice and the answer regarding the hire rates for the Aurora Australis. The answer to the question was that the Antarctic shipping charters normally provide for annual increases and the charter for the Aurora Australis provides for an annual increase in the hire rate linked to movement in the consumer price index. I wonder whether the arrangement that was arrived at with P and O, which Senator Richardson negotiated, included the wages for the crew.

But P and O will have talks with the Seamen's Union, work out how far it thought it ought to go in coming to some terms with the union and, at that point, it will then consult the Department. Quite obviously, that point has not been reached because the Department informs me that it has not been consulted on this matter. So those talks with P and O are not even at the stage where P and O wants to talk to the Department about them.

         â€”I would like to start off by dealing with some questions relating to the arts. Firstly, I refer to the response to questions I asked about film and television in program 6 of the explanatory notes. Senator Aulich asked how the film Green Card scored on the co-production criteria. As I understand it, there has not been a response to that question. I raise that in relation to responses to several questions, including one that I asked, about the definition of an Australian film for these purposes: firstly, of film financing and, secondly, for the showing of Australian films on television to be regarded as Australian content. The definitions seems to be so vague-so chaotic, in fact-that a film can be an Australian film for funding purposes but not for television purposes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There has been a disagreement between two governmental bodies on this score, and it seems to me that this is totally unsatisfactory, particularly when we find that there is no clear-cut formula under the financing arrangements for what is an Australian film. I asked in the Senate Estimates Committee:
       </para>
       <para>
        Just to get it clear, for a film to be an Australian film for financing purposes, I understand the major proportion of the components, that is, cinematography, editing, acting and so on, have got to be Australian. Is there a simple formula?
       </para>
       <para>
        The response was no. Then the discussion went on at some length on how and why there is not a simple formula. It is said that there are some requirements under the Income Tax Assessment Act relating to the determination of Australian content. One of the requirements, by the way, is that the subject matter of the film or the proposed film should be taken into account. Naturally, I think we can all establish that Green Card, which is an excellent film and which has done very well, did not meet that requirement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, there is a very subjective assessment here about what is an Australian film for financing purposes and a totally different set of assessments about what is an Australian film for television broadcasting purposes. The significant consequence of this is that it is more worthwhile to an Australian television broadcaster to purchase rights to an Australian film which fills up the quota for Australian content than it is to buy a film such as Green Card which, while Australian for financing purposes, is not Australian for television purposes. That disadvantages a film such as Green Card, if it is in fact an Australian film, and it has been given that category for financing purposes. All I am asking is that the Government kindly get its act together. Will it work out what is an Australian film and what is not? If two different Australian governmental bodies cannot agree, perhaps their heads can be banged together so that people know where they stand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that, when the Australian Film Corporation made a submission to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on this matter, it was told to go away and that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was going to take its own view. I understand that this matter has still not been resolved, that further submissions are being made. I regard Green Card as an excellent film, and I am overjoyed that so many elements of the Australian film industry participated in it, although, as I understand it, they were not actors. I ask what criteria the Minister is required to use under section 124ZAA, which says that, where the Minister is satisfied that a proposed film when completed will have a significant non-Australian content, or a film has a significant non-Australian content, the Minister may treat the proposed film or film as not being a qualifying Australian film for the purposes of the relevant division of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The film industry is entitled to be told what the real rules are. It is argued, for example, by Actors Equity that a film that does not have Australian actors in fact has a significant non-Australian content. Is the Government applying its mind to this matter? What are the rules and what is the Government going to do about it?

         â€”Senator Michael Baume has asked quite a number of questions. I will endeavour to go through them. Firstly, Senator Baume referred to a question asked by Senator Aulich, which in fact has been answered. But it was answered on the basis that Senator Aulich accepted that at least part of the answer was commercial-in-confidence because it related to certain financial details which no-one involved would want to make public. I am sure that Senator Baume could be provided with the same answer on the same basis. I am sure that the Department will contact Senator Baume after the proceedings have finished here on this matter. If he accepts that part of it is confidential, he will be provided with the answer.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I can make at least part of the answer that was given to Senator Aulich available now because it does not involve anything secretive and I think it goes to part of the question that Senator Baume was asking about. I should first say that Senator Aulich was provided with documents on co-productions. He got application guidelines, the United Kingdom treaty and the Canadian treaty and a memorandum of understanding with both France and New Zealand. I will read two paragraphs of this answer because it is of assistance:
       </para>
       <para>
        Key creative participation in co-productions is assessed under a 12 point system where a production is mounted under the terms of the co-production treaty and a 10 point system when a less than treaty status agreement applies, as is the case between Australia and France.
       </para>
       <para>
        Green Card scored sufficient points for that less than treaty co-production point system and it did so because of the participation of Australians in the roles of writer, director, director of photography, editor and designer. That is how it was done. As to the details which Senator Aulich had requested on the financial structure, they must remain commercial-in-confidence, for quite obvious reasons. If Senator Baume agrees to that arrangement, then there is no difficulty in providing him with those.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Baume also referred to the fact that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has different standards from the co-production standards that we were just talking about and he is, of course, correct. As I understand it, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is currently holding an inquiry into these co-productions. The Department has made a submission to that inquiry. It is to be hoped that at the end of this inquiry we will not have to bang any heads together and that some reasonable agreement will be reached. On the basis of what discussion in the Estimates Committee and in the present debate has been thrown up, I give an undertaking that I will raise this matter with the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Simmons, and also with the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, to make sure they understand what priority must be placed on standardising the requirements. Senator Baume is quite right; they are anomalous and they ought to be fixed. I have a document here which explains the points system and I am happy to table that document.

         â€”I thank the Minister for that and I would be grateful if I could have a copy of the document. I am grateful that the Minister will encourage his fellow Ministers to examine this clear anomaly. I am worried also about the lack of a clear formula, as I mentioned in the determination of the Australian content. My concern relates to vague words such as `a proposed film has a significant non-Australian content'. I mentioned this matter earlier. I understand that Actors Equity says that, because there are no Australian actors at all in Green Card, by clear definition that film has a significant non-Australian content. Quite frankly, I hope those words do not mean what they say, because I would like films such as Green Card to be capable of being made and to see Australian entrepreneurs in the film industry and other skilled people getting an opportunity to become involved in the world film market. Actors are not the only people involved in the film industry. They are very important and they give an Australian look to many movies, but there is also a self-evident Australian cinematographic look which is being widely accepted and welcomed throughout the world, as can be seen from the use of leading Australian cinematographers in films such as Dances with Wolves, which is otherwise not an Australian movie.

Quite a number of criteria are set down and that is what the Minister has to balance any decision against. However, I will not pretend that this is an area which does not require clarification. That being the case, as I understand it, the Department is looking at doing that as we speak. Whilst an announcement will not be made tonight, I am hopeful that the Minister can make an announcement on the question shortly.

         â€”I thank the Minister for Social Security once again for a very helpful and useful response. I now want to ask a question about the National Film and Sound Archive. I was advised during the Senate Estimates that I would be told-and I was told in a subsequent written response-about the limited access which is now available to people who wish to use the services of the Film and Sound Archive because of the desperate state of some of the other projects: for example, resources have been redirected towards the preservation of nitrate film.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As it is evident that the present target for restoring this film will not be met by the time the present special arrangements expire-and there is a program dealing with a great deal of uncopied nitrate film-this project will have to continue beyond that time and, hopefully, the nitrate film will survive until that time. I wonder whether, in diverting these resources to this urgent matter, it means that this very limited access to the services of the Film and Sound Archive will continue for what looks to be several years until this emergency is overcome. The extent of the withdrawal of services by, and access to, the National Film and Sound Archive is very substantial. For example, the response states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Research and Information: services are withdrawn . . . clients visiting the Canberra office will be free to conduct their own research. Information requests requiring research will not be accepted.

I understand the need for a priority in directing all of the funds to salvaging the material that is deteriorating at a disastrous rate-particularly when we recognise that even when this has been done there will be some nitrate stock left over which will not have been treated and saved by the time the present program expires. Firstly, what can be done to ensure that that nitrate stock is not lost? Secondly, when will access to normal services, which I think the community is entitled to expect from the National Film and Sound Archive, be resumed?

         â€”The answer to Senator Michael Baume's last question is two years. The reason for that length of time does not involve simply these questions of nitrate film and colour film difficulties that have been caused by the temperature at which some of these films have been stored. Rather, this has been brought about by the problem that masses of material have been received over time which have never been examined properly. The truth is that we do not really know what we have.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In times of budgetary constraint, it is not always possible to allocate sufficient sums of money to every worthwhile cause. The Minister has instructed the National Film and Sound Archive to give this task of cataloguing-if that is the right word-all of this material a big priority. That does not mean that work on the nitrate problem stops; in fact, it will continue. But if the National Film and Sound Archive were to attempt to provide all of the services it provided formerly, then this cataloguing work would never be done. So priorities have been redirected. It is unfortunate that there is not more money to go around but, as Senator Michael Baume would be aware, there is not an unlimited supply of money available in government at the moment. So the only way that the task could be completed within existing resources would be to withdraw some activities, and they are the activities which the honourable senator has stated correctly. Hopefully, in two years-or even less if the program went well-those services could be reinstated.

         â€”I thank the Minister once again for his helpful advice. In view of his answer, I now feel a little churlish in having to ask a fairly unpleasant question. At the Senate Estimates I asked about the base evaluation of material contained in the National Museum of Australia and also about the cost of restoring Australia II. A deal was done involving its purchase. I understand payment for it, at least in part-I think in large part-was made before the Government actually took possession of Australia II. It was established in the Senate Estimates that about $50,000 was required to refurbish Australia II to display standard. I am not criticising the fact that Australia II was, after its purchase, left in the possession of Mr Bond so that he could use it, I think, as a trial horse against the next yacht. But I wonder why $2m was paid for Australia II before the Government took possession, or was even required to take possession, of it. Were there other bidders in the market? Was Australia II such a hot property that we had to pay for it before we got it?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am interested in the speed at which the Government rushed into this purchase. I am not suggesting that in 1984 Mr Bond was in a financial situation where it was necessary to help out a mate. I think at that stage he still looked as though he had more black than red in his bank account. But why was $2m paid so enthusiastically? Who ordered the purchase? As I understand it, the National Museum did not, because it had no capacity to display it. In fact, it is to be displayed by the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney, to whom it has been lent for some years. The National Maritime Museum in fact has a special large area in which to accommodate Australia II and its tall mast.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am interested to know who ordered the purchase. It has been suggested to me that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did, or at least he was strongly in favour of it and that view was conveyed. In these circumstances it is reasonable to ask whether the Museum Board and/or the Chief Executive of the National Museum opposed the purchase. Did it involve the diversion of funds that the National Museum might like to expend elsewhere on this very significant piece of Australia's heritage?

         â€”The Department has advised me that it will try to check some extra details on this now, as we continue to speak. Perhaps I can get an answer before we report progress. As a general point, the museum has purchased a lot of material that it has never been able to display; that is not unusual. There is a warehouse full of it in Canberra. Obviously Australia II would be much more difficult to put in a warehouse than a lot of other items; it would require a pretty big warehouse. I can understand why some different arrangement might have been made. I do not know whether the Board recommended the purchase or whether the Government recommended the purchase to the Board. We will try to get an answer for Senator Baume. As far as the owner was concerned, I do not think that in 1984 he looked like he needed much help; I think he was travelling pretty well then.

        I do not presume that I was the first person to point out to the museum and the Department that the museum, during the time of its existence, had not been doing what it was required to do. Why has it taken it six or seven years to grapple with this problem and not come up with a solution yet? I presume that a museum knows the value of its items. If something like Australia II is bought for $2m, one would think that it would be in the books either for $2m or some written down value. I understand that many items in the museum have been donated and that it is difficult to put a value on them. Some items that are donated are given an estimated value for tax purposes so that the donor gets a benefit. Presumably they would have a value. I wonder why these valuations are not available.

         â€”I now want to deal with a problem which is referred to in the report of Estimates Committee C relating to unnecessary allocations made in the Estimates for funds which will not be required. The report of Estimates Committee C to the Senate says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Committee heard with concern admissions from the Department about requests for allocations that were not capable of being spent.

        These included an allocation for the salary of a new position, that of the Chief Science Adviser, and the funding to cover a projected shortfall in revenue from entrance fees to Kakadu National Park. This concerned me as a matter of principle. In at least one of those instances it was evident, long before the Forward Estimates would have become an excited glow in someone's eyes, that that sort of funding would not be met.

       <para>
        Is there any process in the Department at senior levels which would ensure that the branches that proceed with this kind of bolstering of its estimates figures are stopped from doing so? One always has a suspicion that, when organisations bolster their cash requirements in excess of what they can possibly spend, there may be some hope in their hearts that they can divert that money into other purposes-that as it will inevitably remain unspent at the end of the year it can be switched within some broad parameters into some area where the organisation is a bit short of money. Firstly, I would like an assurance that this sort of thing cannot happen and, secondly, that the Department would be alert to these kinds of nonsensical estimates which patently and inevitably cannot be spent.

         â€”Or damage, yes. Ministers are required under section 30 to convince themselves that there is no alternative, that their actions are reasonable, et cetera. I am particularly concerned now that in response to my questions I have received a note from Mr Blunn, the Secretary of the Department-and I thank him for it-explaining to me what is a difficult legal matter, that is, a judgment in a recent court action relating to Paddy's Market. I understand that it is not a legal explanation. It is a layman's explanation to me as a layman and that is why I am grateful that he sent it to me.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The essence of his letter seems to be that notwithstanding a decision by Justice Wilcox, the Full Court's reversal of Justice Wilcox's judgment seems to suggest that the requirements of the heritage Act become irrelevant if in fact a decision by a governmental body like the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) relates to the actions of private individuals. In other words, the Foreign Investment Review Board can quite happily make a decision-and I remind the Senate that the FIRB is under the control of the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-which would result in the destruction or damage of a heritage object without in fact being covered by section 30. That is the clear implication of this.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the Government, in this case, does not have to be bound by its own law. There is no requirement in this case on the Treasurer, who is the responsible Minister, to establish that there is no proper viable alternative to the action. Ultimately, the agent in the destruction of Paddy's Market was not to be the Government itself but someone to whom the Government gave approval. This seems to me to be extraordinarily quaint, to say the least. In other words, the Government itself would not be allowed to pull down Paddy's Market and redevelop it unless it met the requirements of section 30 of the heritage Act, but the Government could quite happily give a permit to someone else to do so. It seems to me that if this is so, the heritage Act ought to be changed. The FIRB ought to be bound by this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason that I say that this clearly emerges from the decision is evident from the letter that I received from the Secretary of the Department. According to that letter, the Full Court:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . ruled that Yates Security Services did not have standing to bring the case-
       </para>
       <para>
        and this is the important part-
       </para>
       <para>
        that the Treasurer's approval of the foreign investment purchase of Paddy's Markets was not invalid as the approval of foreign investment in this case was not a matter which required the application of Section 30 of the AHC Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The letter also said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth decision maker must be positively satisfied of the non-existence of `feasible and prudent alternatives' . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet, here we have a situation where one of the judges said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think it can be said that the Treasurer's approval of the acquisition of the lease was, of its nature, a granting of a consent to proceed with the development.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the development could not proceed in respect of these people without the Treasurer's consent but an Australian could have proceeded to pull down Paddy's Market.
       </para>
       <para>
        This very quaint dividing line means that there is probably a greater prospect of a foreign developer with a lot of financial backing being able to move in and redevelop a site of some heritage significance which an Australian corporation may well not have the resources to do. Here we have a situation where approval is required from the Commonwealth before an Australian heritage item is destroyed. Yet, because the Commonwealth itself is not destroying it, the Commonwealth is not bound by the Heritage Commission Act. If it is not bound, I think it ought to do something about binding itself. The letter goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, while the approval of the Treasurer placed Rockvale in a position where it could proceed to obtain all necessary approvals for the development, it did not in itself determine the question of whether the Paddy's site would have development or not; that decision was in the hands of the Darling Harbour Authority, and the development may have proceeded (with another, non-foreign investment developer) even if foreign investment approval had been refused. Hence, the Treasurer's decision did not, in the opinion of the Court, constitute an action which in itself adversely affected the national estate values of Paddy's Market.
       </para>
       <para>
        It just resulted in the market being pulled down or facaded. Really, I am wondering what the Government's intention is in this matter. As Mr Justice Pincus said in his determination:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . (Section 30) is essentially a prescription of administrative procedures to be observed within government and imposes no obligation upon citizens, who might be adversely affected by invalidation.
       </para>
       <para>
        This raises the next very serious question: to what extent then are government business enterprises which are dealing with the public bound by section 30? In general, to what extent is the Government considering fixing up the heritage Act so that the Government cannot in fact make decisions which facilitate-and this is the key point-the destruction of or damage to Australian heritage?

         â€”The Shark Bay situation involves cooperation with Western Australia in a proposed agreement with that State and requires the Western Australian Government to pass complementary legislation. In the Senate Estimates hearing we discovered that the funding requested in the Forward Estimates was not likely to be spent because the Western Australian Government had not passed any complementary legislation to establish appropriate management arrangements, and it seemed a long way from doing so. I wonder to what extent has the Western Australian Government's view that there is a distortion of the State Budget involvement been resolved? Will there be agreement within the near future between the Western Australian Labor Government and the Federal Labor Government over this matter which clearly is of considerable significance?

         â€”I would now like to deal with some matters affecting sport. I thought that one of my colleagues would be asking questions about the arts in Queensland but apparently he has not made it. I know that Senator Crichton-Browne will be keen to pursue some of these as well.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The first matter I want to raise relates to the way in which the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), by charging fees for the televising of sporting events, is diverting, from many sports, Australian Sports Commission funding. In many instances these charges are imposed because the ABC has a captive market.
       </para>
       <para>
        To be able to run international events, such as the World Netball Championships or the World Rowing Championships, Australian sporting organisations are required to have television coverage provided. The ABC has taken the view that, in those situations, if it is to provide television coverage it wants the sporting body to provide the cash. As a result of that, quite frankly, the ABC appears to have stood over quite a few sports.
       </para>
       <para>
        We see a situation where, for the up coming World Netball Championships in Australia, there has been a $200,000 grant from the Government towards those championships, of which 40 per cent, or $80,000, is going to the ABC to help pay the ABC's cost of televising that event. When the World Rowing Championships were held in Tasmania, of the $250,000 Australian Sports Commission grant, $150,000 went to the ABC. For the World Swimming Championships in Perth, a government grant of $500,000 was obtained to help stage that event, of which $150,000 went to the ABC.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned about that. If the ABC takes the view that it gets no net benefit in terms of viewers, I suppose that is a commercial judgment that it is making. But it intrigues me that the ABC pays multi millions of taxpayers' money to other professional sporting organisations to get the right to televise their sporting events, and bids heavily against commercial channels to cover events such as tonight's venture, in which New South Wales will no doubt beat Queensland. The Minister rolls his eyes and, as he is a good numbers man, that worries me.

         â€”The Minister was not the only person who lost money last time. It is a matter of concern to me that the ABC is paying large amounts of money to professional sports to televise their events, yet charging large amounts of money to amateur sporting organisations to televise those events.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Maybe the ABC could be asked to provide us with some sort of cost-benefit analysis as to whether it receives any other benefits. What sorts of ratings does it get for coverage of athletics, rowing and so on? I just do not know. The ABC seems to be taking a pretty tough approach. As a result of this activity, many amateur sports are coming under very heavy financial pressure. Many of them have approached sponsors for funding. I commend them for doing so. Quite frankly, it diminishes the burden on taxpayers to assist sports if individual sporting organisations can get out and get corporate sponsorship. I commend them for doing so.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, women's cricket got one of the oil companies to sponsor it. I commend the oil company for doing so. I wish I could remember its name so I could give it a free plug here now. I think it was Shell-yes, a head is nodding. Women's netball obtained support from another oil company, which I think was Mobil. I am at least getting the good oil on this occasion. I commend these bodies for doing so.
       </para>
       <para>
        But now, these sporting bodies having obtained this sort of sponsorship, the ABC, which is forcing them and press-ganging them into paying for their television coverage, will not allow the sponsors' names to appear on television. A month or so ago the ABC board determined that sponsorships would not be acknowledged on the ABC.

         â€”I do not know whose particular political philosophy it was. All I know is that in pragmatic terms it is grossly unfair. It is to the disadvantage of Australian sport, and I hope that the ABC will recognise the error of its ways. This was a decision taken on a philosophic basis and not on a practical basis. It reveals an inability to distinguish between sponsorship of a program which the ABC does not want to get involved in-and that is up to the ABC; that is fair enough-and the covering of an event that has been sponsored. The ABC is not being subsidised when it covers an event that is sponsored by a private body. For example, in the case of the Winfield Cup the ABC spends money seeking to televise a sponsored event.

        Here we have amateur sport suffering as a result of an ideological and nonsensical decision by the ABC. Even though the ABC, of course, must remain independent, I hope that the Government will be taking the view that the consequences of this decision-and, one would hope, the unintended consequences of the decision-can be conveyed to the ABC from within the Government. But in the replies that I have had to questions since the Estimates hearings finished, we find out that the Australian Sports Commission understands that some sporting organisations have lost sponsorships because of the ABC's decision. These organisations will not have the benefit of that support.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, it may well be that the taxpayers of Australia have to pick up the tab to assist some amateur sports because of the way they are being deprived of sponsorship funding. For example, the Australian Rugby Football Union lost an existing major sponsor because of the ABC's recently implemented policy on the naming of sponsors. The Commission has told me it is aware that Athletics Australia was unable to meet the ABC production charges to telecast the 1991 Australian track and field championships held in Sydney in February. In other words, we are having situations where national sporting events which attract the interests of Australian sports people are not being televised because the ABC is making unreasonable demands on the Australian sporting bodies involved.

I hope that as a result of this debate tonight the ABC will advise us on how it comes to this decision to act in such an unfair and improper way with Australian amateur sport.

        </para>

       <para>
        The Sports Commission also understands that the Amateur Boxing Union of Australia was considering approaching the ABC to seek televised coverage of certain events but has not proceeded due to the ABC's policy of charging production costs to the sport. In the past-that is, prior to the implementation of the ABC's charging policy-the ABC provided live coverage of Australian track and field championships. The Sports Commission has advised me that track and field events were not covered by the ABC because Athletics Australia determined that it could not afford the ABC production costs. Instead, Athletics Australia decided to direct its sponsorship dollars, which came from the Australian sugar industry-and if the ABC will not acknowledge it, I will-to the conduct of the event and to the athletes. In other words, money that would normally go to the athletes in the conducting of events, facilities and so on is now-in those situations where the events still proceed to be televised-being milked off by the ABC.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am particularly concerned in those situations where Australian amateur sporting organisations will not be granted the conduct of games or world championships in Australia unless television coverage is there. We are finding that the ABC, the national television network which many of us had thought was outstanding in the field of sports cover, is now looking more to the sports to cover the costs no matter, it appears, what the viewing audience is like. Would it not be ludicrous if the ABC got very high ratings for a program, having forced the sport itself to provide the costs for that program?

Very often the sports earn a considerable amount. Clearly, if any sporting event-national, international or whatever-is going to arouse the interest of a great many Australians, it will not be the case that the ABC has to charge for the production costs. There will be significant competition from the networks to show whatever event it is so that they can make some money out of it. What so often happens is that the job falls onto the ABC of providing coverage of events which have great significance to a particular sport, but perhaps not so much outside of it, and therefore are not big in the ratings game. In those situations, the ABC will always be caught between two stools: between attempting to do better in the ratings and hence justify-in at least the minds of some but not necessarily in mine-the extensive amounts of Government funding that it receives--

         â€”This evening I wish to put on record a brief summary of the life and work of Sister Irene McCormack, the Josephite nun who was so brutally and senselessly killed in Peru last week. By this event, the sheep and wheat district of Trayning in the central wheat belt of Western Australia, where Sister Irene was born, has now been linked forever with the seed potato producers of Hausa Huasi in Peru.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Sister Irene was born on 28 August 1938 at Kununoppin Hospital, the daughter of Mary O'Meara and Thomas McCormack. I have had the pleasure to know her older brother since school days. I met Sister Irene when she had been a Josephite for quite a long time. She spent her early days and her early education at Trayning, one of the three sister towns of Trayning, Kununoppin and Yelbeni-hence the KTY local number plate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Her first contact with the Josephite order was at the Trayning convent. The Josephites had, and still have, a scattering of catholic schools around my State of Western Australia. I am proud to say that I started my education in one of those schools. Sister Irene attended Santa Maria College in Perth for two years and then returned to the farm for one year because her mother thought she was too young to enter a convent. It was at this time that she developed her debating skills with the local junior farmer group, where many learnt debating, including at least three that I know of in this place today.
       </para>
       <para>
        She also developed her golf and tennis skills, enjoyed the weekly country dance, and during that period took a great interest in Australian rules football, becoming a South Fremantle supporter. She entered the Josephites in 1955, being the only young woman from Western Australia to seek admission that year. She was professed on 6 January 1959 after two years as a novitiate at Baulkham Hills in Sydney, and made her final vows in January 1965.
       </para>
       <para>
        After spending time at south Perth, she then taught in schools in Kalgoorlie, Boulder, Busselton, New Norcia and Mundaring, and completed her teaching career by spending seven years in the tall timber town of Manjimup. It was at this time that she decided to do something for the Third World countries: she spent one year preparing herself with the Columbans in Sydney. The last time I remember seeing Sister Irene was at a junior farmer re- union-the junior farmer group is now somewhat in recession-held in Perth in early 1986, which she attended with her brother Gerald.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was amazed that, after 30 years in the sisterhood, she was so much the life of the party and had not lost her obvious love of dancing. Her companions in religion farewelled her a few months after that function to the newly founded Josephite Mission in Peru. The rest is now history. Her work and demise in that country have been well documented in other places. It is interesting to note from a report that the people of Hausa Huasi refused to let her body leave the place and wanted her buried there.
       </para>
       <para>
        Her wishes must have been well known because her funeral was bedecked with red and white streamers and flowers-the colours of her beloved South Fremantle but, at a deeper symbolic level, the colours of innocence and martyrdom. In their sadness, the family could be excused for bitterness, but it is interesting to record a passage from her brother's speech at her memorial service, held in South Perth, when he said, `We'-the family- `do not bear any grudges against the perpetrators'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude with the words of Sister Maria Casey, RSJ, head of the order in Western Australia, in her communication with me when I asked for Sister Irene's curriculum vitae. She stated:

         â€”Tonight I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the National Union of Students has declared tomorrow as a national day of action in support of Austudy reforms. Tertiary students at most campuses in Australia have organised rallies and activities such as forums, soup kitchens, free lunches, marches and letter writing projects in support of the day of action. Also, Federal politicians will be receiving telephone calls and faxes throughout the day.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The National Union of Students represents over 300,000 students. Tomorrow's protest is part of a major campaign leading up to this year's Federal Budget. The purpose of this action is to highlight student poverty because of major inequities in the current Austudy scheme. The theme of the national campaign is, very aptly, `You can't feed a dog on Austudy'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Too many students are excluded unfairly from receiving any Austudy benefits at all because of this scheme's draconian regulations. Students who do receive Austudy are struggling to survive on the allowances which they receive because those allowances are well below the poverty line. At the moment, only 42 per cent of tertiary students receive Austudy. Of those, less than half-in fact, 46.5 per cent-receive the full amount.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has called Austudy a targeting of those who most deserve to receive Austudy. I suggest that this targeting is quite apt. In fact, it does not miss at all. It hits square on and sends those who are hit straight into poverty. When one has been declared eligible for Austudy and is able to receive it, it really should not be a reason for celebration. The very definition of being eligible for Austudy almost defines a young person as being poor and having very few options available.
       </para>
       <para>
        A recent survey of students at the Adelaide University showed that most students in receipt of Austudy are living in poverty. About 80 per cent had an income below $10,000 per year, and 23 per cent received only $4,000 per year. The Price report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training suggested that about $12,000 was needed just to cover a student's living costs. In real terms, many students are flat broke; they are starving and increasingly in debt. Some students have been forced to drop out of their studies and others, who are desperate to keep studying, have resorted to crime in its various forms, including prostitution, as reported in several of the daily metropolitan newspapers.
       </para>
       <para>
        If students manage to find legitimate part time work, they can only earn about one-third of the average income. The Price report, to which I referred earlier, found that, when normal tax is taken into account, students who earn over the current Austudy limit of $4,000 are taxed effectively at the incredible rate of 75 per cent. A story in the Australian on 22 May 1991 was headed `Austudy and Starve or Drop out on the Dole'. That headline is no exaggeration whatsoever. It really is absurd that students who are ineligible for Austudy, and even those who receive it, are better off financially if they drop out and join the dole queues.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article in the Australian cites one case where an Adelaide university student received a matriculation score of 450 and is studying to achieve her ambition to become a lawyer. However, because of the difficulties of living on Austudy-she receives $115 a week-she is thinking of dropping out. The student, 18-year-old Samantha Maiden, is quoted as saying that having no money all the time means `you lose your incentive to sit down and study because your life is so full of other problems'. This is a young person who has that score and should be studying for law. She says:
       </para>
       <para>
        It sounds melodramatic, but sometimes you really have to ask yourself, `Do I go and buy this book or do I go and buy some food?' You can't be expected to study when you are totally strung out.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition and the Government recently rejected moves by the Australian Democrats to achieve some urgently needed reforms to Austudy. These included a reduction in the age of independence from 25 to 18 years; a return to the pre-Budget threshold for spouse income, which should be indexed to $19,300, instead of the post-Budget figure of $12,150; and an increase in the personal income threshold.
       </para>
       <para>
        The demands of the National Union of Students reflect the same concerns and we hope that the Government will take the necessary action to improve the prospects of students who are truly suffering. For tomorrow, the Australian Democrats support the students in their actions and wish them well.

         â€”The tragedy involving a Lauda Air aircraft in Thailand on Monday and three Australians-and I extend our sympathy to the families of those people-highlights all too clearly the changed circumstances in which we all live and the risks that we all take in travelling. All too often we think that those sorts of incidents are foreign to Australia; that such a thing could never happen. We might once have thought we were immune to the violence that so often is part and parcel of life in other countries, but in recent years a number of incidents have caused us to realise that it could happen here.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Against that background, we must also realise that our major airport, Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport-handling 200,000 aircraft movements a year, 13 million passengers and 160,000 tonnes of freight-is sadly and dangerously overtaxed. That situation, we are told constantly, is not likely to improve and, indeed, by the year 2005 global air traffic will double and by the year 2010 it will treble. We cannot afford to be lax about the safety of aircraft and the safety of passengers either in the air or on the ground. If we keep delaying making a decision about a third runway and a second airport, that is what we will be doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we continue to pour people in aircraft onto overcrowded runways and if we continue to pour people into inadequate terminals, we will increase the chances of security becoming lax and accidents in the air. We cannot afford to be complacent-not about security, not about safety-and the recent tragedy in Thailand ought to remind us that Australia is a popular tourist destination, just as Thailand is, and the apparent sabotage in Thailand could conceivably occur again. Let us hope that Australia's airport security continues to remain at its present high standard. We can only ensure that will be the case if we continue to develop our airport systems and keep Australian aviation at the forefront of safety.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) There are two principal factors which point to a significant upturn in the world uranium market from about the middle of the 1990s. One is the increasing gap between production and estimated demand, which will require additional sources of supply in that period. The other is the large volume of demand for which no contracts have yet been negotiated, which will provide competitive suppliers with further market opportunities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Supply and Demand
      </para>
      <para>
       Nuclear generating capacity will increase between now and the year 2000. Outside the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, nuclear generating capacity is currently about 280 GWe. Forecasts for 2000 range from Greenpeace's estimate of 310 GWe to industry estimates, based on utility plans, of between 323 GWe and 330 GWe. Estimates made by my department suggest that 320 GWe is a realistic expectation.
      </para>
      <para>
       These figures translate into estimates of uranium demand. Uranium demand is currently estimated to be about 46,000 tonnes U. For the year 2000, assuming a generating capacity of 320 GWe, such an estimate, taking technical factors into consideration in a commercially realistic way, would be 51,000-54,000 tonnes U.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the supply side, the uranium market is currently undergoing substantial adjustment. In every year since 1985, uranium production has been less than reactor related requirements. For 1989, production was 34,000 tonnes U. For 1990, preliminary estimates are that production was below 30,000 tonnes U. The gap between production and requirements is being met from stocks, which, it would seem, are being drawn down at a faster rate than previously envisaged, and, to a lesser extent, from new sources of supply, such as the Soviet Union. At the current rate at which inventories are being drawn down, they are expected to reach levels, at which utilities would wish to maintain them, within a few years. Soviet penetration of the market, although likely to be significant, will be restrained by both Soviet market strategies and customer perceptions about long-term reliability.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although it is always difficult to pinpoint when a market will return to equilibrium, the above factors point to the need for a substantial increase in future production, as inventories are drawn down and the existing gap between production and demand widens. This requirement for additional production is expected to occur in the mid 1990s.
      </para>
      <para>
       Uncommitted Demand
      </para>
      <para>
       The amount of demand not yet under supply contracts-uncommitted demand-constitutes a substantial proportion of the total demand estimate. For 1995, it is about 18,000 tonnes U and, for 2000, about 38,000 tonnes U. The cumulative amount of uncommitted demand over the period 1995-2000 is estimated to be about 160,000 tonnes U.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given the degree of market adjustment referred to above, which has involved the closure of many high cost production centres, the amount of uncommitted demand further illustrates the extent of market opportunities for competitive suppliers, such as Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Neither the 1989 OECD Red Book nor its 1990 Statistical Update predicts that uranium supply will be 49,000 tonnes U in 1995.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Red Book assesses production capabilities and, for 1995, estimates that production capability, including from prospective mine centres, will be about 49,000 tonnes U. The Red Book is explicit in drawing a distinction between production capability and actual production. It points out that actual production is expected to remain below reactor requirements until desired levels of stocks are reached.
      </para>
      <para>
       For 1990, the Red Book estimated that annual production capability could range from 43,000 to 50,000 tonnes U. As noted above, preliminary estimates are that actual production in 1990 was less than 30,000 tonnes U. Differences of this magnitude underline the fact that production capability is not equivalent to, or even a rough measure of, actual production.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) On 1 January 1988 the Australian crude oil market was deregulated and since then the Government has had no involvement in the negotiation process for the sale of oil. Consequently, the price which Australian companies receive for the crude oil that they sell to Australian firms or export to overseas markets is determined solely by commercial negotiation between the parties to the transaction.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) OPEC is a cartel of oil producing nations, which accounts for about 37 per cent of the world's oil production. The degree of control over the international price of crude oil exercised by OPEC members depends largely upon the discipline of OPEC members in producing within the quotas agreed. In the past their ability to do so has varied widely. On 11-12 March 1991 OPEC members agreed to an informal package of production cuts aimed at achieving the OPEC reference price of $US21 a barrel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The price which oil producing countries receive for their oil is determined by commercial negotiation with purchasing firms and organisations. The price received is influenced by a range of factors including: the balance between supply and demand; the type of oil being sold, ie whether it is a light or a heavy crude; whether the oil is being sold under a long or short term contract; and the timing of sales, ie whether the oil is being sold on the spot market or sold for future delivery. At present the prices of the international marker crudes Oman, West Texas Intermediate and Brent are around $US20-21 a barrel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The price that Australian producers receive for crude oil is also determined by commercial negotiation and reflects international prices. Wholesale petrol prices peaked around October last year and have since declined significantly. In fact, the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) announced on 10 April 1991 that maximum wholesale prices, excluding recent excise and State franchise fee increases, had fallen below the level prevailing at the time of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In general, retail prices have followed the downward trend in wholesale prices of petrol as determined by the PSA. Retail prices will also fluctuate with discounting and competition in the market. The PSA reported on 3 May that retail prices in most capital cities have recently dipped below 60 cents per litre for the first time since hostilities broke out in the Gulf in August 1990.

      <para>
       (1) In answer to a question without notice (Senate Hansard, 22 January 1991, p. 141) it was indicated that 23 expressions of interest from various companies had been lodged with the Space Office in relation to the Cape York Space Port development;

        â€”The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (2) The 23 companies which registered interest with the Space Office did so on a commercially confidential basis. It would therefore be inappropriate to release their names without their consent. It should be noted however that it is open to any of these 23 companies to approach any of the other companies which have made public their interest and intentions regarding the development of a spaceport.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. AIDC Ltd has held preliminary discussions with the majority of registrants in order to establish the level of their interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The spaceport project remains a commercial activity which will be required to proceed without Government investment or subsidy. However, it will be necessary for the Government to put in place the necessary legislation and to provide active assistance in relation to such matters as appropriate international government-to-government agreements.
      </para>
      <para>
       As noted in my Press Release of 19 February, the purpose of the AIDC Ltd activity is to determine if there is a single substantial proponent with access to the financial, technical and management resources which will be necessary to complete the next phase of the spaceport's development and with whom the Government can proceed with confidence.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is therefore, not really a matter of choosing a proponent; rather it is a matter of vetting and accepting proof of the credentials of those who wish to be the proponent. The final composition of any spaceport consortium will remain a matter for resolution within the commercial marketplace.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The first part of AIDC Ltd's task is to review and confirm the commercial viability of the project. This is due to be completed by the end of May or in early June. They will then prepare an investment package and conduct negotiations with commercial/industrial interests to establish a proponent. This may take until about mid-October 1991.
