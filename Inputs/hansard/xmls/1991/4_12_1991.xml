        —by leave—I claim to have been misrepresented. In his speech concluding the second reading debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, Senator Bolkus claimed that I, presumably as Attorney-General in the Fraser Government, had no regard for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is totally untrue. If Senator Bolkus had really made a careful study of it he would have known it to be untrue. Presumably, these words were thrown away quite gratuitously.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The record shows that it was the Fraser Government—and it was my responsibility as the Attorney-General in that Government—which took the steps required to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by Australia. That was not something that had been achieved by the Whitlam Labor Government. It certainly was a matter which was high on the agenda of the Fraser Government. It was something that required a great deal of negotiation and discussion with the States to ensure that Australian laws—State and Federal—were in order so that we could make that ratification. After that process, as a government, we duly ratified the International Covenant and gave further effect to its operation in Australia by establishing the Human Rights Commission. That body was set up shortly afterwards.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        In addition to this record of the Fraser Government and myself as Attorney-General in relation to human rights and civil liberties, we also introduced and passed through this Parliament, after a great deal of debate and lengthy consideration, the Freedom of Information Act. We also brought into operation the important legislation in relation to administrative review and the requirement of public servants and Ministers to give reasons for their decisions. So I have been totally misrepresented by what Senator Bolkus said in this debate. I would be happy to debate my record with that of Senator Bolkus on matters of human rights.

        —by leave—I claim to have been misrepresented. In Senator Durack claiming to have been misrepresented, I think some confusion might have emanated from what he may have taken me to have said this morning. I quoted what Senator Durack said on 14 February 1986. He said, `We will not join in an international covenant to bring human rights to everybody'. I made the point that, although Senator Durack had been a previous Attorney-General in a Liberal government, I thought it reflected on his attitude to human rights. I also went on to make some points about the Opposition's current attitude to international covenants in light of that. That might give Senator Durack a different flavour of what I said this morning.

         I will be fascinated to see the Democrats' response, because this is what Senator Coulter seized upon to beat Senator Powell about the head with when he took over the leadership of his Party. It was something that was very important to individual Democrats in society and to the loose-knit interest groups that support the Australian Democrats. To try to rectify the position that Senator Powell found herself in, she made the remark to me in writing that `political advertising will not be banned', and now we have the Democrats coming in here making a deal with Senator Bolkus and the Labor Party to ban political advertising.

         —I support Senator Parer's motion because there is no doubt that there is a clear need to split the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill into two Bills. There cannot be proper consideration of these two quite disparate matters in the present Bill, as is evidenced by the extraordinary position changing of the Australian Democrats, which clearly relates to deal-doing rather than the merits of the issue. The merits of this case are quite clear, and the Opposition has stated that it is in favour of improving the political reporting of funding. There has been no resiling from the position that was outlined by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).

         The other part of the Bill, which is clearly and distinctly separate, is one on which there is universal disagreement amongst the great bulk of Australians, judging not only from opinion polls but also from the representations made by interest groups, quite apart from the human rights considerations raised by a Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There is no doubt that the part of the Bill which relates to banning of political advertising does not have universal support. It is so strongly opposed by the Opposition that we wished to state how strongly we did oppose it by sitting here all night, in view of the undemocratic way in which the Government had put a guillotine on a Bill that relates to basic fundamental principles of democracy.

         As has been pointed out, there is no doubt that the Australian Democrats at one stage purported to support the view that the Bill should be split and, as Senator Parer said, that political advertising would not be banned. This underlines the point that former Senator Puplick made in this place following another such remarkable change of heart by the Democrats. He said that he agreed totally with the view that the Australian Democrats could not be bought, because it was evident that they could only be hired by the hour.

         There is no doubt that the Australian Democrats once again have changed their position. I outlined earlier, during the second reading debate, how former senators Macklin and Colin Mason, both Deputy Leaders of that Party, strongly supported the idea of political advertising but simply wanted to make certain that people involved in political advertising had the same burden as the rest of the community to make their advertising honest. One can sympathise with their objectives, even though their methods of achieving it may have been open to some discussion.

         Clearly, the money that is paid to political candidates and to political parties can be used in a variety of ways. It can be used to support campaigns in other than the electronic media and, indeed, is so used and will be increasingly used if the political broadcasting provisions relating to the electronic media pass the Senate. The question of the overall expenditure of public and private moneys on political campaigns is a major concern of mine, whether that be through the electronic media or by other means; for example, if the political broadcasts aspect of the Bill goes through, by innumerable other means which have been canvassed during the second reading debate.

         As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which dealt with this issue some time ago and which went through all the aspects of political broadcasting and political advertising, I must say that I can see a difference between one aspect of the Bill and the other aspect. I mention that because those of us who were on that Committee know full well that considerable amounts of money were injected into party organisations which were not overtly for the campaign process but were utilised through third parties and by political parties, apart from the periods of the election campaign.

         The argument was put by Senator Baume in a way which actually proves my point up to the hilt. He said that we are supporting this legislation because we will get more advertising under this regime than we could afford. In other words, he is saying that we are not entitled to the 11 per cent—which is related to the amount of support at the last election, and which under a fully democratic system would be the amount of advertising to which we would be properly and democratically entitled—because we could not afford it. That, of course, goes right to the heart of the matter.

         The purpose of giving an instruction to the Committee of the Whole to split the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 is that it is our view that this Bill is made up of two parts which clearly can be differentiated. One is the ban on advertising on television and radio. The other one is in relation to disclosure of donations to political parties. Right from the beginning, it has been the consistent view of the Opposition that under no circumstances would we support anything that would in any way infringe on the freedom of political expression and freedom of speech in this country.

          With regard to disclosure, from the beginning the coalition has made it quite clear, and we have been absolutely consistent, that we will support disclosure of donations to political parties on the condition that there is sufficient protection against intimidation by either a hostile government or third parties against a donor and that a donor is protected against coercion to make a donation to a political party.

          The other aspect is that the donations to political parties should be fair and equitable as regards the donors to those political parties. In the evidence provided to the Select Committee, it was patently obvious that the Australian Labor Party, because it is the political arm of the trade union movement, has substantial benefits available to it that are not available to any other political party in this country. The reason for that is the affiliation fees paid to the Labor Party. I know that the Labor Party disputes this figure, but on my own calculation it would appear that some $4m to $5m goes into Labor Party coffers.

That was spelt out very clearly in the Cooke report relating to when the clerks union in Queensland decided to affiliate with the ALP—at a meeting, I might say, which Wayne Goss attended. He encouraged them to affiliate, simply to get the $30,000, I presume; but it also guaranteed them access to Ministers and an influence on policy.

          In summary, the Opposition believes that the Bill should be split in the committee stage. We are totally opposed to anything that would infringe on political freedoms and freedom of speech in this country. It is very important that the young people of this country do not get themselves into a position where a government, as this Government is now doing, introduces a Bill which will not just stifle but kill all dissent during an election campaign. It would prevent anyone, whether they be in a Federal, State or local election, taking out an advertisement on a radio station. Radio advertising is the cheapest form of advertising within all of the media groups. It is cheaper than newspaper advertising and it is a lot cheaper than television advertising.

Irrespective of what Senator Coulter says about waffling, we have made that very clear from the outset. We have not deviated one bit. I wish I could say the same for the Democrats. The Democrats deviated not just last month or last week but deviate on a daily basis. It is impossible to understand the direction in which the Democrats are going. I notice that some of the proposals that the Democrats are putting, or not accepting from the Opposition point of view, do not even follow their policy. What does it all mean?

I just want to point to Senator Macdonald's comments about all of our supporters suddenly contacting us and faxing us. Senator Macdonald well knows that the President of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Professor Goldsworthy, has put out a press release. In that press release is the dishonest representation of our commitment to accept an increase in Senate public funding. I said last night that we stated on 9 April that we would not accept an increase in Senate public funding levels. Nevertheless, Professor Goldsworthy's press release makes this statement. It is in response to Professor Goldsworthy's press release and the list of fax numbers and telephone numbers on the bottom of it that the Opposition supporters and donors are faxing us—not Democrat supporters. Our supporters do not receive Professor Goldsworthy's press releases.

          This guillotine is again a misrepresentation. It is a guillotine, but the Opposition is saying that this is the most important piece of legislation on the books of this Parliament. I said last night—and I will repeat it—that I felt very passionately about the future of telecommunications in this country. The Opposition did not care less. It agreed with the Government. We were restructuring the whole telecommunications industry, there were massive ramifications for Australian consumers, and we gave that about eight hours debate. That is the Opposition's priority; this is my priority. I do not see why the Opposition would say that this is the most important matter.

          This Bill is about disclosure; this Bill is about political advertising. Why can the Australian Democrats not officially disclose the benefit that they will be receiving under this Bill—a benefit which is unique to the Australian Democrats compared with any other political parties and interest groups, and particularly the smaller political parties? This is a unique benefit that Senator Kernot, Senator Coulter and their colleagues are about to give themselves. We want the Democrats and the Government to disclose this massive benefit.

It is a massive benefit. We have now been setting out the figures for the last 15 to 16 hours, and each time Senator Kernot has come into this chamber she has ducked the issue and avoided disclosing the Australian Democrats' own figures on the benefit that they will receive as a result of this Bill.

Senator Kernot says that she has had plenty of time to review the evidence, and I think that is a fair enough point—she has had plenty of time to review the evidence. She has been in constant consultation with Senator Bolkus on this matter and there is no argument that, as a result, she has been fully informed and fully briefed on the Government's Bill and its amendments.

The main assumption that Senator Kemp asked us to address today is the value of the time made available in this so-called talking heads exhibition. What is the value of two minutes of broadcast time in which there is no opportunity to play jingles and generally conduct the song and dance that we see in other advertisements in the commercial sphere at the moment?

I restate that because the Political Broadcast and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, which we are looking at today, does not touch on this at all. It does not stop this abuse in any way.

          Mr Sherry came before this Committee and gave evidence to its Chairman, Senator Schacht, and members from this side of the chamber. Mr Sherry said that advertisements had been taken out in the newspapers and in leaflets which were handed out, saying that people should raise money to make sure that the wives and children of striking workers were fed and looked after. He was able to go through the files of the various unions because he was a student doing a PhD at the university; otherwise, he would not have had access. The union people thought he was friendly, so they said to him, `Photostat anything you want to'. He did.

         That sort of abuse, as Senator Schacht knows, is not legislated for in the Bill we have before us. The Labor Party has sunk so low that it grabs the funds specially donated by other unionists and specially donated by pensioners. There are many examples concerning money sent in by pensioners. That sort of abuse cannot be stopped when the Labor Party will sink so low as to steal the funds specially raised through advertisements and leaflets being handed around. Why the hypocrisy?

It has said that at no time during the year can anyone place an advertisement on radio or television in any way critical of the Government, of the Opposition or of any other party. Not only that, but no organisation, no charity, no individual, no-one representing Federal, State or local government, can put any advertisement in the electronic media that could even be interpreted as trying to say something critical of any political party.

Here we have known complete freedom of our press, complete freedom of speech and complete democracy—not the Labor democracy I have spoken about so many times in this place. Labor democracy is no democracy at all. There is a secret ballot in the party room but, because the factions will not allow the system to work, after the secret ballot people are forced to show their vote to factional members to prove that they have voted the way their faction tells them. That is Labor democracy. We on this side of the chamber will have nothing to do with it.

Who do people reckon pays the ABC bill? The taxpayers pay it. The taxpayers will pay for six minutes every day. The commercial stations will be forced by this Government to donate part of their time for these so-called free advertisements.

The Committee agreed to his coming to give evidence. He came down from Brisbane, appeared before the Committee and started reading extensively from notes in his opening statement. When we asked him why he could not have given a copy of that submission to the members of the Committee beforehand, he said that it had been taken off his word processor overnight and, therefore, was not available.

          The Committee ran out of time. The Senate sat at 10 o'clock on the Thursday and he had not finished giving evidence. But it was already clear to me that most of his evidence was absolutely irrelevant to the terms of reference. I agreed with Opposition senators that we immediately move a motion in the Senate that the Committee sit again at a later hour that day so that he could complete his evidence, even though as Chairman I had grave suspicions that any of his further evidence would not be within the terms of reference. Nevertheless, I supported that motion, as did the Government, when it would have been very easy not to grant leave. So we had an extra hour later that afternoon.

I let him do that, but I thought it was only appropriate that at the end of his evidence I make a comment to him because he had said that he had never taken any of this evidence to the appropriate authorities—even though he was accusing people of clear criminal intent, intimidation, threats, fraud and so on. During the previous three years he had not been near any of the royal commissions in Queensland, he had never gone to the Queensland police or any other authority, State or Federal, with his evidence.

I can simply evidence that corruption here and now.

          That corruption involves the power to be given to the electronic media commentators, who will be permitted to run whatever they like on political matters in their programs, while the political parties are refused the right to use advertising to respond to or deny what this specially selected and honoured group of people is to be able to do under the extraordinary powers given by this legislation.

          Quite apart from the general question as to whether it is remarkable that advertisements in newspapers are good advertisements and are to be allowed but advertisements on radio, which are cheaper than newspaper advertisements, are somehow dishonourable and disgraceful and are not to be allowed—neither are television advertisements—the scope for corruption is self-evident. By way of evidence of not just the scope for corruption but of the existence of pressure from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) through a media proprietor in an election campaign, I refer to the situation in one of Brian Burke's Western Australian State election campaigns when McCann-Erickson Advertising Pty Ltd was briefed to handle Brian Burke's personal advertising campaign.

          and to incorporate it in the commercial. McCann-Erickson initially tried to get it through the local channel in Perth—STW9 Perth. It in turn tried to get it from Channel 9 Sydney but to no avail. In fact, the request raised the ire of STW9's eastern States' counterpart because it did not want its material to be used in television advertising of a political nature.

          When McCann-Erickson advised Burke that it was unable to obtain it and, of course, mentioned that to lift it from the program was illegal, Burke said that he would fix it up. Burke certainly went about fixing it up because McCann-Erickson then received a telephone call from the Prime Minister's office in which an officer asked what it was that McCann-Erickson wanted from

           60 Minutes
          </emphasis>
          at that time—who, once reassured that neither he nor the program would be compromised and provided that there would be utmost confidentiality as to the source of the footage requested, advised that he would arrange for raw footage as opposed to a dub from the program to be sent to McCann-Erickson in Perth. It arrived the next day and was included in the advertisement in accordance with Brian Burke's instructions.

          I mention in passing that the production company for the series of commercials, Taimac, had Laurie Connell as a majority shareholder in the same little quaint circle of friends in Western Australia or, should we say, mates. To enable McCann-Erickson to produce the campaign without being seen to be involved with a political candidate or party, the commercials were produced for a phantom client called Turi Nominees. This was a front company owned by Mr Salvatore Salpietro, which was ultimately wound up at a cost to its creditors of something like $120,000.

          The costs for the campaign, which had no budget, were paid from Brian Burke's office to McCann-Erickson from the now infamous advertising accounts Nos 1 and 2. No cheques were received, as I understand it, from Turi Nominees, the front company. Although Brian Burke's office administered the two advertising accounts, while waiting for funds to be donated to these vehicles, on occasions payment to McCann-Erickson was made from Labor Party funds administered by now Senator Michael Beahan who, quite understandably, wanted to know what was going on.

          with huge audiences could be so subject to mateship that, as in this case, they would make available something that should not be available to a Premier for his advertising campaign? If there were no advertising campaign, what other favours would be done to mates in this situation?

          There are three important points that need to be addressed in looking at the subject matter. First, is the time that is confiscated from the commercial television stations property? Secondly, if it is property, has there been an acquisition of it by either the Commonwealth or another party? Thirdly, if there has been such an acquisition of the property, has it been on just terms? Those reasons are pertinent because of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Section 51 states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          (xxxi) the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         That becomes the only relevant clause in the Constitution, and the only clause that can give power for this legislation, because of the case law. It is quite clear. First, I refer to the case of Clunies Ross v. the Commonwealth, reported at 155 CLR. In that case, the joint judgment of the six judges of the High Court declared:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The plenary grant of legislative power contained in section 51(xxxi) has assumed the status of constitutional guarantee of just terms, as established in the Minister for the Army v. Dalziel (1944). It is to be given the liberal construction appropriate to such a constitutional provision.
        </para>
        <para>
         The case cited is the Attorney-General v. Schmidt. The most up-to-date case, decided on only 29 October 1991, is the case of Peverill v. Health Insurance Commission, heard in the Federal Court of Australia by Burchett J., who said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To construe a constitutional guarantee narrowly would be by that to diminish it and the Constitution. Repeatedly, and in various forms, this fundamental principle is laid down in the cases.
        </para>
        <para>
         He goes on to cite cases where that has been determined. What he is saying is that section 51 (xxxi) is to be construed as a guarantee and that, further, it is to be construed in a liberal way. As we go through the case law we will see that `property' is to be widely interpreted, not simply in terms of whether it is an estate in fee simple or something of the like.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The case law also establishes that one may not avoid the guarantee by using a circuitous method and using a statute which one believes could avoid that guarantee. Isaacs J., in a 1926 case, Commonwealth and Commonwealth Oil Refineries Ltd v. South Australia, states that, if a statute transgresses a constitutional prohibition either specifically or in a circuitous manner, then it will be struck down as well.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          So there are three important things that we have established: first, that the Constitution implies a guarantee; secondly, that the word `property' is to be broadly construed, that is, liberally construed; and, thirdly, that one may not avoid the guarantee by using a circuitous method and using a statute which one believes could avoid that guarantee.

          Isaacs J. said that the test to be applied to the impugned legislation is the substance of the operation of the statute rather than merely its form. But the pivotal case remains the Minister of State for the Army v. Dalziel, the 1944 case that I mentioned previously. In that case, Latham, the then Chief Justice, made the statement:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The provision in the Constitution is plainly intended for the protection of the subject, and should be liberally interpreted.
        </para>
        <para>
         Rich J. in the same case went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What we are concerned with is not a private document creating rights inter partes, but a Constitution containing a provision of a fundamental character designed to protect citizens from being deprived of their property by the Sovereign State except upon just terms.
        </para>
        <para>
         The meaning of property in such a connection must be determined upon general principles of jurisprudence, not by the artificial refinements of any particular legal system or by reference to Sheppard's Touchstone. The language used is perfectly general. It says `the acquisition of property'; it is not restricted to acquisition by particular methods or of particular types of interest, nor to particular types of property. It extends to any acquisition of any interest in any property. It authorises such acquisition, but it expressly imposes two conditions on every such acquisition. It must be upon just terms and it must be for `a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make the laws'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The important thing here is that by any definition the property which is being acquired by the Commonwealth to be handed over to a third party, that is, in this case, the Democrats, the Labor Party, or indeed the Liberal Party for that matter, is property which has been seized, which has been acquired. The point that it has been acquired is borne out by the fact that it is passed over to somebody else to use and do something with. When one looks at whether or not there are just terms provided for this acquisition, one must answer no.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          To recap, so we understand, we have property which is being acquired—and, in the words of the Constitution and the case law interpretation, it may only be so acquired on just terms. If it fails that test, it is ultra vires the Constitution and it fails. In other words, the deal that has been put together by the Democrats with the Labor Party—that they, in return for whatever it is they have agreed to, get their talking heads commercials free to them but at the expense of somebody else in the run-up to the election—is ultra vires and not valid legislation.

          Look again at the case of Minister of State for the Army v. Dalziel. I have read the portion of Latham C.J. and Rich J. Mr Justice Burchett, in the case that I have mentioned, dated 29 October 1991, says quite clearly that he takes that case to mean:

         . . . s. 51(xxxi) is not to be confined pedantically to the taking of title by the Commonwealth to some specific estate or interest in land recognized at law or in equity and to some specific form of property in a chattel or chose in action similarly recognized, but that it extends to innominate and anomalous interests and includes the assumption and indefinite continuance of exclusive possession and control for the purposes of the Commonwealth of any subject of property. Section 51 (xxxi) serves a double purpose. It provides the Commonwealth Parliament with a legislative power of acquiring property: at the same time as a condition upon the exercise of the power it provides the individual or the State, affected with a protection against governmental interferences with his proprietary rights without just recompense. In both aspects consistency with the principles upon which constitutional provisions are interpreted and applied demands that the paragraph should be given as full and flexible an operation as will cover the objects it was designed to effect. Moreover, when a constitution undertakes to forbid or restrain some legislative course, there can be no prohibition to which it is more proper to apply the principle embodied . . . In requiring just terms s. 51(xxxi) fetters the legislative power by forbidding laws with respect to acquisition on any terms that are not just.

         In Trade Practices Commission v. Tooth and Co. Ltd, as reported in CLR 142 at page 403, Barwick, C.J., as he then was, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It has been decided, and in my respectful opinion quite correctly, that the presence of s. 51(xxxi) in the Constitution means that no other head of power, including the incidental power, would support a law for the acquisition of property.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, this is the only head of power in the Constitution which allows the Commonwealth to acquire that property. The reason is plain. The constitutional purpose is to ensure that in no circumstance will a law of the Commonwealth provide for the acquisition of property except upon just terms.

          Section 51 is a very great constitutional safeguard not confined to the protection of the citizen from the confiscation of his property by the state. It ensures that no-one may by virtue of a Commonwealth statutory provision acquire his property except on just terms. Again, Gibbs picks up the question of a circuitous device saying that it simply will not be permitted to circumvent that clause of the Constitution.

          On the question of the need for an acquisition to take place, as distinct from merely depriving someone of something, there is again relevant case law in the Tasmanian dams case. In the interests of time, I recommend people to the judgments of Justices Mason, Brennan and Deane, wherein they state very clearly that there has to be an acquisition of the property. Indeed, the important words of Brennan J, were:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Where neither the Commonwealth nor any other person acquires property rights under a law of the Commonwealth, there is no acquisition upon which the paragraph may fasten.
        </para>
        <para>
         But clearly in this case there is an acquisition of proprietary rights which are conferred upon third parties, as is encompassed in that statement of Brennan, J. The fact of the matter is that we have established that the time that is confiscated by the Government is property and there is an acquisition of it. We then come to the third point I raised at the beginning, and that is the question of whether it is acquired on just terms. Again, we can go to the case law, where it says that there is a simple definition of `just terms'. Mr Justice Starke in the Bank of New South Wales v. the Commonwealth said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . "just terms" require that a party whose property is acquired shall have the pecuniary equivalent of the property acquired.
        </para>
        <para>
         Quite clearly, this legislation does not provide for that. As I said at the beginning in speaking to the motion moved by Senator Parer, that the two of parts of the Bill should be separated and dealt with as two entirely separate pieces of legislation is not only reasonable but is logical, sensible and equitable. The Democrats have been placed in a position where they have had some legal advice and some advices made available to them—advices which I might say at this stage I have not seen but which I would be interested in looking at.

          This area is one in which a prima facie case has been made out that this legislation could indeed be ultra vires the Constitution. As such, any reasonable man, or indeed any reasonable Minister, would consider that it is a logical and sensible course of action to now deal with the question of disclosure but to leave the question of whether this legislation either is or can be made valid so that proper investigation can be made. In fairness to the people with whom the Government has offered a deal—the Democrats—and in their own interests, it would be sensible for them to look at what sort of deal it is that they have struck.

The Government has, of course, had advice on the provisions from time to time, and more particularly had advice on them at the start of this process. The matter that has been raised by Senator Bishop has been raised, probably chapter and verse, by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, FACTS, the industry lobby group in this area.

          I do not need to say much more to the Senate other than that we have discussed this with the appropriate people who advise government. The advice that I have been given is that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Senator Bishop may jump up again, so I say that that advice has been verbal. It has had to be verbal because of the short time that we have had. The advice, which was very clear and succinct, was that this approach has absolutely no legs.

          I do not doubt that Senator Bishop and her friends around the place will possibly consider a challenge—Nick Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales, has already indicated that. But I say to the Opposition and to anyone who might be listening that the advice on the initial Bill made it clear that the Government was acting within the parameters of the Constitution. The advice on the free time provisions was very succinct and, as I say, the argument has no legs.

          The Bill as it now stands with the Government amendments is such that during an election campaign all paid advertising on the electronic media—radio and television—will be banned. This applies to Federal, State and local government elections. It also means that at any time during the election period—which is defined from the close of nominations to the election date—no third party can pay for any advertisement on radio and television. We understand the position with regard to television, that it is a costly exercise; we are totally mystified as to why it should apply to radio.

          Regarding so-called free advertising, there is no such thing as free advertising because someone has to pay. In respect of television, the television stations have to pay. According to the calculations made by my colleague Senator Kemp, supported by Senator Kernot of the Democrats, during an election period the cost to the three television stations covering the Sydney area alone would be of the order of $5m. If one extrapolates that out to the rest of Australia one sees the amount of money involved. One sees the amount of about $1.8m that would accrue to the Australian Democrats on so-called free advertisements paid for by the commercial television stations that, financially, have been in diabolical trouble.

          The coalition seeks to amend some of the Government's amendments. I will touch on the key amendments briefly; I will not go through the more minor ones. One of them is to remove the Territories and States from the coverage of this legislation on the basis that the role of this Parliament is to cover Federal elections. It is up to the States and the Territories to then make their own decisions as to what they want to do with regard to advertising during election campaigns. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talks a lot about federalism and cooperative federalism and this just shows how phoney his arguments are.

          The Opposition also wishes to amend the Government's deal with the Australian Democrats to have so-called talking heads. It should be made clear to everyone that this legislation means that on television we can have visible to the public only the head and shoulders of the person who is speaking, and the ad must run for a minimum of two minutes. The aim, as has been said by many newspaper reporters, is to make it boring, boring, boring, so that people will not watch television.

          I have heard Senator Coulter speak on this matter on a number of occasions and I think it is fascinating that the Australian Democrats introduced a talking heads proposal which they pinched from France. It is appropriate that it was the French who discovered the guillotine, and we have talking heads. Wonderful—a cartoonist's delight, I might say.

Without that, as various newspaper reports have said, the concept is absolutely idiotic. It is like going on television to sell a motor car without showing the car.

I listened very carefully to most speeches last night and particularly to Senator Sowada's contribution. I certainly acknowledge that she did create a very attractive ivory tower and, like Rapunzel, sat at the top of it and supported the opposition to this legislation. However, I do not think Senator Sowada appreciates on what a dreadful foundation that ivory tower rests. The material which this Bill seeks to remove just in those final few weeks of campaigning, in 99 per cent of the cases involved, no matter who produced it, is garbage, is offensive and adds nothing. It might be clever marketing and advertising, but it does not add anything to democracy and free speech.

          I conclude by making my case. The last election campaign in the Northern Territory—this would be of interest to all people interested in political analysis and certainly the academics—was the most extraordinary ever run in Australia. I have never seen a campaign like it. The only campaigns I have seen similar to it have been the many television campaigns run in the United States. Some of those campaigns are beyond belief in terms of the negative campaigning for which the US has become famous.

About a fortnight ago, Terry Smith resigned from the Parliament, I regret to say, and left the Northern Territory to live in Victoria.

         This proposal means that people unemployed for 12 months would be made to work for 80 per cent of the award rate. The title `Austrain' suggests that this is an on-the-job training program for the unemployed, but it is quite clear from the documentation that no training requirement resides with the employer. Therefore, it is not a training program; it is a cheap labour scheme and, because it abolishes Jobstart, it removes any possibility of there being a training operation. This is a straight out cheap labour scheme which forces people to work for exploitation level wages. My colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training called it `Austslave' rather than `Austrain', and he is dead right about that.

         This scheme distorts the labour market in two ways. First of all, workers who are required to work at 80 per cent of the minimum award rate—that is, 20 per cent below the fair rate as decided by the Industrial Relations Commission—are required to work for 18 months at that rate and then go on to the 100 per cent rate. After 18 months it is easy to see that unscrupulous employers will, in fact, sack workers employed under this scheme.

         It is a deliberate and intended policy. There are no unintended consequences about this; this is an intended policy. If we look at the industrial relations policy of the Opposition, we see that it is aimed at removing award protection for Australian workers, removing the Industrial Relations Commission, removing unions from the scene and, of course, introducing a consumption tax which will hike prices by 15 per cent.

It is a frightening irony that a speech such as this should be given in the name of such a distinguished former president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as Sir Richard. If one looks at the speech, one can see that Dr Hewson, a former professor of economics, does not understand, or does not appear to understand, the basic and fundamental concept of a minimum rates award.

         Minimum rates awards, of course, almost universally come from the Industrial Relations Commission. They are awards based on what the industry sector can afford to pay. They are couched so that the weakest employer in that industry sector can afford to pay those rates. They are, in effect, a true minimum. Employers can and do make over-award payments; where there are unionised workplaces there is often a formalised agreement. In non-union shops, over-award payments are often made by agreement between the individual worker and the employer. The concept of a minimum rates award is fundamental and basic to industrial relations in this country. What did Dr Hewson say about it?  He said that differences in wages between individuals in the same company did not occur, differences between companies in the same industries did not occur, and differences between industries did not exist. He went on to say that firms in Broome, Geelong, Sydney, Melbourne or Townsville would have to pay a uniform amount regardless of their particular circumstances.

         Quite clearly, Dr Hewson does not understand the concept of minimum rates awards and how employers, who have a financially stronger position and have greater productivity than the minimum employer performance in their industry sector or who are more profitable, in fact pay above the awards. As well, Dr Hewson is not speaking the truth when he says that there is uniformity in award rates.

         I quote from a survey conducted in the metal trades industry in March 1989. It is a survey on the dispersion of incomes for process workers across the metal trades area. Across the metal trades industries in Australia, the weekly wage for process workers varied between $270 and $514 per week. So much for the uniformity between Broome and Geelong. The survey found that the weekly wage for a fitter varied between $344 and $711 a week. It has to be said that that is the finding of an objective survey. All of those occupations in this industry sector are covered by the same metal trades minimum rates award. There are clearly differences between individuals; there are clearly differences between companies; and the metal trades industry differs from other industry sectors.

         What Opposition members have said, and one of the reasons why the Government will not follow this course, is that industrial relations is the key area of difference between us and them and the key issue in the so-called `Frightpack' that they have produced. In that document of over 500 pages there are only one and a bit pages devoted to industrial relations, so we remain somewhat in the dark about it. What we do know is that Dr Hewson is wrong on some very fundamental points.

The loan will be provided through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The basis of the decision was the benefit to Australian industry and it was subject to the condition that the loan would be used by the Philippines to build patrol boats at the Carrington shipyards and not on any preconditions imposed by the Philippines Government.

         I will come in a minute to whether the Government's forecasts are being delivered, but last week's foreign debt figure shows a stabilisation of Australia's foreign debt at about 35 per cent of GDP—not the 54 per cent which the Opposition is proudly talking about. Over the last three years the ratio of net foreign debt to GDP has been about 34 or 35 per cent and, over the last year, that has levelled out leading to a fall in the debt servicing burden of this country from 21 per cent of exports in 1990 to 19 per cent of exports in the September quarter 1991.

The package which is offered as an alternative presents a very big threat to this task, with its expected boost to inflation and interest rates and its totally fallacious claims on productivity improvement. Under the high road scenario, as Senator Bishop said yesterday, that figure would be 54 per cent of GDP.

         Under this Government the export orientation of this country has changed enormously. The performance of manufactured exporters in this country is the best in the OECD countries. We do not retreat from that, and the performance of the manufacturing sector in exports is something of which all Australians ought to be proud.

         The Opposition always tries to distort the record of industrial relations in this country, but what Nick Greiner has said is accurate in many respects. He said that `when it comes to wages, strikes, inflation and economic growth figures Australia suffers from miscast perceptions and unfair stereotyping'. He is referring of course to that period of the Hawke Government during which we have had moderate wage outcomes and a dramatic drop in strike levels and to the fact that we are now below the OECD countries in inflation levels. However, to some extent there is an unfair stereotyping and perception that those things have not been achieved.

         Mr Greiner has said that strikes have declined by 70 per cent. Certainly it is true that the numbers of strikes have declined. If one compares the Fraser years with the Hawke years, it is ours over the Liberals by 61 per cent. I am not quite sure how Mr Greiner calculates 70 per cent. He may be choosing the high point of massive confrontation during the Fraser years and then declining from that level, picking up the reduction in strikes during the 1982-83 recession that the Opposition caused.

         It is true that cooperation has overtaken confrontation in the Australian workplace and that we have engaged in award restructuring and workplace reform.

It is also true that inflation is at a 20-year low.

         I should also say that Australia would do better on all of these indicators if New South Wales lifted its game. It is true that the Greiner Government has dragged up the figures on strike levels when the rest of Australia has shown that it can perform better than New South Wales. To August 1991, the rate of industrial disputes in New South Wales was 50.7 per cent higher than the Australian average. If those opposite want to say that New South Wales is a manufacturing State, I point out that industrial disputes in Victoria were 23.9 per cent lower than the national average. In comparing Victoria and New South Wales, I emphasise that while Victoria was 23.9 per cent lower than the national average, New South Wales was 50.7 per cent higher.

         Mr Greiner could help our national profile and overseas markets if he did something about his own backyard. When one looks at Mr Greiner's own backyard, one sees that in the New South Wales Government sector, in the rail area and the hospital and medical sectors, there have been disputes because the Government has mismanaged its public sector policy.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There was a massive dispute in New South Wales only recently when the Government brought in confrontationist industrial legislation. Perhaps I can offer some advice to Mr Greiner. He should get off the New Zealand road; he should copy the legislation that we have to improve industrial relations; and he should start trying to bring Australians together to work together in the workplace, rather than confronting them and involving himself in industrial conflict.

         Initially our view was that the most productive avenue for such a UN involvement might be for the head of the UN Centre for Human Rights, Mr Martenson, to visit Jakarta for discussions with the Indonesian authorities in the context of a seminar on human rights that was proposed to be held in Indonesia this month. That meeting has, for a variety of reasons, now been deferred, notwithstanding our representations and those of a number of others. We now understand that the United Nations Secretary-General has decided to send the UN Commission on Human Rights special rapporteur on summary or arbitrary executions, Mr Amos Wako, to visit Indonesia in pursuit of his mandate to investigate incidents of this kind. That is an existing mandate which is vested in him by the UN Commission on Human Rights, of which Indonesia is currently a member, and certainly that mandate, in our judgment, would extend to scrutiny of the events that occurred on 12 November.

Accordingly, a few hours ago I instructed the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to convey to the Indonesian authorities our view that they should receive and fully cooperate with the special rapporteur.

         It is certainly our hope that the involvement of the special rapporteur, and perhaps UN involvement in other ways still to be explored, would enhance the international acceptability of the processes of investigation into the events of and the events surrounding 12 November. I make it clear in answer to the honourable senator's further question that the Australian Government does support all efforts to investigate not only the Santa Cruz killings themselves but also any associated allegations of abuse of human rights, including any allegations of subsequent executions.

         I might say, a little more generally and finally, that we do believe that the UN can play a positive role not only in respect of this immediate investigation but also in developing an understanding of and a respect for international standards of human rights in Indonesia through existing human rights mechanisms, and the UN could seek to improve the humanitarian situation in East Timor and help with the longer term resolution and reconciliation of the East Timorese problem. I repeat that the Government, in a variety of ways and through a variety of channels, will continue to explore such options.

Why has the Government chosen to ignore its own draft Skillshare disability strategy paper which advocates the provision of additional modular funding from 1992 onwards for Skillshare projects that meet set targets in terms of clients with disabilities? Does the fact that DEET continues to distribute this draft strategy paper, although its contents are not reflected in the 1992 Skillshare guidelines, indicate that the Government should get its own house in order instead of making spurious claims about the coalition's policy in relation to people with disabilities?

         I am further informed that, while recognising the good work done over the years through specialist projects, unfortunately it is the view of the Minister that this has had the effect of marginalising the provision of employment services and skills training to a comparatively small number of people with disabilities. Specifically, the problem has been that the new program guidelines have clarified the responsibility of generic Skillshare projects and the roles and functions of disability access support units have clearly indicated that additional outreach funding is available to the Skillshare projects to assist people with disabilities.

He says, in conclusion, that it is always the case that when strategies for public policies are developed in consultation with a number of interest groups, there will be conflicting views expressed and not all ideas will be able to be included in the final document.

        —Senator Button has not listened to many commentators if he thinks that. During Question Time, in response to a question from Senator Maguire, Senator Button ranged very widely over a series of statistics, from interest rates to foreign debt to living standards and the like. Most of those so-called facts that he gave in his answer were either wrong or, at the very best, misleading, and I wish to address my remarks to two or three of them.

        Firstly, I address interest rates. In that context, Senator Button referred to the Syntec report which was released yesterday and reported in today's press. It claims that under the coalition's Fightback proposals, in the short term, interest rates would rise very steeply before falling very considerably later in the decade.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        So far as the Syntec allegation is concerned, Syntec has made much the same mistake as that made by the Government in its analysis of the package. The Syntec forecasters have predicted an after-GST increase in the CPI for 1994 of 9.5 per cent under the coalition's proposals. On that basis, they forecast that nominal interest rates would rise to 13 per cent during the next term of government, which will be the first term of a coalition government. Presumably, Syntec made that forecast by adding an assessment of the real interest rate to apply in that year to the inflation rate. That simplistic rule of thumb may work in some situations, but why would nominal interest rates rise because of the GST when the GST has only a one-off impact on inflation, and when that one-off increase will be fully accommodated by monetary policy settings and by income tax reductions—

        —Just let me finish. Senator Walsh can have his go. From reading his column yesterday, he does not even understand how the GST works. The one-off increase in inflation will be fully accommodated by monetary policy settings and by income tax reductions which preserve the after-tax rate of return to investors, with reduced income taxes of course more than compensating for the one-off price increases. That has been made clear in the coalition's proposals from day one. The fact that the coalition will compensate low to middle income earners for the introduction of the GST through the tax and expenditure systems is precisely the approach that was going to be taken in 1985 by the Government, but that option, option C, was aborted when Bill Kelty said that he would not have it. So Syntec seems to have overlooked that quite fundamental and simple point.

        There are other things that one can say and should say about the Syntec report. We have acknowledged that our policies will lead to a one-off inflation increase. The Syntec analysis seems to assume that that increase will be ongoing and will feed on into interest rates. But there are two main reasons why that analysis is wrong.

        First of all, the coalition's industrial relations policy will reduce the power of trade union leadership by removing the legal monopoly of the trade unions. What union claiming to represent the interests of its constituency would argue for unnecessary wage increases at a time of high unemployment? Secondly, given the lower marginal rates of taxation, not to mention our savings tax incentive scheme, there is no reason at all for the after-tax return on savings to fall, even with a one-off inflation increase. Thus any additional potential upward pressure on interest rates from that source is ameliorated.

        Moreover, in a recent article by Peter Stemp, the Murphy model was used to model the inflation effects of an indirect/direct tax mix switch. It was concluded that, provided there is a consensus that there will be no flow-on wage increases in addition to the tax expenditure measures, there would be no ongoing inflationary boost. Therefore, from our point of view, that conclusion could be interpreted as follows: when we are elected on the merits of our package there will be community consensus that the tax expenditure measures outlined do compensate low to middle income earners and that that compensation is fully adequate.

        We will also be given a mandate to introduce our industrial relations policy which will reduce the power of the trade unions. Thus we will be able to ensure that that inflationary impact is one-off. If there is any suggestion that our approach to this will be any different from the Government's, let me remind the Senate of the views in 1985 of the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, who was at that time the most ardent advocate of the introduction of the GST. He was asked about the impact on inflation of the option C proposal that he was putting forward. On 12 June 1985 he addressed a dinner of the Australian Finance Conference and he said:

        —Senator Button cannot get away with misleading the Senate in the way he does every day at Question Time, when he either totally refuses to answer questions or wheels in facts that are just plain wrong. The last matter I want to mention—and I know Senator Bishop and perhaps other honourable senators will mention other matters—is Senator Button's reference today to Australia's international competitiveness, as judged by our capacity to service our foreign debt. What Senator Button did today was typical of him: he told only half the story. The figures he related today were only for Australia's foreign debt. Australia's obligations to the rest of the world are not only debt but also equity investment.

        When we include equity investment and, therefore, our total net foreign liabilities—not just our debt but debt plus equity, and we must cover the two—that tells a very different story.

Unless we wake up to the seriousness of this situation, unless we adopt the sorts of radical changes and proposals that have been put forward by Dr Hewson and the coalition in the Fightback proposals, we will never ever make a start on stabilising, let alone turning around and correcting, those conditions.

        In so doing, he confirmed that the Opposition plans a credit squeeze. What other policy settings can ensure that that is a one-off only?  There are two: it can tighten fiscal policy or it can tighten monetary policy. The Opposition has already committed itself not to tighten fiscal policy. The Opposition says that all the benefits of the expenditure cuts which it plans but has not specified, all the extra revenue which its value added tax will raise, will be totally refunded to other taxpayers in the form of personal income tax cuts.

        The Opposition has closed the door on tightening fiscal policy three years ahead of time. So there is only one thing left for the Opposition: another credit squeeze—a repetition of New Zealand. New Zealand had a one-off boost in inflation. How did it achieve that?  By pushing unemployment up by 5 percentage points. Clearly, that is what the Opposition plans to do. It has closed off the fiscal policy and there is only one policy setting left: another credit squeeze.

        The Opposition's fall back argument, of course, is that it will emasculate the trade unions—a la Thatcher, who emasculated the trade unions in the United Kingdom and pushed both unemployment and inflation up to 13 per cent. That even beat John Howard's 1982-83 record. In the UK, Thatcher, after emasculating the trade unions, managed to put both unemployment and inflation up to 13 per cent. Either the Opposition is lying when it gives people the assurance that all the benefits of its expenditure cuts and the extra revenue its value added tax raises will be entirely passed on in the form of lower personal income tax or it is planning to control the inflationary consequences of its value added tax with a credit squeeze and a 4 or 5 per cent increase in unemployment.

        I will conclude by demonstrating the disgraceful nature of this answer by referring to a couple of the Government's current training programs: one is Jobstart, which is a wage subsidy program in which the Government makes up the difference, so in principle a discount is still being paid; the other is Jobskills, which is a new initiative announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the March economic statement, which commenced from 1 July 1991. Only some weeks ago Senator Cook told the Senate that the basic award wage in this country was around $300 a week. I think he even referred to child-care workers as being on the bottom of the pile. There was no suggestion on his part that a person could get a job for less than that.

       If there is one Minister who comes into this place and prides himself on being in bed with the ACTU, doing everything it wants him to do, it is Senator Cook. He has no shame in owning up to that position. I would have thought the least he could do is to come in and acknowledge that the ACTU itself supports training programs. I will just remind him what the ACTU's 1989 youth strategy says:

        —by leave—I wish to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented. There was an article on the front page of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        this morning suggesting that the Opposition was proposing to introduce a new tax on employers as a means of implementing its low-wage assistance scheme for the jobless; in other words, Austrain. It is probably of some significance that Senator Cook did not refer to this article. The article talks about the mooted tax being a convoluted device. In a number of areas the article continues to talk in terms of a tax device and it quotes a spokesman commenting on my behalf.

        The fact is that at no stage have I or the Opposition proposed any such tax. The concept of a tax is that it is something that raises revenue. Austrain, by its very nature, is not designed to raise revenue; indeed, it is designed to save revenue. We have already committed ourselves to abolishing seven taxes. The Government has followed suit with the coal levy, and presumably it will be doing its best to continue to follow suit in due course.

        The last thing I have suggested in public is that we want to introduce new taxes. Indeed, Austrain goes in the opposite direction. Therefore, I simply want to make it clear that what is contained in that article is mere speculation about one possible alternative to initiatives that might involve the direct regulation of wages. But certainly the implementation of the Austrain program would not involve any new tax and would not, by definition, involve any new revenue raising. Indeed, quite the opposite: it will assist the Government and in particular the Minister for Finance by avoiding the need to provide social welfare benefits and other government transfer payments by having the burden borne in the private sector. I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight.

         In view of the need to get back to the business before us, which suffers the gag at 7.30 p.m., I shall be brief. I want to refer to the 1990-91 annual report of Film Australia Pty Ltd—of course the reporting period ends on 30 June 1991—because 1991 commemorates the eightieth year of Film Australia's operation, although it has not had that precise name from the time it began, on 15 November 1911. No doubt the eightieth birthday will be referred to in more detail in the next annual report, but that time is so far off that I felt it was better to refer to it today.

          Film Australia has celebrated its eightieth birthday in a number of ways. In particular, it celebrated in Canberra with a function at which it reviewed its history from its beginnings as James Pinkerton Campbell's one-man operation in 1911. It showed a film which highlighted the benefit of the work that it has done and the need for a country to record its history. Of course, the purpose of Film Australia is to record the development and building of the nation in that form.

          At a function entitled `A Moving History of Australia: Film Australia 1911—1991', the following films were shown:

          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Canberra Today &amp; Tomorrow
          </emphasis>
          , a 1959 colour film. That film was absolutely fascinating. It showed some of the young men who were behind the building and growth of the national capital—Sir John Overall and Mr Bob Lansdowne come to mind as two who were seen in it as young men, and there were lots of others whom many of us recognised.

          The film showed the growth of Canberra and the response of Canberra, even by 1959, to the decision of the Menzies Government that the nation should have a national capital of which it could be proud, and put everything into developing Canberra in the late 1950s, as we now see. The last segment was
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Tomorrow's Canberra

          , filmed in 1972, which gave us a vivid impression of Canberra at the beginning of the 1970s.

           I hope there will be more such films of the national capital to show its history, and the many others referred to in the document which, while reviewing the last year and its success as a company, also gives some background to it.

          I am disappointed—this is one of my hobbyhorses, I guess—to see that the report is dated 8 October 1991 and it comes into this chamber two months later. Unless there is some very good excuse, it is not appropriate for that sort of time delay to take place.

          I also note that the operating profit for the year—this is a corporatised organisation now—has fallen from $248,000 to just under $54,000. I would have thought that would have merited some comment in the text. It appears to have escaped the notice of the directors. It would have been appropriate to mention that—unless it has been, and I have not been able to find it in the time available to me. I think the quality of reporting could be increased.

          The key question with respect to Film Australia is: having been corporatised, what should happen to it next? There is no doubt, in our view, that it should be privatised. Mr Gonski, the Chairman, states in the report:

         There appears to be no reason why Film Australia should not move towards privatisation except that, to an extent, it still depends heavily on specific programs such as the national interest program, which will involve a $18m contract from the Federal Government over the next three years. On the other hand, the report says that that contract now accounts for less than one-third of the company's total income. I hope that it can continue to expand its revenues in that way.

          There are a few other points relating to good reporting that concern me. For example, Film Australia has gone into a joint venture with a company called SoundFirm Pty Ltd, which is described as a Sydney based company—full stop. We know nothing more about that company, other than that, in the event of a wind-up, the property in the joint venture will be equally divided between Film Australia and SoundFirm. It would be nice to know what it actually put into this. Are the assets equally owned and what is the nature of the activities?

        The Australian Film Finance Corporation is the major instrument through which the Government's assistance to film is given. Unfortunately, this report, like Film Australia's report, seems to miss making the most important point that perhaps should be made—that is, what is going to happen to the level of grants to the Film Finance Corporation in the coming financial year? I understand that the grants structure under which it existed in the year to 30 June will not exist next year. It would have been nice for that point to have been made in the report.

         I mention in passing that the date of this report also provides me with some problems in relation to timing. The report from Mr Spigelman, the Chairman, to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Simmons, is dated 11 September 1991, which is over two months ago. However, the Auditor-General's report is dated 18 October. I do not know how the report was transmitted from Film Australia to the Minister without the Auditor's report on it. Perhaps someone can explain that to me. I also noted that the Commonwealth grant fell from $74.8m to $66m in 1991. That does not appear to have been detailed in the report.

         It points out that sources of venture capital for such high risk speculative ventures as film are limited, conservative and becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to procure given the high level of guaranteed returns expected by financial intermediaries representing investors. The new onerous requirements of the corporations law in regard to offers to public fundraising is something we should have a look at. If these onerous new laws are making it difficult for proper and reasonable ventures to proceed, maybe there is a good case for examining whether we are throwing out the baby with the bath water, as the saying goes.

By contrast with Film Australia celebrating its eightieth birthday this year, the National Film and Sound Archive celebrates its sixth birthday.

        The National Capital Planning Authority came into existence when the ACT obtained self-government on 11 May 1988. It has been doing a number of things since then, particularly settling the plan of Canberra and identifying those portions of it which are the responsibility of the Commonwealth and within the national capital plan.

         The other thing that it has to do is work with the ACT Government and the ACT Planning Authority. I believe that process is working well and that people are able to see the plan of Canberra as one document and not two, although undoubtedly from time to time there will be grey areas. It is important that both the ACT Planning Authority and the National Capital Planning Authority work together so that those who wish to invest in Canberra and develop things here are able to find out what the rules and regulations are with a minimum of disruption. We do not want to drive business from Canberra because of the difficulty of working with two authorities.

         I wish to refer to Constitution Avenue, which is mentioned in a number of places in this report as the base of the triangle and an important part of the development to highlight the plan. Amongst works recommended for 1991-92 are Constitution Avenue extensions: design and construction. I stress that in my opinion the whole of Constitution Avenue needs to be designed and thought through and not just have bits done here and there and finish up either with a hotchpotch or with a decision that nobody could possibly change because this and that have been done and there are no other alternatives.

         I believe that Constitution Avenue is important. One proposal came before the last inquiry of the Joint Committee on the ACT. It had a lot about it that recommended it in many respects, but to agree that it should border on a part of Constitution Avenue before we know what is going to happen to the rest is a very difficult proposition. If no-one else wishes to speak on this report, to enable us to move on, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

          The audit revealed that the use of the DSS clearance forms had been less than satisfactory. Many instances were noted where an applicant had stated that he/she was in receipt of a pension/benefit from DSS but that the Department did not advise DSS via the clearance form. The ANAO was advised that no clearance forms were to be forwarded to DSS, and that the onus would be on the applicant to advise DSS that they were in receipt of Abstudy payments.

          The Audit Office is concerned that there has been a move to place the onus on Abstudy recipients to inform DSS that they are in receipt of Abstudy benefits. The ANAO considers that departments have a responsibility to put controls in place to ensure, as far as possible, that beneficiaries do not receive benefits to which they may not be entitled. The Department's present approach does not appear to meet its responsibilities.

It was noted that there was no liaison between the Department and these funding bodies to confirm receipt of income or benefits, and to provide the Department with some assurance that payments were being made only to applicants who were entitled.

I will not speak for more than a minute because I understand we have to get onto the legislation which is diabolically lying before us.

         In the recently released and very well received tax package of the Liberal Party we propose to introduce the means test free component of boarding and second home allowances from $1,500 to $2,400, and we have removed the assets test on the means test free component. As honourable senators will know, something like 3,500 families are affected by this decision, and the Liberal Party is very mindful of the fact that living in an isolated or remote area ought not be a bar to equal and adequate education opportunities.

          Under the present circumstances, with the $1,500 limit, it is just not possible for many families to send their children away and give them a proper education, yet at the same time there is absolutely no opportunity for them to be properly educated if they stay at home. This Government has continuously failed to acknowledge that geographic location ought not be a bar to proper and effective education.

          —In speaking to the motion which Senator Baume has moved, I wish to raise one very small but extremely important aspect of the Auditor-General's Report No. 14 and the issue of assistance for isolated children contained therein. The report refers on page 33 to requirements on parents to provide verification of dependent children by way of birth certificates, although the Department of Employment, Education and Training has indicated that its view is that misrepresentation of the number of dependent children in a family is a low risk area. I wonder whether putting isolated parents and families to the expense of getting birth certificates and so on is appropriate. In the last paragraph of the document there is an indication of some possibility of data matching. But, of course, that also runs into problems with privacy that we have run into in other areas.

          In May 1990, I raised in this Parliament the case of a person living in Port Arthur in Tasmania who appealed against the removal of family allowance when her child reached the age of 16 because she was receiving a boarding allowance for a student child under the assistance for isolated children scheme. I referred that case to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, and asked him whether he had noted that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal had said that, because of the technical interpretation of the then section 81 of the Social Security Act, the appellant's appeal could not be upheld but that her case was—and I am quoting the Appeals Tribunal—`a reasonable case', and that it seemed unreasonable that receipt of AIC `should disqualify receipt of family allowance'.

          I seem to recall that I moved an amendment at that stage, in May 1990, to give effect, as it were, to the views of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Minister indicated to me, and to the whole of the Senate on that occasion, that he, too, regarded the case as reasonable and regarded my amendment to be also reasonable. But he appealed to the Senate and to me not to proceed because the matter would need to be looked at further by the Government. Indeed, subsequently, the Government brought down amending legislation which remedied the problem which had been raised in the first place by my constituent in Port Arthur. The Minister stated clearly that he thought that that person also had a very good case for back payment of family allowance. To give the Minister his due, he had written to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) about the matter.

          The Minister for Finance, on 14 August 1991, replied with a letter which, in short, overrode the information given to me by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson—on which basis I had withdrawn my amndment. That amendment would have been supported there and then because there was support for it from all around the chamber, from the Opposition and the Democrats. But I withdrew it on the basis of that indication from Senator Richardson. I was sure that, given his position in the Cabinet, a payment would be made to this constituent.

I raise this issue now under this heading, and I will continue to raise it in the hope that the Minister will be successful in obtaining approval for payment to this constituent who is entitled, in my view and I think in the Minister's view, to some recognition of the fact that it was her case that pointed out the problem which was subsequently rectified.

         —Yes. In conclusion, I did find it extraordinary that these people, who obviously had huge fun, would actually be silly enough to boast publicly that they, not the Government of the Northern Territory, had set the polling day in the Northern Territory. I point out that, as a conservative estimate, at least 99 per cent of the kind of material that has just been graphically described by its designers, which Senator Sowada and others are describing in pontifical tones as free speech and democracy, not only has nothing to do with free speech but also is positively anti-democratic. I table the article that I was quoting from so that honourable senators can be assured I have quoted from it correctly.

        I point out that the title is probably incorrect in that the term `political broadcasts' will not be relevant to the Bill. As I mentioned in the wee hours of this morning, for the benefit of the Australian Democrats, and as I mention again, on the advice available to me and on my understanding of the constitutional law, the Government will simply be unable to expropriate property by demanding and stealing from the television stations the free time that is required.

         The situation will be that, although the Democrats think they are going to get their talking heads, they will not get anything because the Bill will be tossed out as unconstitutional. The Government knows that. The ALP is aware of that. It is only the Democrats who do not understand that. They will find out to their detriment, in due course, that this Bill will include no provision for political broadcasting at all, not even the alleged free time talking heads material that they expect to get.

         —Yes, but we were going ahead. We do not have to rely on Senator Olsen to enable us to go ahead. I understand that Senator Kernot has problems with the ABC and because of that she wants to have a chat to Senator Bolkus. Rather than putting that off and being able to go through the Bill in the correct and proper fashion, clause by clause, why does Senator Kernot not have a tete-a-tete now and put this Bill off until completion tomorrow? It seems to me a very reasonable request that we ask for an extension of time for the Democrats so that they can have discussions with Senator Bolkus and come to some amicable arrangement. As it is, we do not want our time to be taken up on our amendments while the Democrats and the Government are chatting.

Having considered that, we would go on to clause 6, on which I anticipate there will be a lot of debate. During that debate I would have a chance to talk with the Australian Democrats. The process of the Senate will not be held up because of that. Secondly, in the spirit in which Senator Parer suggested we deal with amendments cognately to deal with issues rather than specific provisions to be amended, the first Democrat amendment falls within a batch of amendments from the Democrats which could all be considered together after we consider clause 6.

This legislation brings the ABC under the umbrella of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The ABC would prefer to cooperate with the concept of roadblocking but, instead of having the ABC under the umbrella of the Tribunal along with the commercial television networks and the Special Broadcasting Service, it would prefer us to create three separate entities—the Tribunal, the Corporation and the Service.

         A few minutes ago the ABC advised me—and Senator Schacht too, I believe—that it is prepared to accept what was the obstacle in this process, the final arbiter's point, when somebody has to decide who gets the last 10 per cent of free time. It was felt to be totally inappropriate to have three separate arbiters, maybe tossing three separate coins. It was totally impractical for the ABC to be left out of that. The ABC—and I believe I am representing its concern for its integrity—is very happy to accept being a part of the Tribunal's final arbitration system on the matter of the last 10 per cent for minority parties. That is the only change I would need to make to the amendments in front of the Minister.

If the ABC is prepared to accept the Tribunal to the extent that it indicates it is, it is not much further to accept what has been proposed by the Government. I could go into a long contribution about the ABC and its role in respect of the ABT, but I indicate at this stage that we will not be supporting the measure that has been flagged by Senator Kernot. If we do go into a longer debate, I will go into the reasons more extensively. By accepting some involvement by the ABT, it would not need much more to accept the involvement reflected in this Bill, of course on a without prejudice basis, in that we would not see this as a precedent for any future legislation in respect of the ABC.

Their concern is that this is the foot in the door for a basic change, and that the ABT will become the regulatory body for program standards for the whole of the ABC.

         I indicated many months ago, as a member of the Caucus broadcasting subcommittee, that I am opposed to the ABC coming under the auspices of the ABT as far as programming is concerned. But I cannot see how this Bill can work effectively on allocation of free time with ABC and commercial television stations, particularly on the concept of blocking across the ABC station and the three commercial stations in capital cities, without having one body to decide who is going to have the 7.30 spot for two minutes or the 9.30 spot for two minutes. There must be one body doing it, and I think the best body is the ABT. But I want to put it on the record that I do not support that being the foot in the door for the ABC to come under the auspices of the ABT for general program standards and program content.

         —I speak briefly in support of my colleague Senator Parer. In many ways, I find the way the Government deals with radio to be the most astonishing part of this process that it is attempting to implement in law. The logic whereby one can have free time provided for television and not for radio simply escapes me. I simply cannot see why it would be supplied for one and not for the other.

         The second problem I have is that, if one accepts the argument, which I understand is promoted by some, that in some ways television advertising can be unreasonably emotive and unreasonably convincing and that is why one has to apply a special regime for television, then I do not think anyone argues that those same principles apply to radio. I have not heard anyone say that radio advertising in some ways is unfairly persuasive. If it is not unfairly persuasive, why are we concerned to prohibit advertising on radio?

         The only argument to that would be that it is too expensive. But, as I understand it, radio advertising is actually quite moderately priced. It is certainly very moderately priced in relation to TV. There have been times in my life when I have been responsible for booking blocks of radio advertisements and, compared with booking blocks of TV advertisements, it costs almost nothing.

         Not only is it moderately priced in relation to television, but also it is not particularly expensive in relation to print media which is allowed, of course, by this legislation. So it does not seem to me that the argument that is put against radio advertisements is that it is unfairly expensive, otherwise print media would be cut out as well.

         The argument does not seem to be that it is unfairly emotive. So I cannot understand the argument to treat radio this way. That is why Senator Parer has moved this amendment. Our starting point is that the whole Bill is a fundamental breach of freedom of speech, but it seems to us particularly illogical in the way it deals with radio. We believe that the community should be entitled to take out radio advertisements and to pay for them during a period of elections. Therefore, we have moved to delete these provisions so that that fundamental right that has existed for Australians in the past will be able to continue.

I will not say from time immemorial but certainly over years far beyond the years we have had television, people have been able to have their viewpoints expressed by paid advertisements over the broadcasting stations. It has been said by Senator Hill—I will not rehearse all the points made by him—that it is a relatively cheap way of getting a message across.

         —Senator Harradine, who was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters with me in a previous Parliament, must remember the evidence given by the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters. FARB made a couple of very interesting points. In principle it argued against any ban but, if there was to be a ban, it was absolutely opposed to free time on radio even more than television because of the very diverse nature of commercial radio and the awkwardness of fitting in with program arrangements. Once the Federation got past its objections to the principle of the ban as far as the workings of providing free time were concerned, from my recollection of the evidence it was totally opposed to free time. I think that is part of the response of the Government here today.

         I also want to point out that with radio we are dealing, as I say, with a much more diverse system of programs. Radio stations have specialised programming. We also have to deal with the major markets, and there are a couple of dozen commercial radio stations in the greater metropolitan Sydney or Melbourne markets. It is not as cheap as some people think for radio spot ads in the major markets. If we went to a top radio station in Sydney or Melbourne to place a 30-second advertisement, we would be paying $500, $600 or $700 each time.

But when one wants to buy a package of 30 or 40 ads on several of these stations at one time at $600 or $700 a pop, one suddenly runs up tens of thousands of dollars per day. The evidence before the Select Committee from the Broadcasting Tribunal showed that the increases in radio advertising costs were similar to those for television advertising. That certainly justifies the ban on paid advertising on radio being treated the same as television advertising.

Senator Schacht and I may differ on the issue of free time and paid time in radio, but all the evidence before the Committee fully endorsed, I believe, the comments Senator Schacht made to the chamber that radio was a very important means of communication, particularly in election periods. Radio is important for people to be able to get messages across not only to the groups he mentioned but particularly to rural communities as well, which were excluded from the comments by Senator Schacht. I have to say that incomprehensibly and with no explanation the recommendation in the Schacht report to include radio was dropped out of the Bill. I am not sure why that was the case. Senator Schacht has not explained it to us; nor has the Minister.

If one wants to get a message to the widest number of people in the quickest time, radio is the way to go. So Senator Schacht is not correct in saying that radio is very expensive. In terms of the people reached, he would have to concede that radio is by far the cheapest form of electioneering.

        This is a similar amendment which would have a similar effect in respect of television. If this amendment were passed, I think that Senator Bolkus said that the Bill would be finished, and he is absolutely correct. It would mean that there would be no requirement on television stations to provide free time to political parties during election campaigns, and all television stations would be available at any time of the year to take advertisements from anyone, whether on a political or any other matter. To put it simply, I understand that neither the Government nor the Democrats will support this amendment.

We have had legal advice to indicate that the definition is sustainable. If Senator Macdonald were to look at definitions of charitable organisations as they have been defined, he would see that the courts have had a long history of defining what may or may not be a charitable organisation.

         —I understand the point Senator Walters is making is that a person, such as myself or herself, who is not print handicapped, could listen to the program. That is allowed, but the programming style, explained to us by the witnesses who run these programs, is done in a very balanced way. It is already operating that way. The station management and the organising committee at the station go to great lengths to ensure that the material which is read out from newspapers and magazines over the radio is balanced. There have been no complaints in the past about imbalance. I imagine that they will continue successfully with that programming in the future. If Senator Walters or I happen to listen to that station, I am sure we will listen to a balanced presentation—a reading of what may be the contents of the newspapers that day, including various advertisements. It will be done in a way that is balanced between all the political parties, as it has been operating in recent elections.

Without repeating Senator Schacht's remarks, I mention the Senate Select Committee, but I also refer Senator Walters to the Broadcasting Act, particularly subsections 119AB (1) and (2). It is worth reading those out in respect of the licences that we are talking about for the visually handicapped. Subsection (1) provides:

        There is already a fair degree of control exercised over these licences.

         Senator Campbell asked a question about the definition of `public health matter'. The only answer I can give is in line with the answer I gave Senator Macdonald earlier on. Any interpretation of the Bill and definitions within it must, of course, finally go to the court system. The provision itself is very clear. The intention is to allow the promotion of public health matters, whether they be the eradication of diseases or other similar health problems that prevail in society, without canvassing a political health issue related to a particular health system. I do put in the word `political' in relation to the canvassing of a particular health system and, to that extent, a court would make an interpretation on whether the advertisement that Senator Campbell mentioned came within that definition. It is very hard for me from here to know what he has been watching on television from Western Australia, particularly if the honourable senator has been over here the last few days and the advertisement has been playing in Western Australia during that period. However, the intention is to allow the canvassing of public health issues but, at the same time, have some control over political issues which may come within that broad parameter.

         —Perhaps I could be a little more specific. When this legislation comes into effect, we will be looking at a real world situation where the Health Benefits Fund runs an advertisement—I am sure there are similar advertisements around Australia—which says, `Medicare will not cover dental work, physiotherapy or occupational therapy. You should take out HBF'. I ask the Minister: will that sort of advertisement be banned under this legislation because it says that Medicare is no good because it does not do this? The advertisement is obviously not specifically political, but someone who is afraid of Medicare being criticised, such as the Minister, could interpret it that way, as could the Electoral Commission.

         Would an injunction be sought by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal or the Electoral Commission to stop that advertisement going to air? If an election were called in four weeks time, would that advertisement be stopped by way of injunction? What sort of certainty can we give these private sector companies which, in good faith, put a lot of money into preparing these advertisements? In a roundabout way, the advertisements specifically criticise the public health system by saying, `The public health system does not give you this, but the private sector can. Take out some insurance with the private sector'. I think the Minister is duty bound to inform the Committee and the people of Australia what this clause means. Otherwise, as Senator Macdonald says, it will be a lawyers' paradise. If the Minister cannot inform the Senate what this specifically means, how is the rest of Australia meant to know?

This particular provision makes an exemption for the promotion of specific health matters. I have not seen the advertisement to which Senator Campbell refers. Clearly, political advertisements during an election campaign are not allowed to go on. If an organisation, for instance, runs a campaign for a better diet, a campaign against AIDS or a whole range of other areas that go to the issue of public health, that is not political.

If that is the case, why does the Government not exempt organisations whose area of concern is to support programs for the alleviation of disease and poverty internationally? That would seem to me to be logical. If the Government is exempting the area of public health, those organisations should also be exempted—perhaps they are already exempt. `Public health' is not defined specifically as the public health of Australians.

         It is up to the courts to interpret but I refer Senator Harradine to subsection (b) of the definition of a public health matter, which makes it clear that advertisements which would advocate voting for or against a candidate or a political party in an election would not fall within the exemption. In that respect, one would make a determination of the particular advertisements. If a particular candidate, for instance, was tied very strongly, or seen to be tied, to a particular issue, it would be very much up to the court to make an assessment as to whether the link was strong enough to ensure that the exemption would not prevail.

         —I want to support the amendment to change `charitable organisation' to `exempt organisation'. One of the fundamental problems with this Bill and the use of the words `charitable organisation' is that the definition is restricted to those organisations where there is a benefit to the public through relief of poverty, advancement of education, religion, public health and science. It is a value judgment that only these sorts of organisations should be exempt. There are many other organisations in our society which should also be exempt from this—professional organisations, industry organisations, chambers of commerce and public interest groups.

         Broadly speaking, private sector organisations and enterprises may not seek to relieve poverty through charity but seek to create public good through enterprise, development and the creation of jobs. From time to time they bring important public issues before the public. Many of those public issues need not be political by nature. I would ask the Democrats to consider seriously whether or not applying a political ban to these sorts of organisations is something that they could even contemplate in a modern Western democracy. I plead with them to consider very carefully allowing these organisations to come into this exempt category so that they can advocate the advancement of their causes—be it an industry, professions or chambers of commerce—without clearly putting forward a political message. I seek the support of the Democrats and the Government for what I think is a sensible amendment to this legislation.

         In relation to Senator Parer's quite legitimate assertion on amendment No. 4, as proposed by the Opposition, the Government has chosen the word `explicitly' for good reasons. I think honourable senators would understand that there was a campaign based on the charitable organisations at the time the Bill was first tabled. A very valid and strong point made by them was that they wanted to pursue social issues, whether issues of poverty or whatever. Because of that, we have limited our amendment No. 10 to paragraph 95A(3)(b) to explicit advertisements advocating a particular result in an election, as opposed to a more general prohibition which would have meant that advertisements run by the charitable, public and the like organisations would not have been allowed to canvass issues which were very close to those organisations.

It concerns the prevention of organisations, such as unions, from responding to what might be contained in a policy speech. To give an example—the chamber should bear in mind that we are talking down the track for State governments, ultimately—a particular government in its policy speech announces that it will, if elected, extend trading into Sundays. If legislation such as this were operating in that State, it would prevent the unions which have members in shops, or indeed the small retailers, from putting their points of view by way of advertisement over the electronic media. This would be so, despite the fact that the political party would have free time on the television for its policy launch and despite the fact that the talking heads of that particular political party could constantly repeat their reasons for advancing this policy of extending trading into Sundays, which would vitally affect the unions with members in particular shops and vitally affect small shopkeepers.

         —In order not to delay the Committee too much, as I did spend some time on this matter in my contribution in the second reading debate, I will speak briefly. I think it is quite appalling that this Government, which is noted for its centralism—of course, the Democrats have also been noted for their centralism over the years—has total disregard for the Federal system and the benefits of a Federal system. I reiterate very briefly what I have suggested to the Senate: if we create one electoral system for the whole of Australia and that electoral system is a mistake, we end up with one big disaster. It is a lot better to have a little disaster here and there in the States and allow a bit of experimentation.

I am glad to have had the support of Senator Hill, Senator Parer, Senator Walters and other honourable senators in the chamber tonight, but clearly this matter could have been dealt with in relation to Commonwealth elections alone.

         Of course, this is another excuse for this centralist socialist Government to grab more power from the States. The Senate was designed by the founding fathers to stop that centralist trend. This Government and the Labor Party are committed to that centralism. This part of the Bill is just another part of an ongoing and very unfortunate trend in Australian politics, which I will certainly seek to reverse during my time in this place.

If the Government is pursuing this matter, let it be for Federal Parliament alone and not interfere with the rights of States, State parliaments or State electors.

         —I underestimated his pulling power in Tasmania. On the States rights issue raised by Senator Harradine—other honourable senators opposite may have raised it while I was out of the chamber—the High Court has upheld on a number of occasions that the operation of the Broadcasting and Television Act is a matter within the constitutional power of the Federal Government.

         When we banned outright cigarette advertising on television and radio, we did it by amending the Broadcasting and Television Act; we did not do it by asking each State to pass a motion or an amendment to a mythical Act in their own State parliament, because they clearly do not have constitutional responsibility for television and broadcasting. Senator Harradine can say, quite correctly, that we intervened and stopped people advertising on television and radio stations in each of the States in which they are geographically located. We did stop them broadcasting in 1976. I think the legislation was introduced by the Whitlam Government and finally put through in 1976 by the Fraser Government, but I may be out by a year or so.

         Quite clearly, the national Parliament decided to exercise its powers on an Act that it clearly has constitutional power over; that is, the Broadcasting and Television Act. I think it is quite appropriate that we make a national judgment about that Act and about introducing amendments for good public order. A State parliament about to introduce an individual Act to deal with a constitutional matter which it has clear-cut control over—for example, to amend the Education Act in regard to educational services to vary State aid funding to private schools—would not wait until the Federal Government carried legislation to say it could or could not do something or advised it on which way to do it. State governments accept that as their constitutional power. Some honourable senators may disagree that the States should have that power, but they do have it and they exercise it without seeking the view of the Federal Parliament.

         On many occasions there is now cooperative legislation, such as the establishment last year of the Australian Securities Commission. That was done by cooperative legislation among all State parliaments and federally to establish a decent Australian Securities Commission which would establish standards properly operating to control, monitor and regulate the Australian securities industry. In that area the constitutionality of what we were doing was a mixture of both State and Federal responsibility and, therefore, cooperative legislation was needed.

         I believe that the argument being raised by Senator Macdonald is about the allocation of free time as it would apply in Queensland and where there are two opposition parties. The Queensland example raised by Senator Macdonald is where at the moment the two opposition parties have approximately the same percentage vote, give or take 5 per cent or so. The official Opposition is the National Party, which has a lot more seats than the Liberal Party. So in terms of seats, the formula we have before us is quite relevant. However, I think Senator Macdonald's argument is that the percentage vote is much closer and that, therefore, the official Opposition gets an advantage of much more free time to perhaps maintain the status quo of it being the larger opposition party.

         Senator Macdonald's point is that that sort of mechanism is not adequately reflected by the wording of 95DD(1)(b). Whereas in subclause (3) we accommodate more than one party; Senator Macdonald's point is that (b) may not. Under the Acts Interpretation Act the word `party' in (b) can be taken to mean parties. But I take the point, and I suggest to the Committee that I move another set of words—and they are very easy to follow if one looks at the existing (b)—to go in (b) and those words would be:

         The formula that has been picked up is the one that has been universally applied by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation over quite a number of years to govern elections.

         If that is what it says in Queensland, why does that not apply in this chamber, because there are three parties here who comprise the non-government party? That is what the Minister is saying `opposition' means. So by that skilful bit of drafting on the run, the Minister has now given the Democrats a share of our 40 per cent. The Government has 40 per cent. So between the Liberals, the Nationals and the Democrats, we now share 40 per cent. The 10 per cent for the third party goes I do not know where.

The Minister must understand that there is an official Opposition in Queensland, which is the National Party; there is a third party, which is the Liberal Party and he is lumping them together in his proposed amendment in subclause (b) by saying they are the political parties that comprise the opposition. So the Minister is really including all political parties that comprise the non-government party. If it applies in Queensland, why does it not apply in this chamber? I hope the Democrats realise that I think they have now just joined in a third of the 40 per cent rather than the 10 per cent or the half of the 10 per cent which they thought they had. How is my arithmetic? They will be better off. They will probably support the Minister on that.

         We confirm that today we met with Sir Maurice Byers Q.C., former Solicitor General for the Commonwealth, to discuss with him proposed amendments to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The amendments discussed with Sir Maurice related to proposals to amend the Broadcasting Act 1942 by modifying the proposed moratorium on the broadcast of political advertising and providing for a system of freetime election broadcasts. Under proposed Section 95DK of the Broadcasting Act, broadcasters will be compelled to allocate units of freetime (an undefined term) for the purposes of making election broadcasts during the relevant election period for the person to whom time has been granted. Under proposed Clause 95DK(5), a broadcaster is required to make that election broadcast free of charge.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Proposed Section 95DK(7) provides that licensees required to make election broadcasts have an entitlement to such additional broadcasting time to broadcast other material (including advertisements and station promotions) as is determined by the regulations.

         In summary, Sir Maurice Byers views were as follows:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (a)Section 95DK is invalid because it is inconsistent with the protective guarantee of just terms in Section 51(31) of the Constitution.

         (b)Even if the law could be categorised as being one with respect to the power granted by Section 51(5) of the Constitution (that is, a law with respect to "postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other like services") it would be invalid because "the effect of the purpose of paragraph (31) with its requirement for `just terms', in Section 51 is that other heads of power, including the incidental power" do not authorise legislation for the acquisition of property:  the

         (c)Commercial television licensees have the right to sell time, without restriction, during a 24 hour day and that right is property for the purposes of Section 51(31) of the Constitution.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (d)The question whether just terms had been provided would turn on whether an allowance of extra advertising or promotional time per hour was practicable:  if it was not practicable then the acquisition would be unfair. If the acquisition was unfair then it would not be on "just terms".

         In addition, Sir Maurice expressed the preliminary view that the Bill as a whole is inconsistent with the system of responsible Government envisaged by the Constitution, in particular, the free flow of information to electors. In his view, any law regulating elections that may have the effect of restricting the electorate's access to information may be unconstitutional.

         —If the Minister is not prepared to acknowledge it he is not being honest. There is clearly a serious deficiency and it will take more attention. We do not have the amendment in writing. It will take detailed consideration in itself, and the consequences are very significant. It comes out of the fact that the Government has decided to apply this regime to the States and then to political parties within State elections, and unless it is done properly it will end up in a foul mess. That seems to be obvious. That is not being unpleasant or anything—that is just obvious. It will not be resolved without completing the rest of the Bill by 7.30, in an hour's time.

         I want to indicate at this time that I will be seeking to extend the gag so that this matter today can be dealt with reasonably. I think everyone would agree that the debate has been progressing sensibly. There has been just about no abuse—perhaps one slight abuse—around the chamber of the time constraints in an effort to comply with the requirements. Therefore I want to give that indication now that I will be seeking an extension of time to complete the Bill. I would therefore ask for some indication as to whether the Government and/or the Democrats will support what I intend to do.

As I said, I think history demonstrates that when the legislative process works on that basis a great deal of unfortunate consequence follows and there are further amendments.

         I think that clause 6 should be looked at overnight. I do not think the Minister should put his own advisers under the pressure that will result in problems in the outcome. The advisers should be able to take it away and carefully consider the matter and, with respect, they ought to have a talk with Senator Macdonald about some of the factual situations in Queensland and with Senator Harradine about some of the factual situations in Tasmania. It does seem on the face of the matter that the advisers operated purely from theory without taking into account what is on the ground at all. I guess when we start looking at other States we will find unique situations as well.

         When I mentioned the Australian Democrats, I did not refer to the last election, at which I think Senator Bell increased substantially the Democrats' vote. In any event, he was elected. I did refer to the last time I stood, which was five years ago. It is fair in a situation such as that to remember two things: the parties that were elected and the percentage of votes gained. But in realistic and just terms how does one consider and fit my situation into the third aspect—the guaranteed 10 per cent? I refer not particularly to my situation but to the situation of my voters. I would be happy to have discussions with the Minister about that.

Where do they sit? Does that mean that the Greens get their proportion out of the 40 per cent Government vote leaving in this instance—and I hope Senator Bell and Senator Harradine are listening to this—the Labor Party with three-quarters of the 40 per cent, the Greens with a quarter of the 40 per cent, the Liberals with the full 40 per cent of the Opposition and no-one sharing the 10 per cent of the third party? There is not really a third party. I think the third party, the Greens, is part of the Government, but I am not quite sure of the situation in Tasmania.

        What that means—and the Opposition has taken a consistent view on this—is that it is an anathema to continue with public funding of political parties. Contributions to political parties should be of a voluntary nature and the taxpayer should not be compelled by legislation to contribute to a party that he or she may not even approve of. This amendment is related to an amendment to be moved later.

         —A very important point was made in last night's debate because of the press release by Professor Goldsworthy. I would like to put on the record that the Democrats said in April this year that they would not support an increase in Senate funding. It is very important to us that we have that date on the record, because there is no reason for anybody to keep repeating in this debate on this Bill that we are being bought off by a $500,000 increase in public funding for the Senate. I would like to put on the record our view that the values of the Senate vote and the House of Representatives vote, as they currently stand, should be pooled and divided so that the House of Representatives vote would go down and ours would rise slightly. The average of that pool would cost the public purse no more.

        The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that those parties which would be excluded from putting in a return for a particular financial year in respect of contributions to a political party or a branch of a party should be in legislation and not in regulation. My understanding is that in the other place it was the so-called Kerin amendment, if I am correct, that changed this to a matter of regulation rather than legislation. The Opposition has a lot of concerns about that.

         The Opposition is also concerned about the fact that the point relating to the amount of money above which a disclosure had to be made has been removed. Whereas previously it had been $1,000, the Government itself recommended, about 12 months ago, that the figure be $1,500. Then, Mr Chairman, it disappeared altogether. So our recommendation is that this clause be amended so that it brings back the regulations in regard to organisations and nominates the amount above which disclosure has to be made as $1,500.

         —Mr Chairman, in responding to this I will go through a little history. It was initially the Government's intention to have a minimum benchmark under which contributions would not be disclosable. But we considered that and we also considered whether we should just have a blanket compulsion on disclosure. The problem we confronted was that we needed to provide flexibility. The only way that we felt we could do that was to provide for regulation making exclusions from the blanket disclosure provision. Those provisions—-

         —I will explain that in a second. The reason why the Government felt that was so was that there are a number of things that parties do and expend moneys on that they really would not want to have included in an overall package of disclosure; for instance, buying pencils, rubbers and other stationery is one level. One could say that could be accommodated by a benchmark.

         The other problem we found was—and this was a problem that actually generated a lot of heat in Victoria—that it was felt that with a blanket disclosure provision parties would have to disclose all subscriptions, donations, gifts, et cetera to them, and in the process would have to disclose the membership lists of those organisations because they would be a contribution to the party. Those have been the two motivating concerns in respect to providing for exemption from disclosure. The regulation, as it is intended, will cover only those two types of areas. As I say, those regulations would be disallowable by this place. But it was very much born out of a concern that if one had a blanket provision then one would compel all contributors' names to be disclosed and, in that respect, membership names would be disclosed.

         The question which I suppose may be asked is: if one has an exemption level of, say, $1,500, does that not cater for the membership and the minor expenditure and income arrangements?  The answer is that it does but only to a certain extent. The concern was that one could very well start up a $5,000 club or a $10,000 club or a $1,501 club which could be seen to be given special membership. It might be, as Senate Olsen and I would know in respect of our football club back in Adelaide, that one could have a membership of a special class who pay a certain amount of money, whether it be $1,000 or whatever.

         But there is a concern that by, for instance, just excluding membership fees by legislation there could be rorts on the definition of the term `membership fee', and membership of parts of an organisation could be dependent on the payment of a large amount of money. Therefore, we have not chosen to exclude by legislation membership fees, which is one of the motivating factors towards having this regulatory provision. Nor have we chosen to put a benchmark as hard as the $1,500 which is included in Senator Parer's amendment.

         As I say, our intention is to ensure, firstly, that those extremely minor amounts of money do not have to be disclosed and, secondly, that membership, bona fide or otherwise, is tackled to the extent that bona fide memberships are non-disclosable to the extent of the name of the person who is a member, but non-bona fide memberships are disclosable. In terms of bona fide memberships, a party would have to disclose the cumulative figure of membership. There is no debate about that. The other thing about this particular point is that the regulations would have to come back here and they would not operate in this instance, in respect of the disclosure provisions of the Act, unless the last date allowable for their disallowance had expired.

         The motivation is very much to make the provisions work to that extent. That is why the Government has chosen to give some regulatory power. As I say—I know Senator Kemp is looking at me inquisitively—the exercise of that power would be very much under the control of either House of Parliament.

         In the early part of the Minister's comments he mentioned clubs which may be $5,000 clubs or even $10,000 clubs. Is the Minister saying that if we had those types of clubs they would be included or excluded under the regulations which the Government is contemplating?

         —What I am saying is that those sorts of clubs would be included. Donations to those sorts of clubs would be disclosable as donations to the organisation that those particular clubs are either part of or channel money through. The club would become a third party. The intention is not to allow a mechanism through which the intention of the Act would be applied. The distinction I was making was between bona fide party membership and the artificial structure of gilt-edged clubs around a party organisation. In the latter case one would want them disclosed but in the former one would not. That is why the flexibility has been provided for.

         —I tried to go through the processes of explaining this. The reason we did not choose a figure of $1,500 was in recognition of the fact that quite often one might not have donations of less than $1,500 that one would want to disclose. Keeping that in mind, quite often there are donations of less than $1,500 that one may not want to disclose because they relate to the purchase of paper or whatever. That is why we have not gone for a hard and fast number.

         The other thing I asked the Committee to keep in mind was the fact that we are, in this package, introducing the capacity in the Electoral Commission for spot audit. To the extent that any organisation tries to avoid the disclosure provisions, the Electoral Commission would have the capacity to comprehensively spot audit a registered political party or a third party organisation. As a consequence, we are quite confident that, with those spot audit powers and the extent of those powers, any evasive action would be tagged by the Commission.

         Basically what this does, as I said earlier, is provide some degree of flexibility in making the section operable in a way that does not mean that, on the one hand, a bona fide organisation has to disclose stuff that we do not need and, on the other hand, the Electoral Commission is preoccupied with vetting accounts that it otherwise would not vet. The basic point is that those regulations that determine what is and what is not would come to the Parliament and would be disallowable.

         —I emphasise the point that we are talking about contributions or payments of $1,500 by a particular political party. If a political party buys typewriter ribbons, pencils or whatever, obviously it does not have to disclose that payment to the Commission because it is under the set amount. Likewise, in the area revenue and receipt of contributions, if a party received membership fees under the set figure of $1,500, it would not be obliged to provide the membership list. So I put to the Committee that the view of the Minister that this legislation would require membership lists to be placed before us is an absolute furphy. The Government has set the figure at $1,500 and the amounts below that therefore do not form part of the list and rightfully so.

         A range of expenditure items of major political parties has been identified. It is logical and sensible to note that one would not want a detailed list of, for example, the number of pencils and pens that a political party buys. The other point to be made in refuting what the Minister had to say and supporting the amendment is that surely we, on a matter of this importance, ought to be incorporating in legislation what those amounts ought to be so that any political party or government in the future would have to reintroduce legislation to the Parliament if it wanted to alter the figures. That is a very important point in my view. We are dealing with legislation which will operate in the future. It is the province of the Parliament, not the province of Executive Council, to do this. I think that very important principle ought to be embodied in this legislation.

         There are two other problems that we have with the Opposition's proposal. The Opposition has put in line two of proposed section 311A(1) a requirement that a return be furnished within four weeks after the end of each financial year. I think it is very strongly felt that the eight week period that we have in our legislation is more appropriate. It gives the organisations involved a degree of time which may be necessary.

As I say, there are some enormous penalties here. Under the Constitution, a person who breaches some of these penalties would be denied the ability ever to stand for parliament. I think it is important to have that eight week period.

They could refer to either a State branch or an individual sub-branch, wherever it might be—whether it is in Ceduna or Townsville or wherever. I think there is no need to have that sort of specificity in the provision. First, the term `political party' encompasses the broad structure of the party.

That would give us a pressure valve to ensure that there was no unexpected getting around the Act. I think that is a framework that encompasses both our proposal and the Opposition proposal. It probably would be satisfactory to the Democrats and it probably would not be all that hard to find words to reflect it.

        Nothing in subsection (1) requires particulars of a person or organisation who made a contribution to a registered political party or a State branch of a registered political party in a financial year to be included in a return if the value of the contributions, or the total value of all of the contributions, as the case may be, is less than $1,500.

        That means that if the value is greater than $1,500 over a given year a payment would have to be included, so it would clean up the possibility—I think this is what the Minister might be referring to—of donations of $900 or $1,100, being less than $1,500, being excluded. I think that is covered most adequately.

         The provision of an audit trail within the legislation does not mean, I would imagine, that, because someone does not notify a contribution under $1,500, when the auditor goes down the track, looking at political parties or third parties, he would not follow amounts of money less than $1,500 to make sure that someone was not playing some sort of a game.

         Within the same amendment is another part that is very important to the Opposition. It is something that we have highlighted time and time again. It is the concern that we have with disclosure, or the giving of donations, with regard to discrimination not only towards a person by a hostile government or third party after a donation has been made, but also with regard to coercion that may well occur to force a donation from a reluctant donor.

          The penalty for offences is quite deliberately set at $5,000 for an individual or imprisonment for two years or both. If an offender is a body corporate, a fine of $20,000 would be applied. We also provide that a person who suffers loss or damage by action or conduct of another person in contravention of this subsection—in other words, subject to discrimination—may recover the amount lost by action against that other person in a court of competent jurisdiction.

         The advice I have from the Electoral Commission is that clause 16 of the Bill already picks up subclauses (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f). We feel that we have accommodated those provisions within our proposed Bill.

         With respect to subclause (d), there are a couple of problems. I am not sure that the Opposition has done this intentionally—I hope not. First of all, there is reference to a `statement'. The rest of the Act refers to `returns' and, to be consistent, we want to maintain that particular term. That is one problem.

         Our Bill ensures that offences under Division 5A are incorporated into the rest of the penalty provisions by section 315(3) which is in clause 16. The direct impact of that, without going through all the technicalities, is that the penalties for the sorts of offences in subclause (d) under our proposal are $10 000, not $5,000, which is twice as much. I hope that this has not been done deliberately, and I will not even contemplate that. I am sure that, given the complexities of this particular part of the legislation, it has not. That is the first point. In respect of subclause 11, the penalties (e) and (f), we have penalties in the Act already which provide for $1,000.

        (1) Under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations, certain benefits must generally be preserved until a member has attained 55 years of age and has retired from employment. Subject to the conditions of the relevant trust deed, such benefits may be paid out earlier than retirement on or after age 55 in the event of the member's death, permanent incapacity for work, permanent departure from Australia or in such other circumstances as the Commissioner considers appropriate.

        When the ISC was established and took over some of the superannuation functions of the Taxation Office, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner took the view that related Taxation Rulings should continue to apply until such time as they were reviewed and amended by the ISC. One such ruling was IT2335.

        These provisions are similar to those previously in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Tax Act). To enable consistent consideration of ``other circumstances'' for the early release of preserved benefits, the Commissioner of Taxation provided guidance in the form of ruling IT2335.

        With the relocation of the former Tax Act provisions into the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations, effective from 1 July 1990, it was necessary to review those rulings as to their continued applicability. As a result of this review, and to encompass changing circumstances and legislation, the ISC is currently developing new guidelines for the early release of superannuation benefits which are preserved under the Occupational Superannuation Standards.

        The US reduction of the global sugar tariff quota is an extremely disappointing development for Australia especially as it comes on top of restraints placed on Australian meat exports to the US and the US-EC grain subsidy war.

        The sugar industry is not alone amongst rural industries in experiencing the effects of depressed international prices and also the effects of the current drought.  The current rural downturn is being caused largely by overproduction in world agricultural markets, combined with the effects of export subsidies and other protection arrangements in a number of countries, notably the EC, the USA and Japan. The Australian Government is committed to improving the international trading environment and will persist in efforts in the Uruguay Round of GATT Trade Negotiations, and through other opportunities, to achieve enduring and beneficial reform.

Key components of the Budget include revised eligibility rules for Family Allowance Supplements, assistance through AUSTUDY and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, and increased funding for the Rural Counselling Program.  Two new schemes, the Business Advisers for Rural Areas (BARA) Scheme and the Rural Industries Business Extension Service (RIBES) have been introduced to assist in the economic development of rural areas.

        Given that Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) routinely make use of a number of financial management risk or hedging transactions to minimise their exposure to adverse variations in futures prices, and that Australian Financial institutions are no longer happy to enter into agreements with GBEs until a statutory power is given, has consideration been given to the need for Australian Defence Industries, AeroSpace Technologies of Australia and the Defence Housing Authority, to have clauses inserted into their legislation (as is the case with the Australian National Railways Commission) ensuring that they have the powers to enter into a number of financial management risk or hedging transactions.

        As far as the Defence Housing Authority is concerned, the enabling legislation empowers the Authority to borrow funds from the Commonwealth; and with the approval of the Treasurer, to borrow funds from other than the Commonwealth or to raise money otherwise than by borrowing, by dealing in securities, and to perform its function in accordance with sound commercial practice. This power is considered sufficient to cover hedging and similar transactions.

Implementation of these regulations has been tightened to approve full-time duty for Army Reservists only in circumstances where there is an operational requirement. This implementation allows Army Reservists to be employed in the most important areas within budgetary guidance.

        (1) The mandatory labelling of foodstuffs sold in Australia is a State and Territory responsibility.  I understand that most States and Territories have adopted the Australian Food Standards Code, which is now the responsibility of the National Food Authority.  The labelling of export foodstuffs is controlled by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service under the Export Control Act 1982.

        Internationally, the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission has established a general standard for the labelling of food and that standard states that when a food undergoes processing which changes its nature in a second country, the country in which the processing is performed shall be considered to be the country of origin.

        The Export Control Act 1982, and I understand the various State and Territory food laws, stipulate that unless foods undergo some form of treatment which alters their basic nature, they cannot be labelled as being of Australian origin.  This follows the international convention.

        The Pierpont article in the Bulletin of 5 November 1991 specifically refers to fruit juice and I am informed that most States and Territories have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, a provision requiring the use of imported juice to be declared on the label.

        (2) Foodstuffs imported into Australia have to meet the standards set by the States and Territories in their food laws.  These laws generally reflect the provisions in the Australian Food Standards Code and it is the Code that is used in assessing imports where necessary.  I am confident that these standards provide adequate protection to consumers.

        As recognised in the Pierpont article Australia, as an exporting country, has to meet the demands of its customers.  Under those circumstances there may be differences in the standards.  From a quarantine perspective, Australian import standards are amongst the most stringent in the world.

        The Pierpont article does not distinguish between the role of Customs and the food inspection role of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).  AQIS is responsible for the inspection and certification of most export food products and the majority of meat produced for domestic consumption.  AQIS also administers the imported food inspection program which is based on a risk assessment of the public health dangers of the food in question against the Australian Food Standards Code.  Additionally, AQIS inspects plant and animal products for export and import  for quarantine purposes.  To undertake these tasks AQIS has a staff of some 1788 inspectors plus some 700 State and Territory employees who work under contract to AQIS. The article also fails to recognise the number of State and Territory employees who are involved in the enforcement of domestic food laws.
