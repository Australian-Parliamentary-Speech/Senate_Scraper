       Air Landing Fee: New South Wales

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.

        AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, this Bill proposes amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 to provide for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reporting of international telegraphic transfers will complement the existing requirements under the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 for cash dealers to report to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (CTRA) those transactions which are either suspect or involve cash in excess of $10,000 and for individuals to report the export and import of currency in excess of $5,000. The existing reporting system fills a gap left by the removal of a system of tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls which ceased to operate from 1 July 1990. The successes of the CTRA, as described in its recently tabled Annual Report have been impressive. The degree of effectiveness of the agency, still in its infancy, reflects the enormous good-will and cooperation of the financial sector in assisting law enforcement, and the growing expertise of our revenue and law enforcement agencies in dealing with the financial aspects of illegal activity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This measure now proposed will assist in combating large scale tax evasion and organised crime. The trend in tax evasion and corporate crime is to internationalise illicit profits, and international telegraphic transfers are the principal means by which funds are channelled from Australia overseas. The reporting of the data to the CTRA will allow the easy collection, analysis and immediate dissemination to law enforcement agencies of accurate information relating to international telegraphic transfers of funds.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In March 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial and Public Administration (Martin Committee) in considering the issue of international profit shifting found evidence of the perpetration of large scale revenue evasion, possibly of the order of $100-250 million, and recommended that a system of monitoring and reporting international telegraphic transfers of funds be implemented, with the CTRA responsible for the establishment and administration of such a system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Martin Committee has indicated that the capture and analysis of telegraphic transfer data would add a significant dimension to the ability of the Australian Taxation Office and law enforcement agencies to strike at financial gain which is the major incentive of international organised crime.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Existing reporting systems do not adequately provide for the monitoring of international transactions. This is a serious deficiency since it deprives the Australian Tax Office of an important source of intelligence in its efforts to combat international profit shifting to avoid tax liability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some international telegraphic transfers have been reported to the CTRA in the form of suspect transactions. However, this is only the "tip of the iceberg" in international profit shifting activities. Telegraphic transfers are effected in a very impersonal manner without the counter contact which brings the staff member face to face with the customer in circumstances where he or she might notice something peculiar about the transaction. As pointed out in the Martin Report, because of the sophistication of the abuse of withholding tax arrangements, the likelihood of the associated transactions being reported through the CTRA's current reporting arrangements is minimal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the issue of tax avoidance, the Martin Committee received evidence indicating that arrangements or schemes are operating in Australia which allow Australian residents to avoid their taxation obligations by paying 10% withholding tax instead of personal or company rates of income tax. Some of the schemes are extremely complex and difficult to detect, involving circuitous routes through various countries, including tax havens, and can often reappear as legitimate transactions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A feasibility study has shown not only the real need for law enforcement agencies to have access to information about such transfers to trace the profits of criminal activity, for taxation and confiscation purposes, but also that many cash dealers are in a position to readily provide much of this information. The remainder is transmitted by telex. While the proposed legislation will require the reporting of transfers transmitted by telex, the Government is conscious of the burden that this could impose on those cash dealers who conduct a high volume of telex transfers and whose systems are not computerised. It is therefore proposed to exempt those cash dealers from reporting telex transfers until the telex systems are computerised. International telegraphic transfer data is already in electronic form for transmission through the SWIFT System (Society for World-wide International Financial Telecommunication) and can be duplicated by cash dealers and transmitted on line to the CTRA.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I said earlier, the measures in the Bill will provide a necessary tool for detecting off-shore tax rorts, which are believed to be flourishing, and for assisting in the appropriate assessment of tax liability. Conservative estimates are of revenue gains in excess of $37 million per annum. The CTRA considers that 85% of non-cash funds transfers are remitted off-shore through the telegraphic transfer system. The Taxation Institute of Australia indicates how a substantial sum can slip through the reporting system as it currently operates. One instance is where, for example, $1 million, perhaps proceeds of a successful drug importation in the process of being laundered, is remitted to a tax haven by telegraphic transfer. This would not be reported since it is not in the form of cash. In this respect the current system is narrower in its scope than the previous tax screening system. Lost taxation revenue may, in fact, exceed $100 million per year, according to the Martin Report, with additional lost Customs revenue estimated at $10 million per year and proceeds of crime at $30 million.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In contrast the cost of implementing the proposal is relatively modest. The outlay in the first two years will be $13.08 million because of the capital investment in information technology facilities, but will be less than $5 million in subsequent years. There will also be costs to cash dealers, principally in the modification of computer equipment to duplicate existing data for transmission to the CTRA.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Bankers' Association and representatives of other major cash dealers groups have worked closely with officers of my Department and the CTRA in the development of this initiative, and I wish to thank them for their cooperation and support. This cooperation is continuing in the development of appropriate technology to permit the monitoring of such transfers to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme and its appropriateness to the practices of the finance industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill will make provision to protect banks (whether Australian or foreign) operating in Australia from any possible legal action which may arise in Australia from the banks complying with the reporting requirements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I also propose two minor amendments to the CTR Act: First to clarify the last point in time when a person is able to make a report to a customs officer when bringing currency into, or taking it out of, Australia, and secondly, to change the name of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and, the name of the Act to the Financial Transaction Reports Act.

        The Bill clarifies the obligation to report in section 15 of the Act. That section requires a person bringing into, or taking out of, Australia currency of a value greater than $A5,000 to make a report in a prescribed form to a Customs officer. An uncertainty was brought to light in a recent South Australian Supreme Court decision which held that a report could still be filed during a Customs baggage search without breach of the provision. The amendment clarifies this obligation by defining the last point in time when reports of such transfers can be made, namely prior to baggage search or prior to being given permission to leave the Customs control area without search for inwards passengers, and the point where Customs officers inspect passports for outwards passengers. Provision is also made in relation to persons other than passengers (crew, for example).

        The Bill will also amend the name of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. This title will more accurately reflect the nature of the Agency's major operations since, particularly with the addition of the reporting of international telegraphic transfers, only a minor proportion of the Agency's operations will relate to cash transactions. For the same reason, the name of the Act will also be changed to the Financial Transaction Reports Act.

        In conclusion, I stress that the country cannot afford to continue to suffer the vast revenue losses through tax and customs evasion or tolerate the removal off-shore of the proceeds of some of our most serious crimes. The average Australian is tired of seeing the high-flyers rort the system. The shareholders of this country are tired of seeing their investments moved off-shore, seemingly without trace and certainly beyond their reach, but no doubt to the personal gain of unscrupulous manipulators exploiting a loop-hole in the system which must now be closed off.

        A new three Band structure for the SES came into effect on 4 January 1990.

        The amendments proposed will enable Secretaries and Heads of Agencies to transfer SES staff across positions within the same band irrespective of the salary points involved.

        AMENDMENT BILL 1991
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill amends the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959. The main purpose of the amendments are: to enable ratification of Additional Protocol Number 3 (Montreal Protocol No 3) and Montreal Protocol Number 4; to ensure that the Montreal Protocol No 3 passenger limit applies immediately to Australian international air carriers engaged in carriage to which the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol apply; and, to convert the Poincare gold franc limits of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol to Australian dollars through the medium of the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Right (SDR).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The major reasons for amending the Act are two-fold. Firstly, it is considered that the carriers' liability limits currently applying to the international carriage of passengers by air are insufficient. These are currently around $14,000 or $28,000 depending on whether carriage is covered by the Warsaw Convention or the Hague Protocol. The proposal to ratify Montreal Protocol Number 3 and immediately apply its 100,000 SDR passenger limit to Australia's international airlines will go some way to redress this situation. 100,000 SHEARS, when converted to Australian dollars, is consistent with the domestic carriers' liability limit of $180,000.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia has international obligations under the Warsaw Convention and is only able to increase passenger liability limits, without dissociating itself from the international aviation community (i.e. by denouncing the Warsaw Convention), by ratifying Montreal Protocol No. 3.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, since the abandonment of the internationally set price of gold in 1973 and the introduction of a fluctuating market price, there has been no agreed means of determining the Australian dollar equivalent of the Poincare gold franc and the courts have often called on the Government to resolve the problem. The conversion of the gold franc limits to SDR equivalents resolves this problem.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given that the amount of passenger compensation encompassed by the 100,000 SDR limit may be considered insufficient, the Government is examining other options to provide equitable compensation to international airline passengers which will not affect the carriers' liability limits fixed by international instrument. This includes examination of the feasibility of a supplemental compensation scheme, perhaps similar to one under consideration in the United States.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Montreal Protocol Number 4 is specifically cargo oriented and introduces more modern cargo handling terminology and procedures, including the use of electronic data interchange (EDI).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the passenger limit of Montreal Protocol Number 3 will be applicable immediately to Australian international carriers, the Protocols will only become generally applicable to airlines engaged in carriage to which they apply when they enter into force internationally.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is my understanding that should the United States Senate accept the supplemental compensation scheme (called the S-Plan) referred to earlier, then it will support United States ratification of Montreal Protocols Numbers 3 and 4 by the President. It is also my understanding that this ratification may be accompanied by a denunciation of the Warsaw Convention. Unless Australia also ratifies the Montreal Protocols, this action could expose Australian carriers, particularly Qantas, to unlimited liability in the United States.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since it is our firm belief that US ratification of the two Protocols will lead to their early entry into force, they will in the not too distant future apply to carriage between Australia and the majority of countries. I understand that the US Senate may be voting on the Protocols in the near future.

        There are very good and cogent reasons for moving this motion.

         The Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration works well. It works in a cooperative manner. That is largely because of the relationship which exists between the Chairman, Senator Coates, and the Deputy Chairman, Senator Watson. In order for the Committee to work well in this area, to undertake the responsibility which the Senate has conferred upon it, the change in the terms of reference is very necessary. The Committee will work much better in this area if the terms of reference are precise because it will enable a much greater focus upon matters of concern relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I will say a little about that and some of the progress made in a number of those areas in a very short while. Given that the focus becomes precise, in my view, the evaluation becomes very precise, as will the specific recommendations which will emerge from the Committee on Finance and Public Administration.

         It is also pertinent to add that since then we have seen a recommendation from United States Congressman Stephen Solarz for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. We have seen the success of our foreign policy initiative on Cambodia. These things are relevant when we are looking at a department which has a policy making function rather than being oriented, as so many other Commonwealth departments are, to a program of budgeting for a series of obligations.

         To return to the Estimates committee process, at the Senate Estimates Committee B hearing on 4 September, Senator Evans raised with Senator Hill, the Leader of the Opposition, the desirability of reconsidering the question of a full-scale inquiry into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. To his credit, Senator Hill repliedâ€”and this is recorded in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         â€”that he would consider this and acknowledged that the Department had made considerable progress in several of the areas to be considered by the inquiry.

         That positive initiative from the Minister was met initially with a positive response from the Leader of the Opposition. As I have said on a number of occasions in my brief period in the Senate, it is my firm view on matters of foreign policy, defence policy and trade policy that, wherever it is humanly possible within the chamber and among the parties, it is very desirable to reach a consensus view after the arguments have been dealt with in a thorough and responsible manner.

         Senator Evans followed up that conversation in September with the Leader of the Opposition by writing to Senator Hill on 17 October suggesting that, if the terms of reference for the inquiry could not be withdrawn altogether, a reasonable compromise proposition could be offered to the Senateâ€”that is, simply to truncate the terms of reference to cover the management systems and program evaluation procedures of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Again, I think that was a most reasonable initiative for the Minister to take. It would certainly serve the purposes of the Committee and the Senate and achieve a better series of results. That process has now led to the motion that I have moved this morning.

         Lest there be any doubt, the view of the Government has always been that an inquiry into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is unnecessary. Senator Evans noted at the time the Senate was debating the inquiry's original terms of reference on 19 June that there was ample opportunity under the existing Estimates committee procedures to explore the kinds of issues covered in the inquiry's current terms of reference.

         However, if an inquiry is to proceed, as is certainâ€”whether under the terms of the original proposition or in line with the amendment which I have suggested this morningâ€”the Government believes the terms of reference ought to reflect the very significant progress that has been made by the Department in addressing the various allegations of maladministration and corruption and leaks to the media which were the background against which Senator Hill first moved to establish the inquiry. Again, it is fair to note that the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged the progress that has been made.

         At the conclusion of an eight-hour session on 4 September 1991 at which Senate Estimates Committee B examined the operations of DFAT, Senator Hill acknowledged, firstly, that there had been `considerable improvements' in the area of leaks; secondly, that the number of new allegations about maladministration and corruption had been `significantly reduced'; and, finally, that the criticisms of lax acquittal procedures within the Department had been `largely overcome'. From memory, on reading the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>

         There has also been progress on the issue of conditions of overseas service, which is a part of the inquiry's current terms of reference. I concede that there are several outstanding issues remaining in this area but I think it is significant to note that it is no longer the subject of industrial action as it was in November of last year. Indeed, it may be of interest to the Committee to note that, with the exception of the 24-hour stoppage called by the Public Sector Union last June to protest against the offer by the Department of Industrial Relations on overseas living allowance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not lost a single hour in industrial action over the last several years. I think that is a useful point to make and to note.

         â€”Over the last several years, with that exception I have made. With regard to the various allegations of maladministration and corruptionâ€”most of them made by a single officer of the Department who resigned earlier this year after he faced dismissal on eight counts of proven misconductâ€”an investigation by the Australian National Audit Office concluded that DFAT's processes for handling its investigations into the allegations had been effective. In fact, in all, 77 cases of fraud or misconduct were raised by the individual referred to above and by the anonymous and self-styled `Officers Revolutionary Council' within the Department. I, myself, find that to be an extraordinary title in an extraordinary circumstance. I am sure that a number of honourable senators around this chamber would share that view.

         Of the 77 cases raised in this circumstance, 76 have been closed and only one is still with the Australian Federal Police. In no case was either improper or illegal conduct established; in no case was impropriety established. The one remaining outstanding case relates to allegations that moneys were stolen from the Department's social club. It does not impinge upon the Department's management or administration because the management of the Department does not control the social club, as I am sure people would readily appreciate.

         Moreover, the Department's fraud detection efforts have not simply stopped with the investigation of these 77 cases. DFAT moved on to put in place strengthened procedures for investigating fraud, hard upon the claims that had been made last year and earlier this year. It has instituted a fraud prevention program aimed both at detecting fraud and inculcating high ethical standards among all of its officers. From the evidence overallâ€”whether statistical or anecdotalâ€”these procedures appear to be working.

         DFAT's fraud prevention and discipline section currently has 28 cases under investigation and nine discipline cases in train. I think that is a measure of the effectiveness of the action taken. The fraud prevention program is further reinforced by a revamped audit system which, in the financial year 1990-91, included audits of 27 overseas posts and eight Canberra-based programs. A very broad and effective net has been established.

         The existing terms of reference which I find unsatisfactoryâ€”and which I believe the Government finds unsatisfactoryâ€”refer to staff morale. This is a very complex issue. It is also very difficult, if not impossible, to measure. However, I think it is fair to say that any analysis of DFAT's very strong corporate identity and of objective indicators, such as the number of grievances, absenteeism, the number of disciplinary cases and rates of resignation and transfer, all suggest that DFAT does not have a serious morale problem.

         For instance, sick leave rates are around half the Australian industry average. Resignations account for only 0.9 per cent of all Public Service resignations, despite DFAT accounting for 2 per cent of Federal Public Service numbersâ€”all of this notwithstanding the stress, frustrations and disruptions which are an inevitable part of the nomadic lifestyle in a foreign service.

         In short, whatever justification there may have been in June this year for conducting an inquiry into DFAT, the situation today is quite different. Moreover, the existing and exhaustive Senate Estimates process, I think it is conceded throughout the chamber, will continue to provide ample opportunities to follow up any questions that honourable senators may have about the Department's performance. I think it is fair to say that satisfaction was registered about this during the most recent Estimates committee round of proceedings.

         We all support the principle of accountabilityâ€”the Parliament does and the Government certainly doesâ€”but we should also acknowledge that inquiries of this kind are extremely time consuming for all those involved and are extremely costly. They also serve to divert resources. They are costly in terms of time not only for the Department but also for the Committee and the relevant Ministers. Of course, overall, there is a cost involved which cannot be ignored or denied. If the inquiry is to proceed, it should therefore focus on those areas where, in my view and in the view of the Government, it could be most useful.

         In this case the Government considers that if the terms of reference are not to be withdrawn altogetherâ€”which obviously is not possibleâ€”they should be restricted to the management systems and program evaluation procedures of DFAT, where I am absolutely certain the Committee will come down with a series of very clear and reasonable recommendations, given the nature of the personnel and the nature of the other inquiries which we have conducted. I refer to the ongoing inquiry into the Commonwealth Ombudsman.

         An inquiry along these lines will be a useful exercise in terms of public administration generally. It is not confining itself to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its ramifications and applicability, not least because of the difficulty in devising appropriate evaluation procedures for a policy rather than a program focused departmentâ€”a point I made at the outset. It would also enable the Committee to assess what we consider to be the significant improvements which DFAT has made to its management systems over the last few years and which are conceded at all levels in the Parliament and, I believe, beyond. It is for all those reasons that I moved the motion at the beginning of my address in the terms I outlined.

         What I find more incredible is that Senator Loosley does this as an individual. It is not a case where the Committee has come back to the Senate querying the terms of reference or calling for a change in them. It is fair to say that he basically does it on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who is opposed to the inquiry and has been all along. That is not surprising; it is highly unusual for Ministers not to be opposed to inquiries into their departments. We have a situation where the inquiry is under way, has been advertised and made public and submissions prepared, and now one senator comes in and says that the terms of reference should be altered. As I said, that creates an undesirable precedent.

         Senator Loosely has put his case in measured termsâ€”and I appreciate thatâ€”although it is different from that which we would have received from the Minister this morning. Basically, Senator Loosely has argued that the terms of reference should now be varied because the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is performing better. Since the major public concerns were raised last year and since the terms of reference were first put down in my original notice of motion, which was far wider than that which was eventually agreed upon by the Senate, there has been considerable improvement in the performance of the Department. Therefore, the terms of reference should now be made.

When we were last before the Estimates, those figures had considerably improved.

         One that I can remember related to a discussion between my own leader, Dr Hewson, and General Murdani in Indonesia in which the General expressed certain views on what was happening in Papua New Guinea and what he expected to be Australia's responsibility in that regard. It was highly embarrassing. The next thing is that we read about it in the press. A cable that had come from Jakarta to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade had been leaked. The Department and the Minister had not even shown Dr Hewson the courtesy of sending him a copy of the cable, yet we read about it in the press, to Australia's embarrassment.

         I said to the Minister, as I conceded a moment ago, that there seemed to have been an improvement. Since the Estimates, unfortunately, I can tell Senator Loosley that the practice has deteriorated again. There has been a series of leaks from the Department. Perhaps the greatest irony in this debate is that one of them was a leak of the Department's view of this inquiry and what the Department intended to include in its submission to this inquiry. We read that in the newspapers, including Senator Evans's pencilled notes in the margin as to what he thinks of the inquiry, which he had told us previously in any event.

          That might be a matter of little consequence except that it was interesting that Mr Woolcott, the Secretary to the Department, did express the positive advantages that could come to the Department from the inquiry in which the Department will have an opportunity to put its case to the Committee. Apparently Senator Loosley in some way wants to remove that opportunity from the Department today.

         Senator Coulter will be interested in the next leak and, in some ways, I think he would argue that this should be on the public record, but I would say that this is not the right way to do it. Of greater consequence have been leaks which involve the Department's criticism of the way in which another Department, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, was dealing with the MFP in Adelaide. In this case we find a leak from a cable from Tokyo that DFAT was accusing the other Department of dealing with an important national project in a way similar to the Keystone Cops.

         So the matter of leaks, which is included in the terms of reference, should be looked at by the Committee. The acquittal procedures should be looked at by the Committee. The important issues that have been raised with me by officers of the Department in relation to overseas allowances should be looked at by the Committee. The amended terms of reference as sought would presumably rule them out. I think the Committee should look at the unique procedures that the Department has for recruitment and promotion. The Parliament has a responsibility to look at these issues, particularly when departmental officers are complaining to members of parliament about the operations of the Department. We have a responsibility, therefore, to pursue these concerns.

        He goes on to talk about his debt to the people in the Department for their contributions in producing his book. This is a personal book, his personal work, which he had all these departmental officers working on, to his personal advantage. Yet Senator Loosley comes in today and says that one of his arguments against this reference is that the Department will be put to extra work. I have just been reminded of another leak, the one in the

The Department has the time to do this job, which will enable the Parliament to conduct a proper inquiry into the affairs of the Department, and this is meeting the Parliament's responsibility to the Australian people.

         â€”The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Loosley, for reasons which roughly align with those that have just been outlined by Senator Hill relating to the concern over the precedential nature of changing the terms of reference after those terms of reference have been laid down and have been well and truly advertised. People have prepared submissions, and we understand that at least one submission has already been received. To change the terms of reference at this stage would be to set an extremely dangerous precedent.

         In his speech Senator Loosley canvassed some of the reasons why the terms of reference should be changed. But, having listened to the honourable senator, again it seems to me that that in itself is an extremely dangerous precedent to followâ€”that a Minister or a Minister's spokesperson would be able to explain away the reasons for an inquiry which had been agreed to quite some months before in this chamber, without the matter being properly and independently investigated as it would be by a committee. So, to some extent, whilst we would accept some of the factual information which Senator Loosley put before the chamber in relation to some of those terms of reference, in my view the processes by which he seeks to have the terms of reference changed again amount to the creation of a potentially quite dangerous precedent.

         The proposed new reference differs from the present reference in the following ways. First, it omits consideration of whether the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is fulfilling its role to protect and advance Australia's foreign policy interests, thus preventing policy issues being considered. Secondly, it omits explicit consideration of security procedures, overseas conditions of service and staff morale and performance. What is retained is an examination of the Department's management systems and program evaluation procedures. The omission of the first item would seem appropriate, given that consideration of policy issues is beyond the brief of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, to which the reference was ultimately given. The Australian Democrats have many foreign policy differences with the Governmentâ€”and not just in the foreign policy area, a matter which was alluded to by Senator Hillâ€”but this is not the forum in which to examine them.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The omission of the second group of items is justified by several considerations. A spate of leaks which prompted the inclusion of security procedures and classified material has ended, as Senator Hill himself acknowledged in the hearing of Estimates Committee B on 4 September. As Senator Hill has just explained, while there may be fewer of those leaks, they have by no means completely dried up. Secondly, there is little concrete evidence to support the view that problems with overseas conditions of service are serious enough to warrant parliamentary scrutiny. Thirdly, the Democrats' contact with departmental staff suggest a high quality performance with no obvious morale problems, a matter that Senator Loosley alluded to, and we accept that. Finally, there remains some scope for those three issues to be considered under the proposed new terms of reference, in so far as they relate to or arise from departmental management systems and program evaluation procedures.

         What we are hinting at there is that, even with the terms of reference being maintained, it is well within the ambit of the Committee itself to limit the width with which it considers particular terms of reference, the extent to which it accepts or does not accept particular submissions, and the extent to which it seeks to call witnesses from those who make submissions before it, and accept further evidence from them. So, in our view, the better way to proceed would be for the terms of reference to remain essentially the same, but for the Committee itself quite clearly to take into account those matters which Senator Loosley and Senator Hill have raised. During the September Estimates hearing, Senator Hill indicated a willingness to consider narrowing the reference, and he has alluded to that this morning. As we have heard, he has now reversed that view or at least given a higher priority to the question of creating a precedent. Our inquiry suggests that there has been no precedent in the pastâ€”no precedent at allâ€”for a substantive change to a committee reference. We believe it is quite appropriate for the Committee largely to confine itself to the terms of the proposed amended reference, but we believe that, as an issue of public trust and in light of the possibility of creating a very significant precedent, the amendment should not be passed.

         I reiterate that the Government has introduced a notice of motion to amend the terms of reference applying to an inquiry that has already been agreed upon and for which a submission or two has already been received and for which others are in the course of preparation. I agree with my Leader that this is an unusual request. It creates a precedent that the Senate should be cautious of endorsing. Although it is unusual, it is understandable, given the attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, all along the line and perhaps more latterly, towards the terms of reference of this inquiry. To withdraw or significantly change the terms of reference at this stage would raise questions of what is to be hidden and who has got at the Committee. It is basically an attack on the Senate committee system, which I believe we should be wary about accepting.

It is an unusual request in that, although the issues have been canvassed from person to person within the Committee, I do not believeâ€”and I stand to be correctedâ€”that this has been discussed formally and a resolution taken by the Committee.

It is up to the force of argument that particular members wish to put. We are winners and losers in this game.

Could the Minister give more information as to the sorts of diseases inspectors could be contracting, and what measures could be taken to prevent inspectors getting diseases from carcasses. I presume that meat inspectors wear gloves, masks if necessary, and take preventive measures such as washing and cleaning. Therefore, it surprises me that so many inspectors are beset by these diseases.

         I move to the other aspect of back problems, which I believe are always fairly hard to discern, having mentioned this topic to various medicos. I do not understand why there should be any such problems in view of the fact that no lifting is involved, as the Minister has already agreed.

         Could the Minister also comment on the matter of stress? I find it a little hard to correlate stress with workers compensation. I can correlate stress as related to long term sickness benefits for workers who cannot attend the workplace because of sickness rather than injury. I understand that workers compensation covers accidents and similar sorts of things that happen in the workplace, and diseases that could be picked up at work. But I thought that stress per se was a different problem removed from workers compensation and should be covered by sickness benefits, which should be borne by the social security operation or by the community as a whole rather than channelled straight down into the costs of AQIS, which is 100 per cent funded by the exporters who use the services.

         â€”Senator Panizza raises an interesting point. I appreciate the motivation for his concern as to the full recovery of costs. It is a concern to the Commonwealth too that we provide a healthy and safe workplace for Commonwealth employees. Therefore, Senator Panizza is right to say that protective clothing, hygienic preparation and cleanliness are high on our agenda, and by and large on the agenda of individual meat inspectors. No-one courts an exotic disease that might arise in an abattoir; they are often debilitating for a long time.

         All I can say is that despite the best protective measures and the most safety conscious and disease free environment that can be created, unfortunately people still contract diseases. Of the zoonotic diseases which, for longer term workers compensation recipients, amount to almost a quarter of the total number, 10 out of 44, fall into three major categories. These are brucellosis from cattle, Q-fever from goats and sheep, and leptospirosis from pigs. All I can report to Senator Panizza is that that is the incidence of the contracting of those diseases by people exposed to them for inspection purposes in the workplace.

         A number of back injuries result from accidents in the workplace. If I have the question right, Senator Panizza is asking whether the injuries are real and genuine and whether stress should be included at all. Let me say this on the first point, as to whether these are genuine cases: in order to be entitled to workers compensation benefits, one must receive a certificate from a certified medical practitioner saying that a problem or disease exists. The disease must be traced to an event or an exposure which, for all intents and purposes, is the cause of it. If it is believed by Comcare, which acts on behalf of this division of the Department on workers compensation matters, that there is reason to suspect that the diagnosis by the medical practitioner concerned is not accurate, second and third medical opinions can be, and are, obtained to be certain that the problem exists.

         Stress is a recognised medical condition that can arise in the workplace. It certainly can arise in the normal community. There is now a whole body of medical science available which considers the issue of stress. There are many causes of this condition. Often stress is related to the sense of responsibility and control which individuals have over their working lifeâ€”whether they are, in fact, regulated by the rate of the slaughter chain and have no control over their daily existence and how that impacts on their psyche. Again, these are matters that I am not competent to discuss in medical detail as I am not a medical practitioner. However, stress is universally recognised in the private sector and the public sector and under Acts of Parliament introduced by both Liberal and Labor governments and, therefore, is an accepted element of workplace life. It is therefore a recognised category. Unfortunately, there is an element of stress in the working conditions under which our meat inspectors work and that is a compensable condition.

         There is no argument that accidents occur in the workplace. Workers do suffer pain from back injuries. The Minister has said that there is stress in the workplace. I agree with thatâ€”there is even stress in this place. But how can we determine the degree of stress which results from the workplace, family life or some disappointment in life? I do not believe that anyone should have to bear the cost alone. If stress is caused by the pressures of family life or some other non-work related reason, the costs should be carried by the community as a whole, not necessarily by AQIS or by Comcare, which insures AQIS. That is the point I am trying to make.

         I will not labour the point for much longer. However, I would like the Department to look at this matter and make sure that the costs against the meat inspection services for injuries or other illnesses relate only to workplace injuries.

         â€”I have some general observations. If one acceptsâ€”and all of the evidence is that one ought toâ€”that stress is an element that can arise in a workplace and that it can have damaging effects on individual employees in different ways, the question of compensation arises. Senator Panizza suggested that there ought to be some way of measuring the degree of stress that arises in the workplace and in community life. With the greatest of respect to the honourable senator, I am not sure that there is. It depends on the circumstances of each individual case; it depends on a qualified medical practitioner making an assessment, finding a link and thus making a diagnosis. I am not sure that we can lay down criteria, other than that we ought not compensate for stress arising from non-work factors. That is certainly the qualification within our compensation system. As I say, we are in the hands of the diagnosticians in respect of causes. But, as I have said, it is true that in many workplaces there is considerable stress which gives rise to problems.

         Since I have been invited to make some comments, let me conclude with this generality: the more articulate areas in the work force voice their concerns about stress more than the less articulate. Often blue collar workers are more heavily stressed than white collar workers but white collar workers tell us about it more often. Therefore, we get a disproportionate view about where the stress factors are in the working community.

         The other matter is broader still: the presentation generally has not assisted the Estimates committees in their endeavours. In the 20 years or so since the Senate Estimates committees were established, they have been seen to perform an important role in subjecting Ministers and their departmental officers to detailed scrutiny and direct questioning by the Parliament. Before these committees were established, Estimates were debated in the Committee of the Whole for, on average, 42 hours. Today much more time is spent on the task of scrutiny. In the 1990-91 Budget sitting, Estimates committees met for 158 hours and the Committee of the Whole met for 40 hoursâ€”a total of about 200 hours.

In other words, are the Estimates committees able to do the job they were set up to do? If not, why not? How can the situation be improved? I believe that the information and presentation should be better and the time taken to examine it could be reduced. Each year we seem to be provided with more and more voluminous information by departments for the Estimates committee hearings, and this in itself poses a problem: greater is not necessarily synonymous with better.

While I realise that it is better to have ample information than not enough, the provision of this volume of material is ridiculous, especially when much of it becomes available only the day prior to the first hearing. How honourable senators are supposed to find the information they are interested in, let alone digest it and formulate questions, is a mystery to me. We have to ask more and more questions.

Performance of stated goals is what it is all about.

         Looking at the program performance statement for 1991-92 for the Department of Primary Industries and Energyâ€”which I refer to not because it is the best or worst example but because it is a portfolio in which I have a particular interestâ€”we find that for a particular subprogram an increase of over $24m, or 94.3 per cent, is shown in proposed outlays. This increase is considerable in anyone's language. The eight pages of text relating to the subprogram, no doubt carefully following the Finance guidelines, set out the subprogram objectives, who was responsible for the subprogram, what strategies were employed to meet the objectives, the performance indicators used to measure success, and the 1990-91 outcome, the outlook for 1991-92. In addition, there is even a section on compliance with the Government's social justice strategy. But nowhere is there a reference to, let alone an explanation for, the large variations in either outlays or revenue in the net program costs.

         Is it too much to ask for a little less verbiageâ€”much of which is available in strategic plans and annual reportsâ€”and more specifics? Could the resources summary table not be annotated in such a way as to provide brief but meaningful explanations for variations greater than, say, 15 per cent? I would think this would save everyone concerned a lot of time.

         There are also some evergreen questions relating to expenditures on consultants and travel. I know that the annual reports list consultants engaged, their costs and the program they are related to, but it would save us a lot of trouble in sitting down and adding up all the figures if consultancy costs could be shown in the resources table. There is clearly no reason why this should not be done.

         I and several of my colleagues also asked about travel expenditure and where we can quickly find out how much is spent under each subprogram. The answer was that this information is kept at a lower level in the financial system. Would it be too difficult to show such expenditure in the summary table to save the time involved in asking the same questions every year, to be taken on notice and provided later at additional cost?

         When I raised this matter with departmental officers during the hearing, I was assured that the papers were prepared in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Department of Finance. It seems from this response that it is not a question of ensuring that committees have the sort of information they want and need, but rather that this is the way the rule makers in the bureaucracy want it and this is the way it has to be done. I do not believe this is acceptable. The purpose of the exercise is to ensure that all senators have ready access to the operations of the Department in the form of a clear, concise and unambiguous statement, whatever the Department of Finance says.

         The result of this present approach is marathon sittings of the committees, at which much of the information has to be painfully dragged out of officials, sometimes because senators have been unable, or have had insufficient time, to identify the information they are seeking, and sometimes because the officials themselves are unable to answer questions from the papers before them. As a result, a large proportion of the questions are taken on notice, so generating significantly more work for the Department. Incidentally, I find it most extraordinary how often senior nominated officers have to take on notice routine questions on the policy, operation and/or detail of their areas of responsibility.

In the second answer I have been given a breakdown of AQIS expenditure and revenue by region for 1990-91. The regions and the States happen to be the sameâ€”I guess this is building on Senator Archer's propositionâ€”but the figures are very different. I cannot find any explanation as to why those figures are different. For example, the figure for the Australian Capital Territory, on a State by State breakdown, is $59,293,000; the figure for the Australian Capital Territory, by region, is $31m. I question why these figures are so substantially different. As I said, the regions and the States are one and the same thing, yet the figures are significantly different.

Senator Archer is saying that there is an immense volume of material, that one cannot always match the information one wants with the source of the answer, that it is a bit of a pain in the butt, one way or another, and that it takes a lot of our time.

         There are obviously reasons for this and Senator Archer alluded to some of them in his remarks. He referred to the Department of Finance guidelines about how these things must be drawn up; the guidance given to departments by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; and the fact that often we are comparing performances as set out in the annual report with projections for the Estimates. Some of the programs may have changed somewhat in the interim and, therefore, it is not a comparison of like with like. I understand all of those points. Notwithstanding that, there must be a way in which we can get to the root of these things. I sympathise with Senator Archer's view, although I must say the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is a very big department and I do know that the departmental officers strive to be as concise and direct as they possibly can.

Perhaps Senator Crane can indicate whether I am in fact answering the question he wants me to answer, because I am not entirely sure of the precise issue that he wants me to address.

         â€”When I look at these two sets of figures which were provided to me, it is not clear what they represent or whether they represent the same time period. My understanding was that during the past financial year we moved to a 100 per cent funding of AQIS. We have a collection of expenditure and revenue figures on a State by State basis and another collection of figures on a regional basis. Those two sets of figures relate to the same areas. But it is not clear to me how these two sets of figures are arrived at. The discrepancy is enormous. The Minister may wish to take this question on notice and come back with an answer.

The other documentâ€”which again was provided in answer to Senator Crane's questionsâ€”shows the 1989-90 AQIS budget of expenditure; that is to say, the items that were appropriated for. The other is actual expenditure. So the difference is that one relates to appropriations and the other to actual performance. If I were to anticipate Senator Crane's next question, he would ask why that is so and what caused that variation.

         This levy was the subject of some good economic news in that this is one of the imposts that have been reduced by the Government. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, made an announcement about that on 17 Octoberâ€”that is, since the Estimates committee stage. The purpose of the levy is to raise funds on behalf of the industry for meat marketing, research and animal disease control. The reason why we have been able to reduce the levy is that the BTEC programâ€”the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaignâ€”has reduced in cost. The component cost has now reduced from $2.10 to 85c because we have had significant success in having Australia declared free of brucellosis in 1989.

         â€”The Minister has made a few pertinent points that I would like to pick up. Perhaps I can give him or his Department some advice. He said in the first place that industry suggested it or that industry wanted it. That is the problem in the cattle industry and in many other primary industries: there are statements from the Minister that the industry wants it. But who in the industry wants it? In the case of the cattle industry it was the Cattle Council, and I can say the same about the Grains Council and the Wool Council. Maybe the Minister for Industrial Relations is not responsible for this, but all Ministers should be looking beyond what the industry wants to find out who in the industry wants it. Is it all the people in the industry or only a few in the peak body, who half the time are not elected democratically anyway? That is the danger. I believe the whole industry was not aware of what was going on, and that may be a debate for another day.

         As the Minister has said, we have moved towards the eradication of brucellosis. That original cattle transaction levyâ€”which changed from the slaughter levyâ€”has not long been in place. Anyone with half an eye could see how the brucellosis eradication campaign was going. We did not get rid of brucellosis overnight; it had to be worked on. In fact, the Fraser Government provided some incentive towards itâ€”I forget what it was exactly because that was quite some time ago. But there was an incentive for the brucellosis eradication program which started in the mid-1970s.

         It seems peculiar that the Minister should now tell me that suddenly we have got rid of it. Someone should have known that we would be rid of it by this time when the transaction levy was put in place a matter of 12 months ago. The Government should have been able to see it. I have already made the point about what industry wants. I believe we should look beyond that. As to whether it is fairâ€”whether the producer or the processor is getting itâ€”I have my own reservations about that which I will debate in this place at another time.

         â€”On 5 September during the Estimates Committee hearing I raised a number of questions with regard to proposals by the Department to conduct a future development workshop in northern Australia. I understood that this workshop was to be held in October or November 1991. At that time I was advised that the financial provisions had not been finalised. Whilst the objectives were to look at land conservation activity, I am keen to establish what progress has taken place with regard to the planning of that project.

         The Minister may recall that the questions I asked also related to the cross-portfolio references with the area covered by Senator Collins, as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, and the various economic and associated studies that Senator Collins had initiated at James Cook University. Has the Department had any consultation with the study unit at James Cook University?

Certainly, on a daily basis we have been promised a copy of it, but it has still not turned up. Given the fact that I raised this matter with the Department at the Estimates hearing on 5 September, I hope it has also been able to conduct discussions with James Cook University.

If he is not happy with the answer I gave yesterday, I will give him another one today, but it will be the same answer. The first question that Senator Tambling asked concerned when the conference is scheduled to be held. The answer is that no firm date has been selected as yet for the conference. A date is being canvassed tentatively for May next year, but at this stage that is not confirmed. Obviously we would like it to be settled as soon as can reasonably be done, but it is not a settled date at this stage; it is tentative.

         Senator Tambling asked me next about whether the Department has a copy of the JCU report of its economic strategy for northern Australia. The Department does not have a copy at the moment, but when it does it will obviously help the Department in its preparation for participation in the conference that has been scheduled. The Department would obviously like to see that report because this issue under the land resources division is about soil conservation and it has been raised by the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee within the Department. Our participation in the seminar will depend a littleâ€”not entirelyâ€”on what that report says.

         â€”It is interesting to note that the Department has obviously had the same problem as I have in soliciting the material out of James Cook University or through Senator Collins's office. That is indeed a pity, given that I am aware from Senator Collins that interim reports at least have been available as long ago as six or seven weeks. Why does the Minister now say that the conference will take place in May when the program performance indicator figures that were put to us at the Estimates committee hearings suggest that the conference was going to be held in October and November 1991? Why has there been a six-month slippage in conducting this conference?

         â€”I should correct an impression implicit in that question. I did not say categorically that the conference would occur in May; I said that is a tentative date being canvassed. Obviously we would like it to occur at that time. Senator Tambling asked about the reasons for the slippage in the old target date to the new target date. The reason is simply that this is a very difficult conference to coordinate. To get everyone together at the one time has proved to be an extremely difficult job. Therefore, one is placed in the position of going ahead with a less representative conference at an earlier date or projecting ahead to a date when most people's diaries can at least be reasonably clear and they are available. The key reason for the slippage in time is simply the availability of the representative key people.

         â€”It concerns me that the Department is taking this view. I would have hoped that, in the normal Budget cycles, a conference of this importance would have taken place earlier in a financial year. It was indicated to us in the performance notes that it was to take place in October or November 1991. If the conference is deferred until May 1991, any recommendations that participants in that conference may well have arrived at would then have extreme difficulty in being processed through the appropriate forums of the Department in the Budget Estimates, even for the 1992-93 financial year. I hope that such an important conference would also make recommendations to the appropriate ministerial council for consideration. In turn, that would again cause further delays if it has to end up at a ministerial conference as well as be subject to departmental and government responses.

         It seems that in northern Australia we have had a record number of conferences in the past few years. There is another one that I will come to on the agenda shortly under subprogram 4.1 relating to a conference held last March in Alice Springs convened by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Snowdon, but under the auspices of this Department. It made a number of recommendations with regard to transport. Other conferences have been held in northern Australia, in Broome, under the auspices of the Government relating to problems of health administration in remote and northern parts of Australia. All these issues do impact on the lifestyle and the industry of northern Australia. The constant deferral of these issues is a matter for concern.

         In both 1989 and 1990 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) convened special northern Australian conferences through the country task force. That task force made a number of recommendations both in 1989 and 1990 to which the Government has not yet responded in the normal and proper budgetary considerations. As I said, I will comment shortly on the transport ones, but again I highlight that this is an important issue. I would have thought that, with the Government's priorities relating to the environment, and particularly to land conservation, it would have been keen to have seen program and Budget activity at least in 1992. I am not really looking for any further response from the Minister, but I hope that the appropriate priority will be given and, if necessary, a big stick will be wielded in this regard to ensure that, if the conference is delayed until May, prompt action will then follow.

In doing so, and because I raised the matter in Estimates, I recognise the problems being experienced in Western Australia with the Rural Adjustment Authority and, in particular, the situation which existed with the operation of part B.

         A well known syndrome of `Get big or get out' has been operating throughout the Rural Adjustment Authority in Western Australia. As I said at the Estimates hearings, that attitude has become, in my view, totally self-defeating. In 1986 we saw those so-called farmers who were the efficient operators in 1982 being forced out of the industry because their debt was too high. We are now seeing a repeat of the restructuring process of the efficient producers that went on in 1986. They were restructured to take the inefficient people out. In that process their debtâ€”and, of course, their landâ€”built up. They are the people who are, by and large, experiencing serious financial problems today.

I certainly welcome that initiative. The Commonwealth is supplying the bulk of the money for the initiative; it is supplying all of it in parts A and C and a proportion in part B. I want to know, and it is important that it be answered, what action the Commonwealth will take to ensure that the States and, in particular, Western Australia activate part B. The Western Australian Government has been very neglectful in this regard, and it is not for a lack of representation by people like me and others. It has been very negligent and it must carry a lot of the blame for what has occurred in much of rural Western Australia.

         It is absolutely crucial at this time that, if the Rural Adjustment Authority is to be in place and operate effectively, its sole roleâ€”as it has been in the pastâ€”of getting farmers out of the industry and in the process building up the debts of others, has to stop. It is just impossible with the current cost structures and commodity prices to service those debts for any period of time.

Senator Richardson, in answer to a question yesterday, made reference to those changes and some aspect of being underemployed. One of the problems in terms of a rural operation, particularly with stock, is that people just cannot get up and leave that operation and work in another job because of the necessary husbandry requirements of the stock. If that were to occur, the animal welfare people would be chasing them around in circles.

Some of the questions that I want addressed in terms of this are as follows: how will the Commonwealth ensure that part B with the changed arrangements will be activated and not stay in the doldrums as in recent years? Under these new arrangements which will fit between RAS part B and part C, will individuals have to sign something saying that they will sell their property within a period of time or pay back the money, which they now have to do under part C?

I do not have a problem with going back five years, other than that I believe it is a fruitless exercise because what has happened in the previous five yearsâ€”particularly years four and fiveâ€”does not really have much impact on today's situation, but to draw up budgets for five years hence is a totally fruitless exercise. It is an expensive exercise. In most instances the budgets will be out of date within a month or twoâ€”sometimes lessâ€”of the time they are prepared. While I welcome the changes to part B, my fundamental questions concern how the Commonwealth knows that it will be activated, and the points regarding its sitting between the non-active part B, and part C.

         â€”Senator Winston Crane is right in saying that on 29 October this Government announced that it would increase rural assistance for Australia, specifically by injecting more than $60m in new funds into rural assistance over a full year, in recognition of the hardships that are currently being experienced in the farming sector. As he has said, earlier this year we increased funding to $160m; it has now gone up again by $30.64m for RAS and will increase to $41.81m in 1992-93. We have increased the ratio of one dollar Federal for one dollar State to two dollars Federal for one dollar State because of the need, under part B, for some special assistance.

         â€”In giving those answers, particularly the last part, I believe the Minister has misunderstood my question. The announcement by the Minister was that the provisions will target those farmers who fall between RAS part B, carry-on assistance, and part C, re-establishment assistance. Under part C, re-establishment of assistance, individuals have to sign something saying they will sell or pay back the money; under part B they do not have to. My question was that with this falling between the twoâ€”I am not sure whether to call it part B 1/2, 1/2C or what, and I guess it does not matterâ€”will the provisions that apply to part B be applied in terms of that assistance; or will the provisions which apply to part C apply, where individuals have to sign something saying that they will sell within the period of time which, as the Minister rightly said, has been extended to 12 months, or they will pay back the money?

         â€”I do not have specific questions such as those that Senator Crane has asked, but I want to make some comments regarding subprogram 2.2, which deals with rural adjustment and services. I note that one of the objectives is to `redress barriers to rural people's access to the full range of government and other social, economic and rural services'. This area naturally covers a broad range of assistance measures, including the rural adjustment scheme. Only last week we finally saw the Government providing some sort of adjustment to the scheme, and other social and economic benefits are to be provided for rural families.

         The rural assistance package announced by the Government has many commendable aspects, though it still amazes me that, with all the bureaucrats here in Canberra and all the task forces and committees that the Government establishes, it has taken until now to recognise the extent of suffering in rural areas. Indeed, the Government's own drought task force had reported 18 months ago but still the Government did not have a national drought policy, or even a definition of extreme drought or hardship. At that time the task force recommended the establishment of a part D to the rural adjustment scheme, to provide household support, equivalent to unemployment benefits, to farmers in extreme hardship.

         It is astonishing to realise that the Government has only now appreciated that in various parts of Australia, and particularly in Queensland, we are in the middle of an extreme drought. Actually, the Labor Government in Queensland took a long time to come to that point of view as well. In some parts of Queensland and New South Wales it is the worst drought in memory. Already 55 per cent of New South Wales has been drought declared. Predictions are that 20 per cent of farmers in drought areas will fail. In my own State of Queensland, $500m of rural production has now been lost.

         In the light of these depressing figures, the rural assistance package announced last week is for some, I regret to say, too little, too late in coming. However, the decision to offer social security benefits to farmers experiencing extreme hardship as a result of the rural downturn will help many farmers stay above the poverty line. I also welcome the extension of part C of the rural adjustment scheme, which will allow farmers up to six months to decide whether to leave their farms. However, I believe that the money that will be advanced in the way of household support should be by means of a grant rather than a loan. Indeed, the only way to fix the welfare gap is to provide farmers with either unemployment benefits or household supportâ€”but surely not another loan. I wonder whether there is any possibility of the Government looking into this matter.

         I have also noted that the Government has recognised the way that it ruined the income equalisation deposit scheme. The Government needs to reintroduce some of the incentive that was present in the original scheme so that farmers can be more self-reliant in hard times. This is something that I believe to be very important and very worth while, particularly when we see so many people in rural Australia in financial difficulty at present. I am also pleased that the Government is still reviewing the natural disaster relief arrangements with a view to making Commonwealth assistance more readily available.

         Many of these adjustments in relation to improving the access of farming and rural families to the various government social and economic services still do not go far enough. While it is fascinating that the Government has finally recognised the impact of extreme hardship on farmers, I believe that the measures that the Government has taken will still be inadequate. There will still be a number of areas that will fail to deliver in the provision of services to those from rural areas. As I said earlier, one of the objectives of the rural adjustment and services subprogram is to `redress barriers to rural people's access to the full range of government and other social, economic and rural services'. One area where rural families are still not receiving the full range of government services is in the provision of education and other facilities to rural families.

         I am perhaps going a little beyond the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, as this involves the education portfolio as well, but I refer to the provision of assistance by the Government under the isolated children's scheme. I raised this matter in the Senate on Tuesday during Question Time, as many people in rural Australia are experiencing a real problem. In responding, Senator Bolkus did not seem to fully understand what my question meant. He did, though, give me a lecture on the rural assistance package. The Federal Government's refusal to change eligibility requirements for the isolated children's assistance scheme has already and will continue to force many rural families to withdraw their children from schools. The asset test provision for the scheme means that many rural families will not qualify and either will have to sell up, as is happening in many cases, or take their children out of school. I asked the Minister whether the Government would consider basing the eligibility criteria for this benefit on income alone. He refused to acknowledge that these problems exist and instead chose to give the Senate a lecture on the rural adjustment scheme.

         Under the Government's current rural assistance package, some rural families will now qualify for social security and other benefits. However, the Government has still not recognised that unless a family does qualify it will not receive any assistance for education. That to me seems to be a real problem. It seems that the Minister knew no more about what the question meant than the Labor Party knows or cares about the problems that are confronting rural Australia. Many farmers have assets but no liquidity. They are asset rich but income poor. They cannot say that they will pay their bills with their stockyard. Perhaps they could pay them with the sale of stockâ€”if they had some stock or crops that were of some value.

         In fact, the Minister seems to be unaware that many farmers are currently experiencing circumstances in which they have no income or even negative income as a result of the disastrous drought and the rural downturn. It is for this reason that I believe that the eligibility requirements should be changed to a test on income and not on assets. That to me is a very important point. With no money coming into rural households and with farming families being refused those allowances, many young people are being denied the same opportunities as those available to people who live in the cities. It is now imperative that the Government set in place policies that will alleviate the huge cost burdens faced by primary producers. Perhaps some of those comments did not relate specifically to the subprogram, but this is all related to the rural adjustment scheme, and I wanted to put those points on the record.

         â€”In the Senate Estimates Committee, I asked a number of questions arising specifically from the conference convened in Alice Springs in March of this year by the Parliamentary Secretary for transport, Warren Snowdon, who is also the Federal member for the Northern Territory. The conference was subsequently convened under the joint auspices of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Transport and Communications. I have received a comprehensive reply to three questions I asked relating to the recommendations that arose from that particular conference. One of my questions was, `Will the response to the recommendations of the conference be tabled in the Parliament?'. I find it quite ironical that the answer to that question was, `It is not proposed to table the report of the conference in the Parliament'. Yet, attached to the document I have, which relates to that report, are the responses to the recommendations arising from the report. It is, in effect, attached to the answers that were made available to the Committee. There are detailed responses to some 24 recommendations and a further attachment of an additional two pages relating to government initiatives aimed at rural and remote Australia.

         So, in effect, an 11-page response has been tabled in the Parliament through the mechanism of this Committee, yet the answer given is that it is not proposed to table the report of the conference itself. I find that rather ironical and, to some extent, stupid. I believe that the full conference report ought to be tabled. As a participant in that conference, I have received a copy of it and it is an important document. About 100 people attended that conference, the majority of whom were public servants or academics from elsewhere in Australia. I think there were also 20 or so people drawn from interest groups or the private sector.

         However, the report was an important document, given that transport in rural and remote Australia is currently on the national agenda and is a very important and major issue which will proceed to the Special Premiers Conference to be held in Perth later this month. It concerns me that the Department and the Government do not propose to make available for public comment a conference report that obviously bears on the whole arrangements affecting transport industries in rural and remote Australia. We are all well aware that there is a degree of controversy between the Prime Minister and the Premiers and also between the Federal Government and the State governments about so many issues relating to transport policy development.

In what areas do they diverge from the agenda that has gone forward to the Premiers Conference? To what extent have matters of detail, which are to be determined by the Prime Minister, the Premiers and the Chief Ministers, already been, in effect, canvassed and addressed by the Government in this response before us?

         Therefore, it is of concern that the Minister at the table is not able to give any information about the Government's proposals. The Government made this response to the special conference that it convened in March of this year. Yet this same Government, which is now preparing a case for major consideration of transport initiatives as a fundamental issue to be addressed at the Premiers Conference, is not able to confirm or deny that it is varying in any way the fundamental principles it has established in this response in the documentation it is now taking forward to probably the most important conference of the year, the Premiers Conference on 21 November. It is an issue that is of major concern. It again highlights what I was alluding to earlier when I referred to the other conference being convened by the Government on land conservation. The Government is good at getting out into the community and running conferences. However, when it comes to picking up and taking forward the recommendations of those conferences, and responding to them as a government, it is then not able to say what its policy will be.

However, the Government has chosen not to table it, only its 24 responses, but is then not in a position to tell us whether those responses are the negotiating items that the Prime Minister wants to present. I assure the Government that I will assess every one of those 24 recommendations against what the Prime Minister publicly says in the next few weeks and against the results and the consequences that he is seeking to obtain between the Federal and State governments. I find it absolutely astounding that the Minister is unable to give this Committee any assurance that the Prime Minister is being consistent with a Government response that has obviously been made in the past month or so.

         The issue is that the recommendations of this conference and the responses that have now been seen are part of a policy development process. Senator Tambling asked me what the Prime Minister will tell the Premiers. I will not tell him what the Prime Minister will tell the Premiers. The Prime Minister will tell the Premiers first and not have me tell Senator Tambling what he, the Prime Minister, is to tell the Premiers before he has a chance, firstly, to make up his mind properly in consultation with the Cabinet what he will tell them; and, secondly, to give a courtesy to the Premiers that they should hear what he wants to say first and not through some back door, roundabout route.

         â€”I wish to raise a number of issues on the Federal Airports Corporation that arise from questions that I placed before the Estimates Committee. These were commented upon in the report of the Committee as well as in a reservation that I expressed. On page 2 of the Committee's report, the Committee noted:

       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Apart from the FAC's management of Bankstown Airport, the Corporation was queried about its management of aircraft parking, the basis of its profit and dividend calculations, the gate access for Compass Airlines at terminal buildings, the application of parking fees, the progress in commercial leases at Darwin and Alice Springs, general aviation facilities at Darwin, its program to acquire works of art, the profitability of the airport terminal at Hobart and its handling of duty-free concessions that are tendered for at overseas terminals.

        That paragraph refers to the general issues, about half of which were the ones that I specifically raised. I am concerned that I received what I consider to be a very inadequate series of answers on the issues that I raised. In effect, the answer that the Minister provided is that the Federal Airports Corporation has provided the following answer: `The matter is commercial-in-confidence and therefore not available'.

Another one related to a request for a schedule of the names of the tenants and tenancies, the status of those leases that are signed and not signed at the new terminal at both Darwin and Alice Springs, and the third question asked for costs to the FAC budget for interest or other costs to compensate concessionaires for the delays in opening at Darwin and Alice Springs terminals.

         I do not believe that answer is appropriate for this Committee to accept. After receiving that answer, very early in the piece I said to Senator Collins that it was totally inadequate and inappropriate. There is an important point of principle of a corporatised arm of the Government seeking to hide behind an answer that it is an issue of commercial-in-confidence. If the organisation was totally privatised, I could fully understand the extent of that answer. But, given that the FAC is not, it still has a strong responsibility that it must honour to this particular Parliament. The answers are inadequate; they are insulting. They are not matters that I believe would in any way affect the commercial operations of any individual or operation that would be embarrassing. All of the information ought to be available and publicly on the record, given the nature of the public service that these important airport terminals will serve.

         The other issue I raised, on which I have received some but I believe inadequate detail, related to the series of questions I asked about the remuneration and basis for engagement of Dr Battersby, who was a special art adviser to the Federal Airports Corporation. I asked for a rough annual Australia-wide appropriation for the acquisition of art for the financial years 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. I certainly received a satisfactory answer about the expenditure on art acquisitions for airports in 1990-1991, which was of the order of $370,000, and the estimated budget for expenditure on art acquisitions in the 1991-1992 financial year is $1.45m. That is an amount of money on which we can take whatever view we like as to whether it is proper, adequate or whatever.

         I have heard Senator Collins give complimentary mention to some of the particular art that has been installed in the new terminals at Darwin and Alice Springs airports. I accept that it is probably of a good standard. Senator Collins knows full well that I had hoped previously that there would have been more local content and local involvement in the choice of that art for the respective terminals in Darwin and Alice Springs. However, I believe that the FAC has avoided answering the question relating to the remuneration of Dr Battersby, and I believe that there is no commercial confidentiality with regard to a consultancy of that nature.

         It has been suggested that, because a corporation is fully funded publicly, the individuals who then deal with the matter are required to have all their business dealings laid out for the public gaze. I do not support that at all and never have, and I have been consistent on that matter for 15 years. Having said that, I can assure Senator Tambling that when he looks at these lists he will see that some of this information is sensitive.

I have the information and, if Senator Tambling is prepared to give an undertaking that he will treat it as confidential, I am happy to provide it to him on that basis. In view of the hour, I would like to deal with the question of Jean Battersby separately.

It was even too much for Egdo, he had to replace half of them after the last two days.

Quite accurately, he continues to blame Mr Keating, and the Cabinet of which he was a member, for creating the high interest rates and the unemployment. They are not words of political rhetoric that I am using from an opposition point of view, or from a point of view of political opposition to the Government; they are the words of the Deputy Premier of a State government. The Deputy Premier of Queensland is perceptive enough and honest enough to acknowledge that it was Mr Keating and his policies, and the Cabinet of which Mr Keating was a part, that created the unemployment and the high interest rates.

They did that with Barry Unsworth. I think their arrogance through the whole of the Unsworth thing lead to the disaster that they had electorally and the workers of NSW are suffering for that now.

         As a Queenslander I have been concerned for some timeâ€”and I have said it in this chamberâ€”at the number of Queenslanders in the Hawke Ministry. It is of concern to Queenslanders. I accept that Ministers should be appointed on merit, not because they come from a geographic part of our nation. By the same token, I consider that there are people in the ALP in Queensland who are equally as good as the people in the ALP in Victoria or the ALP in New South Wales, or even the Northern Territory. There is no Queenslander in Cabinet at all. Why Queenslanders have such a minuscule representation in the Federal Ministry is something that I have always been concerned about. It reacts badly on the State of Queensland. When we have 11 Ministers coming from the State of Victoria and only 2 1/2 from Queensland, we can be assured that the Victorian view and the Victorian problemsâ€”and they have plenty of themâ€”receive greater consideration and greater interest from this Government because of their sheer numbers in the Ministry.

One may ask what this has to do with what Senator Richardson has done today. It is turning into a battle royal between the Queensland Labor members who are excluded from the Ministry and who, almost to a man, support Mr Hawke in the contest for the leadershipâ€”with a couple of exceptionsâ€”and the New South Wales Right and the people in New South Wales who are supporting Mr Keating in his leadership challenge. That is what it is all about. That is why Senator Richardson is so determined to denigrate the Queensland Labor people and the Queensland Deputy Premier. Senator Collins may have an interest in it as well. It may well be that he is frightened of losing his job if they put people with some competence into the Ministry. He would probably be the first to go. The Ministerâ€”not because Caucus wanted him or that he had any abilityâ€”is only there because Mr Hawke wanted him there to pay back a favour. The minute Mr Hawke goes, the Minister is finished, and he knows it. That is why it is so desperate.

         â€”I raise a subject of considerable importance in terms of propriety of government and of economic policy setting. It is a subject which has received insufficient consideration in this place over recent months. I refer to two or three extremely important articles by Laura Tingle in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian
         </emphasis>
         over recent weeks. In an article this week, on Monday, 4 November, she asserts that the Federal Government tried to circumvent formal monetary policy-making processes before the last policy change in September. The article is referring to what was the last interest rate change at the time this article was written and it asserts that the Government placed intense pressure on the Reserve Bank to cut rates before the bank Board had met to discuss the issue.

         That is a very serious claim by Laura Tingle and, to my knowledge, there has been no denial by the Government, by either the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), of the accuracy of that story. Indeed, the thinking behind it has been confirmed, I would have thought, by the decision this week of the Reserve Bank Board to lower the interest rates as of yesterday by 1 per cent. That was a decision that was taken by the Reserve Bank Board on Tuesday, of course, but it was taken after many days of speculating by the Prime Minister, by his Ministers, by leaders of the ACTU, in my view absolutely improperly, about interest rates. The speculation gave the strongest implication that interest rates would be cut at that Board meeting earlier this week.

         Indeed, I find it extraordinary that the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, should have indulged in such improper speculation in the light of the fact that he is a member of the Reserve Bank Board.

         But my main purpose today is to come back to what happened in September with the reduction in the interest rates that was announced by the Reserve Bank after its Board meeting on 3 September. In the House of Representatives on that day the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, said, on the subject of monetary policy, that when he became Treasurer there were two things that he was very clear about concerning interest rates: the first was that he was not going to overreact to one month's figures; the second was:

       <para>
        All the evidence to date suggests that due process was flagrantly flaunted by the Treasurer and by the Prime Minister on the very day before the Treasurer made that statement in the House of Representatives. According to the report in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        â€”a report which, to my knowledge, has not in any way been deniedâ€”the Treasurer, acting on pressure from the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's advisers, rang the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, and put it to him that rates should be lowered. Apparently, he asked Mr Fraser what would happen if he, the Treasurer, directed the bank to cut rates.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Mr Fraser, to his credit, apparently replied in the strongest possible terms in opposition to that proposal, because the bank has a standing rule that it will observe due process when it comes to the setting of monetary policy. There is a longstanding conventionâ€”indeed it is perhaps more than a conventionâ€”that the Reserve Bank will only make changes to interest rates after proper process and after all the formalities of policy-making have been followed. That includes a standing decision by the Reserve Bank Board that rates not be cut ahead of meetings of the Board and that it is the proper process of the Reserve Bank Board to consider whether rates should be changed.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian
         </emphasis>
         raises very serious issues indeed. It raises issues of the gravest significance in terms of the role of the Prime Minister in trying to deliberately circumvent the proper processes of monetary policy setting. One will recall that the Prime Minister was under considerable pressure at that time from his Caucus to do something about the economic situation. He was facing considerable pressure in the Caucus meeting of that week and he wanted to demonstrate to Caucus that the Government was acting by easing monetary policy. That was the reason why he pressured Mr Kerin to put pressure on the Reserve Bank to circumvent the normal processes and accept standards of monetary policy-making to cut the rates without going through the normal Reserve Bank Board meeting process.

         That is playing politics with monetary policy and with the economy, par excellence. Perhaps we should not be surprised about that. We have seen nothing but such opportunistic, populist, internal Labor Party division-ridden, economic policy-making for months and months. That is one of the fundamental reasons why this country is in the desperate state that it is in, with unemployment again today showing massive levels, employment having fallen, people having dropped out of the process of looking for jobs, with a further fall in the participation rate. They are matters on which I am sure my colleagues, in particular Senator Michael Baume, will be speaking later today.

         They are the very reasons why we have the desperate economic situation and the tragedy and hardship for more than one million who are on the unemployment heap that we have in this country. If we are to get away from the proper processes and the proper conduct of monetary policy, that is a very damaging situation for this nation. It heightens again the importance of having a Reserve Bank that is independent of the government of the day. That is why the coalition has, in statements over the last year or more, laid so much stress on the need to increase the independence of the Reserve Bank, to cut the ties between the Reserve Bank and the Government, so that there is no prospect of a repeat of this disgraceful type of performance that apparently occurred prior to the September Board meeting of the Reserve Bank. As I say, this was done for purely internal Labor Party political reasons. If it had not been for the Governor of the Reserve Bank reacting very properly and very strongly to the actions of the Treasurer or, through him, the Prime Minister, we could have seen very much a violation of the proper processes of the formulation of monetary policy.

          Australian

         of Monday this week. It follows a similar type of article she had in the paper a month earlier. The question to be answered is: are those articles alleging impropriety on the part of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer correct or are they not correct? It requires one simple answer on the part of the Prime Minister or the Treasurer if they are incorrect, but not one word has come from the Government, since the articles first appeared in early October, to in any way suggest that those allegations are incorrect. If those allegations are correct, I believe that is a matter of very grave significance for this country, because it once again puts the formulation of economic policy and the manipulation of economic policy and monetary policy and interest rate policy in the hands of a government which has shown that it is unfit to manage and to govern this country. I fully endorse the conclusion to be drawn, if those allegations are correct, from these articles by Laura Tingle. I quote:

        This amendment relates to the age discrimination element, which is being removed by Opposition amendments. The Government was also seeking to remove it by similar amendments. This particular amendment has a difficulty for the Government, in so far as it applies to the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Under our amendment all people on the board of that Agency, including the Chairman, would have been exempted from the requirement to retire at 65. The Minister has told me that he has a concern, in that it is possible under the Australian Sports Drug Agency legislation to have a full time executive chairman. It is not in the spirit of the amendments that the Opposition has been moving for full time executive chairmen to be excused from retirement at 65, whereas normal board members would be.

         I will not deal with the merits of this case, largely because I guess I have a vested interest in the matter. My cousin Peter Baume is the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. I would leave it to Senator Chapman, who I think has some views on this, to deal with it. All I would say is that, on balance, we think there is merit in proceeding with our amendment; at the moment there is not a full time executive chairman and we cannot see why the Chairman of this organisation should be subject to any inhibitions that other board members are not subject to.

         â€”In supporting the remarks of my colleague Senator Baume with regard to the Australian Sports Drug Agency, I make the point that it is unacceptable to the coalition to maintain age discrimination in any form. When we debated this issue a couple of weeks ago, the Government responded that in terms of non-executive chairmen it was accepting our position on age discrimination, but as far as executive positionsâ€”executive officersâ€”were concerned, it would not accept the arguments and the proposed amendments of the Opposition.

         Yet this in itself, apart from being a blatant continuation of unjustified age discrimination, is inconsistent with the Public Service Act itself, which allows public servants to stay on in their jobs beyond the age of 65 years. In particular, division 8A of the Public Service Act provides for secretaries to departments to remain beyond the age of 65 years, at the discretion of the relevant authority. Division 8B of the Public Service Act allows a similar discretion for senior executive officers of the Public Service to remain in office beyond the age of 65 years. Division 8C provides the same opportunity for other officers of government departments.

         Section 33 of the Public Service Act, which relates to the application of the merit principle, provides that there should be no discrimination in the Public Service on the ground of age. Furthermore, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regulations provide that it is an offence to discriminate on the ground of age, and that such offences may be heard by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner.

         On those grounds we do not accept that, because the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Agency in particular may at some future time be a full time executive chairman, he should thereby be forced to continue the possibility of suffering age discrimination. We believe that age discrimination should be removed in all its forms.

         The Government raised the argument that in particular circumstances it may not be appropriate for a person to remain in such a position beyond the age of 65 years. If the provisions of the Public Service Act are applied, in those circumstances the person would not stay on, because it is a discretionary decision that can be made for someone to remain beyond the age of 65. We believe that subsection 20(3), which does not allow the appointment of anyone over the age of 65, should be removed so that age discrimination does not continue, and then at least the discretion remains to allow the appointment of someone over that age, should he or she be a fit and proper person and competent to hold that position.

         â€”I think the Minister has previously indicated that he is not willing to accept Senator Baume's amendment because it would remove the age limit from the chief executive of the Sports Drug Agency. The Government's amendment No. 5 is preferred because it is limited to the part time members of the Agency. I have listened to what Senator Chapman had to say in expansion of this matter and I will draw it to the attention of the Minister, but at the moment the Government's position is to persist with its amendment and reject the Opposition's.

        This is one of a series of similar amendments that the Government is not agreeing to. We will not press them. This relates to the Sports Drug Agency and to the manner in which members of the Agency could be stood down pending any inquiry if charged with an offence punishable by 12 months imprisonment. We are not pressing this amendment. We think it is the right thing to do but, if the Government is not prepared to accept it, we will concede.

        That amendment is a similar amendment to the ageist one that Senator Chapman spoke to in relation to the Australian Sports Drug Agency, where there is a capacity for the chairman to be a full time executive chairman, even though the person at present occupying the position of chairman is not an executive chairman.

         I repeat that we find it an extraordinary situation that some governmental bodies, such as the Australian National Gallery with Mr Whitlam, are able to have a chairman who exceeds this age limit, but the Australia Council is unable to have such a chairman, even though he is not a full time executive chairman, but because the chairman may well be, if the Government so decides, a full time executive chairman. It seems to me that the Government has not sorted itself out properly on this matter. It would be a good idea if it did.

        The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on rice produced in Australia to raise funds for a research and development program for the rice industry. This has been requested by the Ricegrowers' Association of Australia on behalf of New South Wales' rice growers and on behalf of the Queensland Rice Marketing Board, which represents Queensland rice growers.

        The Government's rural research and development policy, which encourages increased contributions by primary industry, was established by the Government in February 1985 and reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement, "Research Innovation and Competitiveness".

        The industry produces around 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes of paddy rice per year, with a gross value of production in 1989-90 of $148m. About 85-90 percent of production is exported to around 30 countries.

        The rice industry has a major commitment to research in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position.

        Under current industry research funding arrangements, both the NSW and Queensland rice industries fund research on a budget allocation basis. That is, the industry agrees on the total amount of contribution before the start of each financial year and, in fact, before the greater proportion of rice is harvested. This ensures a reliable flow of funds to the research program, whereas a volume based funding system would have reflected the swings in production which have occurred over the last few years. For example production fell from 923,000 tonnes in 1989-90 to a forecast 726,000 in 1990-91.

         â€”The purpose of the Rice Levy Bill 1991 is to impose a levy on rice produced in Australia to support research into the industry. This levy is to be matched by the Commonwealth up to a maximum of the rice industry's gross value of production for the rice industry. This brings the rice industry into line with many other rural industries which have been successful in securing a dollar for dollar industry-government payment arrangement for research.

         The history of the rice industry extends back to the early 1890s when the earliest commercial rice crops were grown by Chinese market gardeners in the Northern Territory. Rice was grown at Humpty Doo and Pine Creek in order to supply Chinese people working on the gold fields. Currently, production of rice is located mainly in New South Wales, where rice crops have been commercially grown since 1924, and more recently in Queensland, from 1967.

          This legislation simply sets a maximum levy of $2 a tonne and the operative level will be set each year by regulation. This is necessary because the industry wants to continue with a firm budgeted amount at the beginning of each year, and it will not be until harvest time that it knows how much rice is likely to be produced and therefore how much levy needs to be applied to achieve its result. The swings in production are so pronounced that the industry believes that this is the only way to ensure a reliable flow of finance to the vital research program. It does mean that in some years the levy may be above 0.5 per cent of annual gross value of the product. In that case anything above 0.5 per cent will not be matched by the Commonwealth.

         The rice industry is an important industry. It is a world leader in efficient production, and 85 per cent of rice grown in Australia is exported. If fair access to international markets were given to Australian rice, production could expand quite considerably because the Australian industry can compete. However, rice is subject to restrictions in international trade. Japan is well known for its rice importing restrictions, as are Taiwan and Korea. There are also restrictions in other South East Asian countries. There is a general assumption that these countries would be able to produce rice more cheaply than Australia. They cannot. The cost of production of rice in Japan and I believe also in Taiwan is three to four times that in Australia.

         Rice has been grown in Queensland on and off for over 100 years, but the modern rice industry in Queensland commenced in 1968 when a small group of farmers, under the auspices of the Lower Burdekin Development Council, commenced growing long grain rice, which had been developed in the United States. I well remember those days when there were two groups growing rice in the areaâ€”it was a very small and infant industryâ€”and the two groups were actually competing. Each ended up building its own mill. But since those days things have settled down and there is now one organisation, one operation, in the Burdekin area.

The areas under production in the Burdekin are 2,250 hectares, and in Mareeba, 1,000 hectares. Unlike the Riverina crop, in north Queensland there are two crops each year. There is the winter crop, which is the major crop because it has better yields of 6.5 tonnes to 7 tonnes per hectare, which occur because of better weather conditions and less insect infestation at that time. Approximately 20,000 tonnes of paddy rice is produced from that crop. The summer crop has lower yields, and it is also slightly less economic because of the higher watering costs, and because of more difficulty with pests. About 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes of rice are produced in the summer season. The winter crop is planted in July-August, and the harvesting commences very soon, and goes on for a couple of months. The summer crop is planted around this time, and again goes on for a couple of months and is harvested in April and May.

Just think about the fact that there are 20 million people in Taiwan, every one of whom will eat at least one moon-cake every year, and one can see the enormous market for processing of the rice into forms other than table rice. We are talking of probably about five million pounds of rice being eaten in Taiwan in the form of moon-cakes in just one day of the year.

         That is why it is very important that we continue to put money into research and development for the rice industry, not only so that we are and remain the most efficient producers of rice, in terms of the grain itself, but also to ensure that we, as rice producers, are also the most efficient processors of rice. This is the crux, because the rice industry, especially in Queensland, is characterised by a group of people who control the production of the rice from the farm right through to the finished product. So all the improvements in processing efficiency will be passed back directly to the growers.

         The imminent release of coconut flavoured rice in New Zealand, where there is a large South Pacific islander population, is one of the ways that industry members are grasping hold of the potential to sell rice into niche markets and to maximise return, not just to themselves but to Australia as a whole.

          Taiwan is facing imminent entry into GATT. We know that Taiwan's market practices, its trade practices, have not been lilywhite in the past and that Australia has been on the receiving end of them. I have said in this chamber on numerous occasions that we have to be more up-front in our relations with Taiwan, and it is still of concern to me that our somewhat unsatisfactory treatment of Taiwan as a trade partner over previous years could discriminate against Australia in this new Taiwanese market. While the Taiwanese will be breaking down the legal barriers to entry to that market, there is no reason to believe that Australian exporters of rice or beef or anything else will get preferential treatment or even equal treatment as compared with our American competitors, because, while this nation and this Government refused to support Taiwan's entry to GATT, the Americans were supporting it with alacrity.

But there is a lot more that this Government must do in terms of international relations, especially with countries like Taiwan, and especially in its trade relations with our other neighbours in South East Asiaâ€”such as Malaysia. Even though we are the most efficient producers, the Government must ensure that we are not discriminated against and must ensure that our producers get a fair go on the international market.

The Government recognised at that time that we would be in difficulty with unemployment for a period and that the position would rectify itself or improve in the second half of this financial year. That is the position I have put on behalf of the Government on numerous occasions here and of which Senator Hill is quite aware.

         â€”I would have thought Senator Panizza, as a grain farmer, would have been pleased about this. The Australian Wheat Board recently publicised its assessment of the benefit to the grain industry flowing from these reforms and the industry's complementary investment in labour saving technology. I think it is important to place this on the public record of the Parliament.

         Some of the gains listed by the Australian Wheat Board include a 50 per cent reduction in the cost of grain stevedoring nationally and a reduction of 70 per cent of the work force in grain terminals. Since 1988-89 the time taken to turn around grain vessels at Australian ports has been cut in half. This is the average figure, and the Australian Wheat Board describes the improvements at some ports as being more spectacular. For example, it cites Newcastle, where ship turnaround time has gone from five days to 1.6 days. The overall savings to the industry are estimated currently to be at least $10m annually.

         The Wheat Board's Managing Director, John Lawrenson, comments that these excellent results are a direct benefit of the industry's constructive participation in the reform process. Instead of sitting on the sidelines and abusing the waterfront parties, as Mr Sharp continues to do, the AWB was prepared to cooperate with them and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority in the direct negotiation of the changes. I have given the Wheat Board public credit for this before.

         This will obviously cause the shadow Minister for shipping and the Opposition a great deal of heartburn, given their reaction to the improvements in waterfront reform, which they have just responded to by continued carping criticism. I conclude by quoting the Australian Wheat Board's public statement. It said, `Australian ports are now among the most efficient grain loading ports in the world'.

Secondly, as the report indicates that many projects are still in the feasibility stage, how many realistically will get off the ground in the next 12 months and how many jobs will be created?

It would certainly not work if Ministers were swamped with proposals from a variety of small businesses around Australia; and it certainly would not work if Ministers were swamped with businesses throughout Australia contemplating investments of $80m or $90m.

         The process is concerned essentially about major projects in the resource processing industries. All of those involve substantial investments of undoubtedly in excess of $100m. In terms of smaller companies, to make it a workable system it has to be confined to larger investments.

It is, of course, too early to say that. We have tried to set up a process which will facilitate some of these things. If that process is helpful in facilitation, a significant number of projects could well go ahead. I am unable to say what the employment implications of those projects will be, except to say that in the construction phase the employment implications are usually significant; in the longer term, direct employment in these projects is not very high. The indirect employment, of course, is very significant in terms of service industries of one kind or anotherâ€”transport industries and things of that kind.

         The EIS itself contains a comprehensive evaluation of the alternatives to the Government's strategy of construction of the third runway and the staged development of Badgerys Creek. The EIS clearly shows that this strategy results in the most cost-effective provision of airport capacity in terms of construction costs per passenger; lower airport construction costs in net present value terms than the Badgerys Creek alternatives; and a reduction of average annual delays at Kingsford-Smith Airport by a total of 127,000 hours, resulting in savings to airline operators and, therefore, their passengers of around $640m per annum. An amount of $320m for the construction of the third runway and associated work will be needed to get this benefit. I stress that again: a construction cost of $320m and annual savings to the industry and, therefore, the flying public of $640m. That is not a bad investment.

         The supplement also reviewed the Coopers and Lybrand cost-benefit comparison between the third runway and a substantial domestic airport at Badgerys Creek, prepared as part of the airport coordinating task force submission to the draft EIS. The review found that there was a net benefit of over $1 billion in favour of the third runway, as compared with $17m found by the Coopers and Lybrand study. Moreover, this review included an assessment of loss of social amenity due to aircraft noise and found a noise cost penalty of $98m for the immediate construction of a domestic airport at Badgerys Creek.

         The EIS demonstrates that an airport at Badgerys Creek is unlikely to be commercially viable, as I have said before, until 2005 to 2010. Consequently, the immediate development of a regular public transport airport would need to be funded by the Australian taxpayer. In contrast, the third runway has been assessed by the FAC to be a commercially viable proposition on the basis of its own investment criteria and would be totally funded in a normal commercial manner by the FAC.

Since 1987, however, UNIDO has established a reputation for the efficient and effective delivery of development programs and it has implemented and committed itself to a policy of zero real growth budgets.

         In the 1991-92 Budget context, the Government accordingly reconsidered the question of our membership and was able to announce an allocation of funds to resume membership from 1 January 1992. This decision and the rejoining of UNIDO will complement Australia's foreign policy and our economic and trade objectives as well. Specifically, it will reaffirm our strong commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation for development; it will reinforce the Government's industry policy objectives to increase efficiency, international competitiveness and the export orientation of Australian manufacturing industries; and it will enable Australia to influence industry development strategies, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

         The Government is well aware that exposure to synthetic mineral fibre, which includes fibreglass, can be a significant occupational health and safety issue. As a result of the concerns raised in Australia in 1987 regarding such products, Worksafe Australia commissioned a comprehensive expert review on the degree of worker exposure to these products and the health effects which may arise from such exposures. Following consideration of this report, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission declared a national exposure standard of 0.5 respirable fibres per millilitre of air for all forms of synthetic mineral fibre. This standard is the most stringent standard for this product anywhere in the world.

         Mr Munson's claim that fibreglass is as lethal as asbestos was reported in the media earlier this year as a result of his previous visit to Australia in June. In response to those claims, on 3 July Worksafe convened a forum of independent experts to address concerns associated with the use of fibreglass in Australia. The experts unanimously concluded that any allegation that fibreglass is as lethal as asbestos is wrong, misleading and likely to cause undue anxiety in the community. They also said that, provided handling procedures as outlined in the code are followed, there is no risk to health from the use of fibreglass.

         In terms of whether the Prime Minister was only offering the rhetoric of change, the Government's environment record since 1983 speaks for itself. It is second to none. It involves saving a range of resources from rainforests in north Queensland and wild rivers and 400-year-old trees in Tasmania to the stunning beauty of places like Shark Bay. Every single decision was opposed by those opposite. As far as I am concerned, I welcome anyone who wants to examine the record of this Government on the environment and who wants to compare it with that of the Opposition because the contrast will be stark. For those who are interested, let me say that during last night's speech I referred to one thing, and that was the enemy being the same enemy.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and deals with the latest unemployment figures and the maintenance of standards of living. Has the Minister seen the latest unemployment figures, which indicate that the number of discouraged job seekers has risen and that the number of people looking for work has fallen, mainly because of women giving up the search for part time jobs? Has the Minister seen a report earlier this year of a study by researchers at Flinders University where one researcher, Dr Travers, indicated that real wages have declined so that people are working harder for less by virtue of the fact that the spouse has had to get an income to make ends meet? Do the latest figures mean that the recession is hitting hardest those women in those families? What will the Government do to redress that situation?

If one needs to identify a policy which opens the door to exploitation of ordinary Australian workers, that is, indeed, the policy that will do it. One of the problems with the policy is that Mr Howard has never actually made a full statement of all the details of it. He constantly tells us that this is a prime and key Opposition policy; that this is a policy that sets the Opposition apart from the Government; but he has never declared, and still declines to declare, what exactly that policy is.

         One can only believe that he has taken a leaf from the book of the Leader of the Opposition who, at the National Press Club recently, said that it is his preference to declare these things at the eleventh hour. Therefore, I imagine that this distinctly different policy may be visited upon the electorate at the eleventh hour, just before the election, so that no-one in the field of industrial relations or the wider community can look at a comprehensive declaration of policy from the Opposition. If it is so good and if it is so different I say to Mr Howard, `Let us see it. Stop hiding your light under a bushel. Stop hiding behind platitudes. Stop hiding behind homilies. Stop hiding behind anonymous and unproven examples'. What we do know from what Mr Howard says is thatâ€”

         It is a form of bargaining which the Opposition and the New Zealand Government hold to be fair in which an employer negotiates directly with a single employee for a so-called voluntary employment contract. One can hardly say that this is a meeting of equals. The bargaining power of the employee versus that of an employerâ€”particularly in times of high unemployment like nowâ€”is hardly an example of fair dealing and, in fact, is an example of inviting exploitation.

The present position is that the United States Government and the Australian Government have been negotiating over the transition from American to Australian control of the North West Cape. The most recent set of negotiations was completed some time in October. It is expected that in the near future there will be an exchange of letters between Secretary Chaney and me to finalise that agreement. Initially that was to have been signed at the Ausmin talks. Then we had the Bush visit substituted for the Ausmin talks, and Senator Crichton-Browne would realise that at the moment there is no formal process in that sense.

         The funding for the North West Cape will come out of the existing defence budget. I cannot give an absolutely accurate total of running costs currently because the US picks up a fair bit of it, and the way it breaks up its programs makes it impossible to put a total running cost on it. I would expect that an Australian operation would be cheaper, but we have yet to determine whether we will be contracting out a lot of those functions to civilians. Until we make that decision I cannot give a figure for future running costs.

         The honourable senator also asked about the consequences for housing. We cannot go to those consequences until we establish staffing levels and determine how many will be civilian and how many will be military. Also, wherever possible we are keeping our eye, from a defence point of view, on any other projects in the areaâ€”there are one or two floating aroundâ€”that continue to see the expansion of the township. It would be a matter of concern to the locals that, with the Americans moving out and vacating a number of housesâ€”I am not sure how many, but certainly scores of housesâ€”this could have a depressing effect on the property market. We will keep that in mind. Indeed, though, if we do contract out it will mean more civilians being employed who, presumably, can take up the housing opportunities in the area.

Once the exchange of letters occurs, I will make a statementâ€”I think it will be a parliamentary statement in this caseâ€”as to the terms and conditions.

         â€”Following a question yesterday from Senator O'Chee, I have a supplementary answer. The honourable senator asked me whether I had received any communication from the Consul-General in Shanghai about Senator Burns's discussion with a journalist on the subject of Tiananmen Square and, if so, whether I would table that communication. I am able to inform the honourable senator that a cable was received last Friday, 1 November. Having regard to freedom of information principles, I am prepared to table that cable, and I do so now.

         Let me add this in further elaboration of the answer: Senator O'Chee was quite wrong in claiming, as he did in a press release issued on Tuesday which I have only just seen, that as a result of this communication from Shanghai, or indeed any other communication, I or my office knew of the alleged comments by Senator Burns before publication of the article in question, which appeared last Friday, 1 November. The first that I or my office knew of any discussion between Senator Burns and the journalist in question was after the fact, after the publication of the article in question, when the story in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Courier-Mail

         had been faxed to my office, later on the day of publication.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What happened then was that my office made a quick check by telephone with the Australian Consul-General in Shanghai to see whether he had any further information, in Senator Burns's continued absence from Australia, as to what the true story of the report may have been. My office was informed that a conversation between Senator Burns and the journalist had taken place at a reception at the Australian Consulate on 30 October, two days earlier. The Consul was unaware of the details of the conversation in question. The article was faxed to him by my office. He had a subsequent conversation with the journalist later that day, and also later that day the cable I am now tabling, confirming the substance of the conversation between my office and the Consul, was sent back to Canberra by the Consul.

         I repeat: for Senator O'Chee to claimâ€”and this seems to lie behind his question yesterdayâ€”that I somehow knew of these comments before they appeared in the press, which, by the way, Senator Burns has already said are not an accurate reflection of what he said, is to grossly distort the situation. There is nothing in the

          Hansard

         record that would give rise to the suggestion Senator O'Chee makes, nor is there any other factual foundation for it, and I suggest that it would be appropriate that he apologise.

        Substantially, this report deals with the operations of the Special Investigations Unit, which was set up by the Government and which has been investigating allegations of war crimes by residents in Australia for over four years. At the moment it has a funding guarantee from the Government until June next year, which will take this process through a period of five years.

         The situation is causing some concern, because it is clear that this has become a very extensive and expensive operation indeed. The total expenditure of the special investigations unit up to 30 June 1991 amounted to $11.381m. In the last year it spent some $3.8m, and presumably it will spend that amount again next year.

         It is not as though the matters that are referred to the Unit are running down, because it is reported here that in the current year, up to 30 June last, a further 137 suspects were referred to it. As at the end of 30 June 1991 there were reported to be 27 active investigations, which included the case that has now gone to trialâ€”the one and only case in all these years of investigations that has gone to trial. But there are 15 others, and it is certainly clear that some of them may well yet go to trial.

         The total cost of the Special Investigations Unit has been very great indeed. There are still large numbers of matters being referred to it. In addition, as I think we all know, the one and only case which was launched by the prosecution, went to the High Court which upheld the Act passed by the Senate at the end of 1988. The High Court upheld that Act and the prosecution case has now just commenced in Adelaide. Until that time there had been expended in costs by the Crown Prosecutor more than $300,000 and more than $600,000 in legal aid by the public defender acting for the defence. Because it was thought that the case might go to trial, the Director of Public Prosecutions was provided with $9.5m to conduct that case in the last financial year. However, only $300,000 was expended, largely because of the High Court proceedings. It is perfectly clear that the trial of that one case will be enormously expensive and any other trials are likely to be of the same order. These must be added, of course, to the very large costs of the special investigator to which I have just referred.

         Therefore, the operation of the War Crimes Act, as contained in the report, of which I have given a very brief summary, causes a good deal of concern and alarm as to how long this Unit will continue to operate and how many prosecutions will be launched, if indeed any further prosecutions are launched. This is, of course, apart from the one that is now under way. The experience of the difficulties of bringing the evidence before the courts in Australia will reveal whether it is possible, in these circumstances, to really launch prosecutions. I hope the Government will give very close attention to the question of whether it should continue with this exercise.

         â€”This report is essentially the work of the Special Investigations Unit which was established following the passage of the War Crimes Amendment Act 1988. In turn, this was the consequence of a report of Mr Menziesâ€”the so-called Menzies reportâ€”relating to the entry of suspected war criminals into Australia. The Director of the Unit is now Mr Blewitt who replaced the first Director, Mr Robert Greenwood, QC, who has since returned to private practice. The report confirms that the political changes sweeping Europe have directly affected the work of the Unit. While initially that work was interrupted on some occasions in Lithuania, Latvia, Yugoslavia and of course during the Gulf war, the investigators are now receiving more cooperation in countries where access to archives is now easier than it was before.

         I also note with interest that New Zealand has passed legislation to conduct a war crimes inquiry, and that two units have been established in the United Kingdom: one in England and Wales; and the second in Scotland, with separate jurisdictions. During the last year alone, the Unit has received allegations of some further 137 suspects. The allegations now total 242. An indication that the investigations are being carried out with some care and due diligence is that a large number of these cases are not being proceeded with simply because the basic elements and the information concerning the allegations provided cannot be substantiated.

         As at 30 June 1991, there remained 27 active investigations, including the case currently proceeding in Adelaide, of which 11, as the report says, are not promising and are likely to be suspended. The matter of cost has been raised by Senator Durack as being of concern. Whilst I appreciate that parliament must be accountable for every dollar spent, I believe the money spent in the current year, some $3.8m together with a further $325,000 spent by the Director of Public Prosecutions, is money extremely well spent.

         We are dealing here not with crimes of a normal kind. We are dealing here with a principle that this country needs to establishâ€”that war crimes are not crimes that we are in any way prepared to condone. War itself is something that will, hopefully, in due course become a thing of the past and naturally we will exert all efforts to achieve world peace. But if war does break out, if it is considered by those pursuing it that it is inevitable, then it is absolutely essential that it is conducted within civilised limits and that people who take advantage of the chaos or of power that accrues to them in these circumstances will be brought to justice. I believe the Nuremberg principle that was established, of individual responsibility, must be pursued. We are dealing in these matters not with people who are simply cogs in a machine, but people who committed acts on their own initiative and with a degree of persistence.

         The other argument that is often advanced is the length of time that has elapsed, and certainly we have reason to question why it took us so long to establish this Unit when the initial War Crimes Act was passed in 1945. This is a matter for criticism of successive governments: it is not a reason for not doing anything at the moment.

         In the five minutes allotted to me, I shall deal with four of the matters mentioned in the report. Although the Australian Fisheries Council meeting was held in Wellington, New Zealand, and was attended by 30 to 40 people, it is no wonder that the fishing industry is in such a mess considering the number of issues that are under discussion and the state of inactivity. The Council appears to float issues along from one meeting to the next and then work out where the next meeting will be held.

          The first important matter is the importation of goldfish. Frankly, I cannot accept the attitude of AQIS that the acceptable level of risk is `reasonable'. There is either a risk or there is not. If there is a risk, the answer is no, they should not be imported. All the report says is, `Insufficient evidence is available to justify a ban on defensible quarantine grounds'. If there is a risk, that is a ground of defensible risk.

          The second matter is aquiculture. Apparently, the Australian Fisheries Council is still doing very little. But the report says, `Council NOTED the progress in the development of a National Strategy on Aquaculture'. At this stage, with aquiculture having grown in Australia for as many years as it has, it is pathetic to be still trying to work on the development of a national strategy. Surely, we can find enough people in the various departments at the State and Federal levels to do something about it now.

          The third matter is that of recreational fishing. About a week ago I went to a national conference of recreational fishermen. I can certainly advise the Federal Government and the State governments that the recreational fishermen are years ahead of government when it comes to looking at the issues, assessing them and seeing what the future holds in store. I found them to be very much unanimous in their views and very well organised. I expect them to be moving to assist in the management of the Australian fishing industry and fishing generally to a much higher extent in the next months, I would hope, certainly not years.

          â€”I am pleased to hear the remarks of Senator Archer because I agree entirely with what he has said. We have in front of us a document which records a meeting in New Zealand of the Australian Fisheries Council, of which the Minister for Fisheries in New Zealand was merely an observer. If there is an example of waste of financial resources, taking this vast number of people to New Zealand to swan aroundâ€”I use the word quite deliberatelyâ€”and simply `note' this and `note' that, and that is what the report says all the way through, and a Council which is supposed to be keeping an overview of an industry which is in dire straits with species after species heading towards extinction, certainly heading towards closure of large numbers of fisheries for very long periods of time if those fisheries are to recover at all, then the process we have described in this report is totally inadequate.

          I note that the Australian Fisheries Council is made up of the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the State Ministers. If this report indicates their level of concern, then it goes some way to explain why so little is being done in relation to this very important industry which is in such terrible straits. Just to take one example, Senator Archer mentioned the importation of goldfish, which undoubtedly are capable of carrying, and undoubtedly do carry, diseases.

          I agree entirely with Senator Archer that the risk of the importation of these diseases into this country should be a sufficient reason. There are no good reasons why goldfish need to be imported at all, particularly if they pose a threat to such an important indigenous industry.

         A species which in the four or five years since it has been exploited has been pushed rapidly virtually to extinction in every area where that exploitation has gone on, yet here we have the Federal and State Ministers responsible simply noting the outcome of consultations and acknowledging a contribution made by Australia. This is a fishery which Australia moved into with totally inadequate knowledge of the life cycle of these fish and the great ageâ€”roughly 37 yearsâ€”that they have to achieve before they get to sexual maturity. Australia moved in and grossly exploited them, yet the Australian Fisheries Council can merely `note' this and `note' that.

          So it goes on with the other items. The southern bluefin tuna is another fishery stock which is certainly under excessive pressure and inadequately managed, and again we have the statement that Council simply `noted' a common desire to manage these. What we want in these reports is some more positive indication of how that management will be carried out. Presumably, this Council can make some decisions which would come back and be reflected in legislation.

          In relation to driftnet fishing, the Council noted the imminent introduction of the package of legislation that we dealt with a few weeks ago in this place. It noted that New Zealand had ratified the international convention on driftnet fishing. It did not even bother to note that New Zealand had authorised a much more stringent driftnet fishing code than that in the international agreement. Clearly, that was an important lesson for Australia to pick up and, indeed, has been picked up in the legislation which we passed a few weeks ago.

          The reason I want to say a few words on this report is that, following a question I asked Senator Button today, it seems to me ridiculous that the Government in its wisdom has spent $16m on building a research vessel for the CSIRO so that it can investigate such things as the orange roughy fishery and other potential fisheries around Australiaâ€”not just around Tasmaniaâ€”yet because of the lack of funding that vessel will be laid up in Hobart for the next year. This is happening for the sake of a million or so dollars. It is not just the money that counts but the timing. We will waste a year's valuable research time, which could be spent very profitably in investigating other areas of potential fishing grounds in Tasmania and other parts of Australia.

          Senator Archer's friends from the north-west coast, the Rockliffs, found the original orange roughy fishery in that area. It has been a question of hit or miss and, as Senator Coulter said, no-one really knows that much about orange roughy. All that is known is that for some reason or other they come together when they are 50 years old, which is when they are caught. Unless we can research these fisheries, how can we keep our fishery industry goingâ€”an industry that is so important to all of Australia but particularly to Tasmania? I find it quite incredible that we have a modern up-to-date fishing research vessel just sitting tied up in the dock in Hobart.

It seems that some of the Russian fishing vessels may be coming to Tasmania from the Nakhodka Cooperative. We also had discussions with Professor Ernst Nosov, who spent 15 years not only with Russian research vessels but also working with the New Zealand Government. He has a great deal of knowledge of fishery areas around the continental shelf of Tasmania. I have been trying for the past year to arrange for him to visit Australia. I think he is coming on 14 November, but the communication difficulties with the Soviet Union have to be tried to be understood. It is incredibly difficult, and indeed almost impossible, to try to get phone calls and faxes through to Vladivostok. I hope that next week I will be able to take Professor Nosov and two colleagues to the CSIRO establishment in Hobart, where they are most keen to talk to him about the research he has done. The fishing industry is crying out for research and knowledge of our fish resource. When we know what the resource is, the Government will be able to take the appropriate steps to ensure that it is protected.

          However, I wish to take the opportunity to set down the framework of the concerns of the Australian Democrats in the area of overseas aid. I think it is important for us to be aware of the dimensions of the worldwide crisis. More than a billion peopleâ€”one in every fiveâ€”still live at this stage in absolute poverty. They struggle to live on less than about $500 a year, and most live in Asia and Africa. One in six people in developing countries still go hungry every day and one in three children under five suffer from serious malnutrition. The 40,000 children who die every day from preventable causes could be saved if the world gave the matter some priority.

          While the West alone spent a billion United States dollars in two days on the Gulf war, the same amount spent over a year would have saved children dying from three diseasesâ€”measles, tetanus and polio. Some 50,000 children died from these diseases in the first week of the war. Poverty is the silent killer, attracting no media attention but inflicting as much grief and human suffering as more headline-grabbing tragedies. For this reason, the Australian Democrats' alternative Budget proposes an increase of some $340m for overseas aid, together with an additional $65m for the saving of rainforests the world over, because clearly care for the environment is part of the objectives of overseas aid.

          It is useful to compare the situation between the rich countries and the developing countries in terms of the benefits in trade that we, as a country, receive. While we give just over $1 billion in aid, we receive some $13 billion in return from trade with developing countries. They contribute around $13 billion a year to our well-being. What is more, since some 85 per cent of the aid is actually spent on Australian supplies and consultants, our `generosity' is certainly open to question.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is instructive to pay some attention to the level of overseas aid that Australia supplies. Since the Hawke Government came to power in 1983 Australian aid to developing countries has been cut. Aid has fallen from 0.51 per cent of gross national product to 0.33 per cent of GNP. Australia's aid is the same dollar value, allowing for inflation, as it was 20 years ago. Yet our per capita income is now at least 20 per cent higher. We have not become poorer as a nation, just a lot meaner.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In 1990-91, as I have said, the level remained at 0.33 per cent of GNP. But there were also real cuts of about $100m and, because payments to the international banks were large, other parts of the program have suffered. There has been a cut of about 7 per cent across most areas. It is instructive to look at some of these cuts. South Asia received a cut of 33 per cent which affected projects in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan. In sub-Saharan Africa there have been cuts of 61 per cent. A major food project for workland rehabilitation and reafforestation has had to end. There have been cuts of 24 per cent in Ethiopia and cuts of 8 per cent to non-government organisations.

          This is not a proud record for Australia.

          There are many arguments why Australia should reverse the current trend and increase its aid. The first, and perhaps the most obvious, is the moral argumentâ€”the gap between the rich and the poor. The second is the international comparison argument. Norway contributes 1.02 per cent of GNP; Denmark one per cent; Sweden 1.98 per cent; France 0.79 per cent; Germany 0.41 per cent; and Italy 0.39 per cent. We are just about at the bottom of the ladder with 0.33 per cent.

          There is the community support argument. Australians are generous people. Some two million people every year give to overseas aid programs which are run by non-government organisations. I believe that the Government should take some note of the will of the Australian people to assist those all over the world who have less. There is the mutual benefit argument, which I adverted to before, that if developing countries are receiving aid to enable them to run a stronger economy they in turn will be trading with Australia. There is the environmental development argument, which I have also mentioned before, that only countries which can satisfy the material needs of their people can set aside resources to save the environment and to ensure that their ecology is put on a sustainable level.

          â€”As somebody with a keen interest in our relations with China, I note that the annual report on the Australia-China Council has been tabled. In particular, I note the objectives and priorities of the Australia-China Council, which are to develop further relations between Australia and China. The report says that the Council does this through the promotion in Australia of a greater awareness of China and the promotion in China of a greater awareness of Australia. The ultimate goal, of course, is to improve our relations with China.

          At the moment I am concerned that there are matters which still cloud the Australian relationship with China. Today Senator Gareth Evans tabled in the Senateâ€”I thank him for doing soâ€”a copy of a cable in respect of comments made by Senator Burns about the Tiananmen Square massacre. In tabling this document, Senator Evans suggested that he had been misrepresented in my press release on Tuesday in which I noted that it was disappointing that Senator Evans could have advance warning of the article that was written, an article in which Senator Burns was reported to have said that the response of the Chinese Government in carrying out the Tiananmen Square massacre was a reasonable one.

I am pointing out that what we have seen is untrue, that Senator Evans knew in advance of the story being written, yet Senator Evans comes into this chamber today and says he did not.

According to the statements that Senator Tambling and I heard Senator Burns express publicly, there is no doubt that the inference was one of sympathy towards the Chinese Government in respect of Tiananmen Square. Had there been more journalist exchangesâ€”this report notes that there were not enoughâ€”Senator Burns would have been more alert to the danger of making asinine statements which cannot, and will not, have the support of this Opposition.

He was critical of his own Government's reaction to Tiananmen Square. It may have been useful if we had had more journalists, or even a journalist, in attendance from the very beginning.

The motives of the Government members in that situation are a disgrace. It is particularly disgraceful for them to try to stop a member of this place with a Chinese background discussing a matter which is of major importance to him and to the community, which is no doubt very proud to have him representing it. I believe the Government's behaviour has been as appalling as Senator Burns's behaviour, which it has been prepared to accept without criticism. Where is Senator Evans's criticism of Senator Burns?

          The cleavage between the Chinese people and their Communist rulers, purchased at such a price by the people, clarifies much. When the Communist party chief Jiang Zemin describes the conflict over democratization as "a serious class struggle that concerns the life and death of our party, state and nation," we recognize the class of democratic activists with whom his party struggles. When he voices optimism about the outcome and predicts a "bright Communist future for mankind," we are able to get a second opinion from Chinese dissidents. And when he maintains that the socialist system is superior, and attributes China's continuing poverty solely to the size of its population, we recognize this for what it is: An attempt to blame the talented and industrious Chinese people for the failures of the party and system that he heads.

          Jiang's claims, which in the recent past would have been taken seriously, can now be easily dismissed on the authority of Chinese dissidents, who regard Marxism as a nineteenth-century fallacy propounded by geriatric rulers supported by a sclerotic bureaucracy.

        By the turn of the century Australia must have a vocational education and training system that meets the needs of people and of industry better than the system that we have today.

       <para>
        The document advocates freedom of movement between schools, TAFE, industry, universities and training programs, but TAFE most of all must respond to industry and social needs. The whole thrust of this document is to highlight the enormous importance of TAFE institutions for education and training in Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Most honourable senators will be aware of the importance of TAFE. TAFE is the principal provider of post-secondary training opportunities for adults; TAFE provides vocational opportunities for a high proportion of our work force; TAFE caters for adults whose basic education has been inadequate; and TAFE retrains our workers and especially caters for individuals who do not receive training on the job.

         Since we all agree on the importance of the TAFE sector, honourable senators may be disturbed to learn that this vital sector of education is in a critical condition. To 1987 there had been a steady growth in the participation in TAFE. However, in 1988 participation in TAFE began to fall and has continued to fall every year since then. The report indicates that this decline is the result of recurrent funding restrictions.

         This document refers to the Deveson committee report entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Training Costs of Award Restructuring
         </emphasis>
         . I remind the Senate that the report concludes that the Government's attitudes to resourcing TAFE are anomalous and unsatisfactory. The Deveson committee was concerned that the TAFE system lacked the capacity to meet not only the demands that are currently facing it but also training demands required as a result of award restructuring. Governments have recognised and accepted the need for funding of schools beyond post-compulsory secondary years and they have also accepted the need for additional funds for tertiary places in universities and how TAFE has not been so favoured.

         In my own State of New South Wales, it has been estimated that next year TAFE may turn away up to 90,000 students because of budgetary constraints. The managing director of TAFE in New South Wales, Dr Gregor Ramsey, is concerned about the imbalance of resources available to universities and TAFE. For instance, he says that universities are training too many teachers and that we cannot employ all the teachers that we produce. On the other hand, TAFE cannot train technicians that are needed for trade courses. He says the problem is that training teachers is controlled by the Federal Government but training plumbers and electronics technicians in the States is under the control of the State governments, which have a lack of income.

         This document recognises the problem and urges the Government to implement as a matter of urgency the recommendations of the Deveson committee for real term increases in TAFE recurrent funding of 5 per cent per annum. It also urges governments to redress the unequal treatment received by TAFE compared to schools and universities.

         The document is particularly critical of the Government that has paid so little attention to funding issues raised by the Deveson committee report. It is sadly just another example of how this Government believes that it only has to set up committees to solve the nation's problems and does not have to take any notice of the findings and recommendations. This document also calls for governments to set targets for improving TAFE participation, since this has been done for school retention rates and higher education places. It also urges the Government to set targets for young people to achieve recognised skills as they enter the work force.

        â€”At the conclusion of the allotted time for debate on this matter on 17 October I was at the point of congratulating Senator Boswell for making moves to make it a little easier for our rural sectorâ€”our producersâ€”to challenge whether produce was being dumped in Australia. Senator Boswell's efforts in that regard have been well publicised and I certainly wish him success in continuing to fight that fight on behalf of our rural producers. It is a pity that more assistance is not being given to him through models or examples which our Government could adopt. It seems so much easier for other countries to keep out items of trade which are suspected of being dumped on their domestic markets. The fact is that it seems easier for everybody else in the world to assist their rural producers than it is for us.

        I was heading towards the conclusion of my remarks at the time that debate was interrupted. I had already pointed out that the Democrats agree with the general direction of Senator Panizza's motion, which contends that the Government has failed to provide direction for the rural sector. We would certainly agree with that. As a matter of fact, I would like to repeat my analogy, because it has not been challenged. My analogy showed that the control that is being exercised over our economy and over guidance in the rural sector is very much one of deregulation, hands off and non-intervention. The analogy that I drew at that time was that it was very much like a boy on a bike, riding downhill with his hands off and calling out, `Look, Mum, no hands'. It seems to me to be a most appropriate analogy for what is happening with our economy and the Government's degree of intervention on behalf of the rural sector.

        The trouble is that much of this philosophy has been endorsed by the coalition. It is ironic that we see here today this particular motion by Senator Panizza from a group which has supported the deregulationist, economic rationalist model. The irony is one which, if it was not so serious with regard to the rural sector, I would like to spend some time exploring, but I will not.

        I would like to point out that another philosophy associated with that is the one which we are constantly told Australia and the rest of the world should head towards. It is the one of the free trade concept which is, essentially, nonsense. That is why the Democrats will be moving an amendment to this motion.

       We move that amendment because, in essence, those words describe free trade, which we believe is a nonsense, because all trade throughout the world at the moment is distorted by the very fact that governments exist.

        We contend that the very fact that governments exist and that they collect taxes and provide infrastructure does distort trade. Governments provide not only infrastructure in the form of physical infrastructure, but also community defence, law and order, education, public health, support for the arts, recreation and communication systems. We know what governments do, but every act they engage in is an act of support for the activities within their countries. It is the vehicle by which trade and productivity occurs within those countries and some countries place different priorities on different sections of it. Therefore, some industries or activities within nations receive greater support than they do in other countries. That is the distortion of trade. That is why the concept of free trade is a nonsense in our present world.

        On the other hand, if a government abandons all of its responsibilities in these areas, it is no longer a government. Only then can it be truthfully claimed that we have free tradeâ€”total laissez faire, the hands off the bike completely. That would be the only situation where there would be no support for production, whether it be primary, secondary or tertiary production. Only then could we truthfully argue that there are no government subsidies for production.

Those industries are suffering greatest at the hands of this silly notion that we should lead the worldâ€”lead with our chinâ€”by telling the world that we will abandon all government subsidies and support and that we want the rest of the world to follow our example.

        An example which is quite easily digestible, even by the coalition at the moment, is that provided by Australia's wool industry. On this very day we are at a point on the roller-coaster ride of wool prices that has been delivered to us with great uncertainty and a total lack of predictability. Anybody who can predict what the average indicative price, or any other price, for wool will be at our next wool sale, will be much cleverer than any of the other predictors who have preceded us over the last few months. They have all failed. Nobody has been able to predict what our prices have been.

        It is claimed that our wool market is of such a size that it is beyond speculation or manipulation. I would suggest that that is very far from the truth and that the situation it is in at the moment means that it is subjected to speculation, innuendo, gossip, rumour, fashion and a number of other things, over which Australia has no control whatsoever. One of the paths to resolution of that problem would be the reintroduction of our wool futures arrangement, whereby producers could at least hedge to some extent against market fluctuations. Obviously, that would not provide a total answer. I suggest that those proponents of a totally free marketing system would do well to observe the wool prices of the past few months, which have been the cause of extreme financial hardship to those people who have tried to predict and to judge the most appropriate time to put their wool onto our markets.

So much for the idea of liberalising trade. That is the justification for the Democrats' amendment. With the words removed as sought, we would be prepared to support the motion.

        I mentioned the irony of this motion being moved by the coalition, and I also see a great deal of irony in what has transpired between the time when the motion was first moved and the debate that is occurring today. It was some months ago that an opportunity first presented itself for the coalition itself to provide some support and direction to Australia's rural community. The first opportunity was when the Democrats moved for the removal of the assets test from the Austudy scheme. To say that I was disappointed is the polite way to describe my reactions. I will stay with that description, but I must say that my reactions were stronger than that. A couple of days ago in one of our daily newspapers we saw the headline `Libs offer to ease Austudy assets test'. The article went on to state:

      <para>
       That was in regard to Austudy. What disgusted me about this is that that opportunity was presented to the coalition several months ago, when all it had to do was to support the Democrats notice of motion to disallow the regulation which imposed an assets test on the Austudy scheme. That opportunity sailed past the coalition and was not taken advantage of, and now we have the proposition that at some stage in the future a coalition government would support that very notion. I find this hypocritical to say the least, and certainly it is misleading to our rural community. Notwithstanding the irony in this motion, I think the best thing we can do is to support it, if our amendment is successful.

        â€”I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Senator Panizza's motion on the Government's failure to provide direction and support to Australia's depressed rural sector. The Government has paid too little attention to the difficulties being experienced in our rural and regional areas. There is no denying that, isolated as we are in Canberra, we fail to pay more than lip service to the real tragedy in the rural areas. I do not know how many honourable senators had the opportunity a few weeks ago to meet with members from the Isolated Children's and Parents' Association. They are the face of rural Australia. It is those people and others just like them that this Federal Government has ignored and has failed. I have often spoken both inside and outside this place in recent weeks on the rural crisis and on the twin evils of commodity collapse and drought and the Federal Government's inertia. In fact, I believe it is just outright scornful neglect for the rural sector of Australia. Let me establish the extent of the problem.

        Farm incomes this year will drop to an historic new low. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predicts that farm incomes will fall 24 per cent this year, and this follows the 34 per cent slide last financial year. For wool and summer crops, the outlook is absolutely bleak. Wool prices fell to their lowest level this century just recently and then rose again. Last month the ABARE predicted a 34 per cent drop, but it may well have to revise downwards some of its predictions. It is predicted that income from rice will drop 22 per cent and that sugar income will drop some 13 per cent. These are the lowest recorded farm incomes in real terms ever, and go beyond the figures for the period of drought in 1982-83, which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) claims was the time of our worst recession.

        The ABARE annual farm survey is specific in its depressing outlook in its report. It has suggested, for example, that 50 per cent of sheep properties will have negative incomes and that another 25 per cent will have incomes below $13,000. Twenty-five per cent of beef properties, supposedly in comparative terms doing well, will have negative incomes, and another 25 per cent will have incomes below $10,900. In fact, across every sort of farming activity the ABARE predicts negative incomes for 25 per cent of all farms. Yet the Prime Minister suggests that this recession is not as bad as people believe, and in any case we are pulling out of it. Obviously, he must be pulling out of a different place from where the farmers are.

        The data from one of his own Government departments clearly suggests that at least for the duration of this financial year a quarter of our farm sector will have negative incomes. This is a sector which traditionally has provided the bulk of our export income. I am pleased that at least the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has now acknowledged the seriousness of the problem and has admitted that Australia is facing its worst recession for 60-odd years. Despite all that, and despite the fact that in New South Wales and Queensland thousands of properties have been drought declared, with no feed, no crops and no prospect of anything growing for at least the next five months, even if it rains, the Federal Government is still just reviewing the matter.

        Indeed, it was some 18 months ago that the Government's drought task force made its first report, yet today we are still waiting for a national drought strategy, although we have now been told by the Minister that at the end of February we will indeed have a national drought strategy. The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, on which Senator Crane, Senator Calvert and I represent this side of the chamber, and of which Senator Bell is also a memberâ€”and I note that Senator Bell is in the chamber at the momentâ€”is looking at drought strategies and the drought problems and will report by the first sitting day in February. Hopefully, that will help the Federal Minister and the State Ministers at the Australian Agricultural Council meeting, which is to be held at the end of February, to formulate a proper drought policy and strategy for the future. At the moment, farmers do not quite know how they are placed in relation to drought assistance.

        The Government suggested that the new part D, that was added to the rural adjustment scheme so that farmers would be able to receive the equivalent of unemployment benefits, would be of great help. The strategy committee suggested this, but even when that comes out, farmers will still be unable to receive unemployment benefits because they cannot meet the work test requirements. I mentioned that in this place recently. They cannot meet the work test requirements if they are back on the farm still trying to keep it viable. So, right across Australia there are farmers who have no money on which to live. Last week five very concerned people from an area regarded as one of the best and most prosperous farming districts in this country came into my electorate office in Tamworth with requests for assistance. I would hate to imagine what is happening in electorate offices in Dubbo and Broken Hill. The only activity in some of the western areas is wool growing. What is happening to these people and what help can they get? Obviously people in those areas are faced with worry and despair.

        Recent newspaper reports suggest that up to 20,000 farmers will leave their properties in the next 12 months. I am told that in the area of north-west New South Wales, from the top north-west corner of the central tablelands to the far north-west, there will be 25 to 30 per cent of farmers walking off their farms. What will they walk off with? They will walk off with their furniture or what they can load onto their cars or trucks. They will receive nothing for the sale of their land because interest rates have wiped out any equity they might have had. I do not believe that farmers look for handouts or charity. They just want an understanding by people in this Parliament of what is happening out there. They want to be able to do what they do best: grow wool, crops and beef. But they must be given a fair go and allowed to get on with the job of doing it. It is good to see the Minister for Industrial Relations sitting in the chamber because he used to deal with primary industries matters in this chamber.

It is of great concern to us on this side of the chamber. I am sorry I did not know that he was representing primary industries in this chamber; perhaps that shows that at the moment there is not enough effort and drive from the Minister's side of the chamber. If we do not keep the breeding herd and the sheep flock intact so that they will be there in some small measure after the drought has finished, obviously we will not be able to get out of the drought in the best way we could. I know that in the 1982-83 drought we had a very generous package from the Fraser-Anthony Government, of which Senator Durack, who is in the chamber at the moment, was a part. This made sure that breeding flocks and herds were retained so that when the drought broke the farming communities actually bounced back to produce the export income that was so necessary.

I think that is great, but now we face some other problems: dismal productivity and centralised wage fixing which has knocked us for six. All of this has resulted in an economy which has to pay $16 billion a year or 20 per cent of its own export income to service its foreign debt.

It is all right to say that interest rates are coming down very well now and therefore everything is good, that we have had the right policies in place to bring interest rates down. The problem isâ€”and I have said this to people in this place over the past three yearsâ€”that the high interest rates have now impacted on our input costs in running our farms, our properties and our businesses.

I hasten to add that many of the small businesses, as well as pastoral houses and their employees, in the metropolitan areas are also greatly affected by this recession or depression that we now have in Australia.

        I particularly mention the grain handling charges that are levied by the New South Wales Liberal Government. My understanding is that they are levied by the Grain Elevators Board in New South Wales. If this is the case, it is up to the people involved to make sure that the Grain Elevators Board addresses the inefficiencies. It will never be able to address those inefficiencies unless the industrial system in this country is properly reformed, and I will deal with that matter in a moment or two. I emphasise that the industrial relations system must be properly reformed.

        If we are talking about State governments and what they do, let us turn to my own State Government, the Lawrence Government, which recently placed another $45 on third party insurance for all vehicles in Western Australia. That particular charge has an enormous impact on rural Australia. The impact extends far beyond people who live in the cities or who are employed in a particular position. It is applied not only to the family car but also to the trucks, utilities, and other vehicles required to run business operations, and also to tractors, if one happens to have two properties that are separate. In many instances the owners of those properties have to pay eight lots of $45 because of the indiscretions of the current Government in Western Australia with regard to WA Inc., the SGIC and its misplaced investments. Of course, there are many winners out of that, but not the people Senator Panizza is addressing in his motion.

We have recently seen some changes there. Those funds come from the pockets of the taxpayers. There is one thing in the financial arena that this Government could do tomorrow which would have a very beneficial impact on many of those business operations, whether they be farmers, small businesses or regional businesses, and that is to free up the credit lines available to the Commonwealth Development Bank.

        Yesterday interest rates were again lowered. We can get commercial bills at about 9 per cent, with about a 2 per cent margin on top of thatâ€”about 11 per cent. Yet the Commonwealth Development Bank, because it does not have access to commercial bill lines, swap line facilities and financial facilities that other banks have, still has to charge between 16 per cent and 18 per cent to stay in the marketplace. That is one area where action could be taken.

        It is particularly important in my State of Western Australia because in excess of 35 per cent of total borrowings are held with the Commonwealth Development Bank. When those borrowings were taken out, the position was very different from today. At that time the long term facilities it was going into were significantly cheaper than the short term market for 30-day bills, 90-day bills or 180-day bills, which can be locked in. This is one area where the Federal Government could give flexibility to the financial system, which would take significant pressure off the rural sector.

        I turn now to another point in the motionâ€”a competitive tax structure. We have made it quite clear that we will reform in toto the taxation system. That will involve a substantial lowering of income tax rates, it will involve getting rid of the wholesale sales tax, and it will involve the introduction of a goods and services tax. One aspect of a competitive tax structure is the cost of the current wholesale sales tax regime to the trucking industry. The trucking industry is a crucial part of the infrastructure of rural and regional Australia. Under the current tax regime, on a rig worth $250,000 in the first year the owner of that rig, with the various taxes on it, including the wholesale sales tax, will pay some $80,000 in tax for the privilege of owning and operating it. That does not include income tax if the owner happens to make a profit. In the current situation it is very difficult for such an owner to make a profit. Under our proposals, because these items are business input cost items, such an owner will not have to pay that tax as it will be a credit back to him.

        That on its own will make a significant contribution to the cost infrastructure of transport. It will have benefits not only for rural and regional Australia, to which this motion relates, but for all Australians. There is little that we do in our lives which in terms of business costs does not contain some component that is not transported from one place to another during the life of its operation. In Australia there is little or nothing that does not involve some component of transportâ€”a transport component which currently is very heavily taxed.

        The other area where action could be taken to ease the pressure of costs is that of fuel excise. During the regime of this Government we have seen fuel excise move from a figure of slightly more than 6c a litre to a figure of 25c a litre today. I appreciate that diesel fuel used on farm is fully rebated but that is just one component of the fuel cost to the rural sector. The trucking industry carries this load, and only about one third of that tax is returned to the roads. It also has an on-farm impact in terms of petrol. The duty is not rebatable on petrol and many vehicles used on farm are petrol driven, particularly in the stock industries and the depressed wool industry at present.

        What always staggers me is the fact that the rail system pays a fuel excise towards the building of roads. I have highlighted a couple of areas in which significant differences could be brought about to the cost inputs paid by the rural sector and others at present. It is worth noting that the fuel costs of our subsidised, highly assisted competitors in the United States are half the Australian costs. In view of the current availability of fuel in this country, particularly oils used in the production of diesel and petrol, it is not necessary that our fuel prices should be so high.

       That is quite nonsensical and totally misrepresents our industrial relations policy. Reform of the industrial relations system is absolutely essential if we are to lift productivity. I welcomeâ€”as does John Howard but he was once again misrepresented by the Ministerâ€”what the Commission did last week, but it is only one small step in reforming our industrial relations system. Under current law it can go no further. That decision prevents employers and employees making their own arrangements.

        I want to make it quite clearâ€”and this has been spelt out many times and it is not necessary for the Minister to misrepresent the positionâ€”that under our policy people will have the option of staying in the current system or of making their own arrangements. The difference between our position and the Government's is that we will give people freedom of choice to enter into the sort of arrangement that suits them. Employers and employees will be able to negotiate their own workplace voluntary agreements. They will not have to be subject to big brother in the form of the unions, employer organisations and the Commission all looking over their shoulder. As I have said, they will have the option of staying in the current system or of moving out.

Therefore, it is impossible to remove the Commission.

        I would also like to put straight an interjection this afternoon by Senator Cook about New Zealand shearers. We agree that we are here to help primary industries. How better can we help than by getting costs down? Senator Cook said that New Zealand shearers were undercutting Australian shearers. For Senator Cook's informationâ€”I doubt whether he has had much to do with a shearing shed or shearersâ€”New Zealand shearers are not undercutting Australian award rates. They are shearing for Australian award rates, which is taking the pressure off the Australian farmers to pay overaward rates to shearers. That is exactly what they are doing.

        If any undercutting is done, it is the undercutting of overaward payments. We cannot call that undercutting; it is enterprise bargaining, but enterprise bargaining at award rates. That is what the New Zealand shearers are doing. I for one welcome the New Zealand shearers in Australia not only because they have kept the costs in line with award rates but also because, if it were not for them, we would probably not have enough shearers to produce the Australian clip. Obviously, few younger Australian shearers are prepared to come forward.

        The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics forecasts wheat yields for the current crop at 1.24 tonnes a hectare, which is about 25 per cent less than last year and 20 per cent below the average for the past five years. ABARE says that this is the lowest yield since 1982-83. Incidentally, this Government cannot blame Malcolm Fraser for that, as it blamed him for everything that happened in the recession of 1982-83, which was caused by the drought. Total winter cereal productionâ€”wheat, barley, oats and triticaleâ€”in 1991-92 is forecast at 15 million tonnes, 28 per cent less than last year. And so it goes on.

In Western Australia the Moora pulp mill is being set up to use straw that has been left behind in the paddocks. The Western Australian branch of the Printing and Kindred Industries Unionâ€”which has nothing to do with the Moora pulp mill because the mill is not even working yetâ€”has members who currently work for two opposition pulp mills in Western Australia.

        In my motion I also referred to interest rates. I know that interest rates are lower now, but the fact is that the best rate a person can get as a lender to the bank is about 8.3 per cent, as of Monday. The rate has not come down because the banks anticipated it. On the same day the prime rate was 13.5 per cent. That is a mark-up of 63 per cent. If an item in a retail shop were to be marked up by 63 per cent, we would claim that the shop was having a lend of us. That is the prime lending rate. The banks are still charging farmers between 18 per cent and 19 per cent, which is a mark-up of 250 per cent. How are the banks helping the situation?

        My motion states that we lack a competitive international tax structure. Last March the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) brought down a statement that contained some measures that could help the rural industries. One was sales tax on lubricants and hand tools used in agriculture. There was provision for a better depreciation schedule, but where is the legislation? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who was responsible for bringing that statement into the Senate, is on duty in the chamber. I ask him: where is the necessary legislation? The statement was made in Marchâ€”seven months agoâ€”but we have not seen the legislation. The Government got the kudos for the March statement, which it said was the best industry statement ever. Where is the legislation to enable people to get the benefits of it? It has not been forthcoming. The Government makes these promises, they sound good in the press, but nothing comes to fruition.

        The decision of Rocklea to close the National Textiles spinning mill at Kotara, Newcastle, is to be condemned, particularly in view of the fact that it has just been announced that the mill is to receive a capitalisation grant of $15.9m. It is typical of the mismanagement of this Government that a company can buy a cotton spinning mill, receive a grant in respect of that mill for such a large amount of money and then calmly close the mill down, putting 327 people out of a job in a period when unemployment in this country is a cause of enormous concern. Meanwhile, the Government of the day, and particularly the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), sits back and washes its hands of the matter like Pontius Pilate saying, `In truth, the fact is that Kotara is an old, outdated plant and, whatever the Government did, it would have to close at some stage'.

Therefore, the entire purpose of the grant is to give industry an opportunity to restructure, to become more efficient and to contribute to the export potential of this country. Allowing a company to receive a grant and to then shut up the shop does not seem to be a tremendous stimulus for the restructuring process. The resulting action by Rocklea has in fact only served to harm the very people that it is supposed to be helping.

        The Federal Labor Government has taken the people of the Hunter for granted by allowing a long established company and employer in the region to close down. The most remarkable aspect of this tragedy, however, is that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce had the means available to prevent this from occurring but neglected to do so, preferring instead to place ever more hardship on the people of the Hunter and increasing the already high number of unemployed people in this country. Upon approval of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the capitalisation grant provided the opportunity for eligible textile yarn producers to receive a one-off, up-front grant in lieu of continued bounty receipts. A company's application for the grant must be supported by a business plan.

This business plan, therefore, is very detailed. It provides the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authorityâ€”and, through it, the Ministerâ€”with all necessary future projections and anticipated actions of the applicant. The TCF Development Authority, after considering the plan, recommends to the Minister whether to allow the grant. The key criteria by which these applications are assessed are whether the business plan will contribute to the restructuring and revitalisation of the textile, footwear and clothing industry and whether the grant will result in fewer budgetary outlays from the Commonwealth than would otherwise have been provided by ongoing bounty assistance.

         In looking at the details of the treatment of the manufacturing sector and the Government's lackadaisical approach in the monitoring of the most efficient and appropriate application of the $15.9m of taxpayers' money, it is obvious that there are only two possible conclusions to be reached regarding the decision to proceed with this grant. This is particularly so in the light of changes that must obviously have been made to the business plan and the capitalisation agreement. The first is that the Minister was fully aware of the plans of the new owner of the mill and therefore decided to put 327 people out of work, thereby pushing the role of women in the work force further into the background and adding to the woes of the people in the Newcastle region, so frequently neglected by this Labor Government. The alternative must be that the Minister is completely negligent in his responsibilities, as set out in the legislation introduced by the Government.

Why create a situation which leads to the shutdown of a factory in the Hunter Valley that employs 327 people, adding to the dole queue, thus continuing to rip large chunks out of the economy and the region? Why not upgrade the technology of the production process, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the plant and therefore improving its export potential for this country?

If that is the case, it is appalling that this Government is taking such an indifferent attitude to the application of such an enormous amount of money that is supposed to be contributing to the revitalisation and reconstruction of the textile industry in this country. What is perhaps even more astounding is that the Minister, as reported in the press, has the gall to say that Rocklea should have consulted the workers before closing down the plant and that any future grants will depend on consultation with the unions.

Instead, an assurance has to be given by the Minister that he will do all in his power to ensure that this disgraceful misallocation of funds can never recur so that people in these industries are not further disadvantaged and so that the textile industry in this country is able to become more efficient without the blatant disregard of the people working in the industry that this Labor Government has shown.

We must have in mind, of course, that they only continue until 1995. The decision to give this grant was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority.

It is a disastrous event for people to lose their jobs anywhere during such severe economic times and our thoughts must go out to those families whose breadwinners may well end up on the dole queues next year. However, the loss of some 327 jobs from the Newcastle area is particularly alarming as the region has already suffered badly.

         The Australian Democrats call for a complete overhaul of the guidelines for administration of the bounty system. Taxpayers' money must have strings and accountability attaching to its use. The Government must bear the responsibility in this instance and ensure that in future it has more information as to how the funds will be used. The textile, clothing and footwear plan still has four years to run and we must prevent this situation happening again.

         Senator Foreman claimed that I made a number of errors. I would not disagree at all with a number of the claims that he made. He talked about the need for the company to be internationally competitive, he talked about capitalisation being cheaper than giving out bounties and he talked about safeguards. I do not have a great deal of disagreement with those sorts of issues at all.

         But let us return to the central issues of the Rocklea case. Senator Foreman has obviously not read the Newcastle newspapers or paid attention to other media outlets which have reported the comments of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the local members of parliament about what has happened. They were appalled.

         At a number of points in his speech, Senator Foreman seemed to claim that there was some sort of consultation. I will point out some errors in what the honourable senator has said. When did that consultation happen? There was no lead-up to this. Newcastle was not aware that this plant was going to close. It took the local members of parliament by surprise and it certainly took the unions by surprise. It suddenly appeared out of the blue in the city newspaper reports.

         The plant happens to be located about 1,000 yards from where I live and local people were totally unaware that suddenly 300-odd jobs were going to disappear. I can assure the honourable senator that, when one tries to take jobs away from Newcastle, one knows about it in the media; just as the Government has known in the past in relation to the frigate contract, the submarine contract and even in relation to the AMSAâ€”the sea safety centreâ€”which it promised to give to Newcastle but, at the last minute, took away.

         When governments do this sort of thing to Newcastle, it gets up in arms. The issue ran through the media day after day for weeks on endâ€”yet previously we had heard nothing; it was a total surprise. The matter was described as some of the most appalling handling ever of an industrial situation in this country. Even honourable senators on Senator Foreman's side have said they could not believe that this sort of thing would continue to happen in this century.

         This company, without consultation, has acted like a corporate raider. It has taken over a company purely for the purpose of grabbing hold of this capitalisation grant. It then plans to transfer resources to Victoria away from Newcastle yet again and in the process shut down jobs in an area that is already massively depressed in terms of employment. The great tragedy in an industrial city where women find it very hard to get jobs is that 327 jobs that are mainly for women have disappeared. This Government, in the middle of a recession, should really hang its head in shame because through its lack of supervision it has created a situation where not only people including women have lost jobs but also this vital region has lost jobs.

         If we look back to the whole way that this capitalisation grant scheme is set up, we can see that this should not have happened. We have a situation where a firm has to put forward a business plan. I detailed in my speech what was needed in that business plan. How can a government that is properly supervising what is going on allow a grant to be given out to a company that obviously has not submitted a proper business plan? If it did, the Government has not scrutinised what the company was doing. I certainly hope that this Government can stop the payment of the money to this group of corporate raiders and ensure in future that, when it is giving out capitalisation money, the money is spent in the way in which the Government intended.

         The Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991â€”the Actâ€”establishes a code of conduct when Commonwealth offences are being investigated by State, Territory or Federal police.

         At present, the Act applies when a Commonwealth offence created by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament is being investigated and when an `applied' Commonwealth offence is being investigated. An `applied' Commonwealth offence is created when an offence that would normally be a State offence, such as armed robbery or assault, occurs on a Commonwealth place. To overcome an unintended consequence of the Constitution which did not allow State law to apply in those situations the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 which deems such offences to be Commonwealth offences. State police can then investigate and prosecute these `applied' Commonwealth offences, and they are treated as if they were State offences.

Now the substantive provisions of Part 1C are proclaimed, State police, when investigating these `applied' Commonwealth offences are bound by the provisions of Part 1C. In particular, they will be required to electronically record all police interviews with suspects because failure to do so renders any evidence obtained during such interviews prima facie inadmissible.

The `applied' provisions are essentially State offences that have been artificially federalised for constitutional reasons. They are part of the States' criminal calendar, not the Commonwealth's and they are normally prosecuted by State, as opposed to Commonwealth, Directors of Prosecution. Sentenced accused are State prisoners, and any fines realised go to State revenue. Part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 in its initial stages will cause some operational difficulties to the States and Territories.

         However, the Family Law Council has recommended that the Family Law Act should allow the Family Court to determine custody, guardianship, maintenance and access disputes where this would not interfere with the protection of the child by child welfare authorities. Following discussions with State and Territory Governments, it has been agreed that the Family Law Act and State referral of powers legislation should be amended to give the Family Court power to make custody, guardianship or access orders in respect of children subject to State or Territory child welfare laws provided the written consent of the relevant child welfare officer is obtained to the institution or continuation of the proceedings. The Family Court is also to have power to make maintenance orders in respect of children subject to child welfare legislation. The Bill makes the necessary amendments to the Family Law Act.

         Section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 is to be amended to overcome certain problems arising from the operation of that section in the light of the High Court's decision in The Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Limited (1986) 161 CLR 254. The present terms of section 64 are that, in any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of the parties shall as nearly as possible be the same and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject. As a result of the High Court's decision in the Evans Deakin case, the Commonwealth may, in civil proceedings, in effect become bound by State or Territory legislation by which the enacting State or Territory itself is not bound. This may mean, for example, that the Commonwealth could become liable for damages for breaching a duty imposed by a State law that does not in its terms purport to apply either to the Commonwealth or to the enacting State. This goes beyond what appears to have been the original intention behind section 64.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, section 64 will not in effect make the Commonwealth subject to State or Territory legislation that does not bind the enacting State or Territory of its own force. This will remove the main anomaly exposed by the Evans Deakin caseâ€”that is, that the Commonwealth may in effect be bound by State or Territory legislation which the enacting State or Territory legislature has decided is not suitable to bind the State or Territory itself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, section 64 will not make the Commonwealth liable for damages in an action for a breach of statutory duty under a prescribed law of a State or Territory. This will enable the Commonwealth, by prescribing a State or Territory law by regulation, to prevent itself from being sued for damages for breaching a duty under the law irrespective of whether the law binds the enacting State or Territory. A regulation prescribing a State or Territory law will only operate prospectively and will not remove any accrued rights against the Commonwealth. This mechanism is necessary to prevent the Commonwealth from becoming liable to possibly very large damages on the basis of new State or Territory laws which have been enacted primarily from a State viewpoint and without adequate regard to the Commonwealth's special needs or problems. A regulation will, of course, be subject to disallowance.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, in a suit to which a State is a party, section 64 will not give to another party, as against the State, any right that the party would not otherwise have. This amendment is being made at the request of the States. Section 64 in its present form purports to alter the statutory law applicable to the States in civil proceedings in federal jurisdiction. The Commonwealth agrees with the States that this is inappropriate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.

         â€”I would like to question the Minister further with regard to the changes in the charging structure of the Civil Aviation Authority and particularly his answers to questions that I asked. During the Estimates Committee hearings reference was made to the costs being offset in terms of the increased charges by the fact that the excise had been removed off avtur fuel which is used in certain aircraft. At that time I also referred to those aircraft that use avgas. My understanding is that the excise has not been taken off those aircraft that were using avgas and that they are subject to significant increases in charges. In fact, their charges have gone up significantly.

         Returning to aircraft using avtur gas, I asked a question of the Minister in Estimates to which I have been given an answer. I do not find the answer satisfactory in terms of the information it gives. I asked:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Is it correct that charges on 5,000 kg aircraft flying 1000 hours per annum had risen from $8,300 in 1988 to around $120,000 by 1990?
       </para>
       <para>
        In the answer that has been given to me a case has been made which suggests that the costs are very much the same but that in real terms, because we are living with dollars that are approximately four years down the track, there has been a significant decrease. I would suggest that the figures used in this answer to calculate the position as against the position today are not accurate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         When one works through the figures that have been given to us and compares them with actual information that has been given to me by air operators one sees that, in fact, the real cost of the operation today should be in the order of $110,000 to $120,000 per aircraft. I suggest that the figures presented here of $85,000 to $94,000 are an underestimate of the actual figures.

         I have discussed this matter with a number of aircraft operatorsâ€”particularly those operating in rural Australia because it impacts on the aircraft that are generally used there, not the larger onesâ€”and the suggestion is that 1,000 flights each covering about 450 kilometres or 500 flights each covering about 900 kilometres is not a representative position. It appears that in terms of 1,000 hours of flying, the maximum that can be got out of these legs is about 400 trips, and that substantially changes the figures. If required I can table this example of the costs that arise.

         I would like to move to the end of the question which states that if it is related to the position four years ago, the figures would range from $85,000 to $95,000. I believe there is a fundamental flaw in those estimations. When one works through the figures, a figure of 21.25c for excise has been used. In actual fact, at the time, the excise was of the order of 16c and there needs to be a recalculation. In fact, the position which arises is that the costs for the operations of these aircraft in this arena are significantly higher today than they were when the changes were made.

         As Senator Crane would be aware, at the moment we are undertaking what is a difficult and very comprehensive complete restructuring of the Civil Aviation Authority. As I have said on previous occasions, most of the press and public attention is, probably not unreasonably, centred on the waterfront side of my portfolio. In fact, the changes that we are bringing about in the aviation area are just as unprecedented and as far reaching and, without question in my mind, as economically important for Australia as anything that is being done on the waterfront. I am sure that Senator Crane will be aware that there is a very substantial restructuring of the Civil Aviation Authority which is currently resulting in a very large number of its staff leaving and, of course, the installation of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new technology over the next four or five years.

It asserts, as Senator Crane has indicated, that currently the level of charges that is being imposed on avtur aircraft is no greater than was previously imposed with the exciseâ€”the levy on the fuel.

My understandingâ€”and I would like this clarifiedâ€”is that if an operator is having difficulties he can have his aircraft confiscated. What is the procedure in this situation? What leeway is given to people to allow them to catch up? This is particularly relevant to the case I have referred to, where an operator bought an aircraft which had some back payment debt on it. The debt to the Civil Aviation Authority went with the aircraft; it did not stay with the previous owner. The operator was unable to pick up the debt in time and he is now under threat of having that aircraft confiscated. In fact the debt really belongs to the previous operator. What is the policy position in that situation?

         â€”No, we are talking about CAA charges, not the FAC. It could well be that the seller of the aircraft had an arrangement with the buyer that the aircraft would be discounted by the purchaser being prepared to take responsibility for paying that debt. In another transaction in which I am involved fairly regularlyâ€”in the transfer of small businesses that have liquor licences, for example, where that is a real commercial asset and the original seller or the owner of the property may owe money to the liquor commissionâ€”it is not uncommon to have that taken into account. When the licence is renewed, the new owner then becomes obliged to pay that debt. I assume that that is the case.

         To answer the first part of Senator Crane's question, the Civil Aviation Authority certainly has the power to place liens over aircraft. They only ever do so as a last resort.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I can assure Senator Crane, from my experience with a number of matters involving small operators particularly that have come up while I have been Minister, that the CAA does go to considerable lengths to assist companies, provided it is within the overall context that these debts are owed to the CAA and have to be paid. In my experience, the CAA certainly goes to extreme lengths to assist people in the industry in organising payments. It is only as an absolute last resort that a lien would be placed over an aircraft.

         Further to my letter of 5 September 1991, I advise that the Civil Aviation Authority have taken their draconian powers another step further. I am advised that all of my aircraft are to be deregistered this month. I am at a loss to decide what to do, because it is not simply a matter of just going broke, as they have the liens over the aircraft for previous charges, which in some cases have absolutely nothing to do with me.

        That is referring to the actual transfer. Clearly, when such a cost is included in the commercial transaction, I imagine that an operator with any business nous at all would offer a discount on the price to offset that, if it was being transferred. I would like to pursue this matter privately with the Minister to see whether we can sort it out. It seems to be an unusual practice and, on the surface, unsatisfactory.

         â€”I am happy to accommodate Senator Crane privately in that respect. I make a general point to Senator Crane, although I am not suggesting for a minute that it applies to this particular case. First of all, I am obviously reluctant to speak in more specific terms because quite often in matters of this kind, as in the normal commercial world, legal action is afoot. As I discovered just recently in a matter that another senator was pursuing in relation to another organisation, not the CAA, in a series of questions that were askedâ€”and I am not suggesting that this is the case with the matters raised by Senator Craneâ€”the senator did not alert me to the fact that legal action was proceeding for recovery of the money and that the case was actually in court at the time the matter was being pursued. I subsequently discovered that. I think it is always wise, particularly having regard to the rights of the parties concerned, not to prejudice any legal action that might be afoot in canvassing these issues publicly.

         There is a second general point I want to make, and again I am not suggesting that this applies to this specific case. It is often the case that, when aviation companies are in some financial difficulty, they deal on the basis of leaving the Governmentâ€”that is, the CAA or the FAC or whoeverâ€”until last in trying to keep creditors from the door. As I have said many times before, it is an extremely difficult industry in which to operate successfully. I have said before that I would not personally be involved in it as an operator. One has to love flying. I regularly use some of the most efficient and professional operators, and I know that the overheads, the intense competition and so on in the industry mean that one has to be a good businessman to survive.

         The difficulty for organisations such as the FAC and the CAAâ€”and the bottom line eventually does have to be reachedâ€”is that they are expected to treat all operators in the aviation industry in the same way. I can assure the honourable senator, from personal representations I have occasionally received, that other operators in the industry who may be in direct competition with the company involved are not particularly happy to find out that arrangements, at least allegedly, are being made to provide something that may not be extended to them.

         â€”Yes, it is difficult. I did have a conversation with Senator Tambling briefly before I had to leave. I have just had to attend two meetings and I have literally not had a minute off since I left the chamber. I have just been to the Labour Advisory Council meeting and I have come from there: the meeting is still going on. The difficulty isâ€”and Senator Tambling has agreed with thisâ€”that his request for a list of the concessionaires at the airports and for details of the progress, dates and conditions of the leases involves some commercial confidentiality. If those matters are made public, people might draw quite erroneous conclusions from the fact that some companies have executed leases and some have not. They may draw the wrong conclusions which may affect companies in terms of dealing with clients, particularly if they happen to owe money. Senator Tambling has conceded this point.

         I apologise for this, but the difficulty is that I am literally the only person in my office who knows which bits to tear off and which bits to leave in the book, and I have just not had time. I wonder whether I could ask the attendant to take these papers to Senator Tambling. I have just torn out for him the lists of the concessionaires at both Darwin and Alice Springs airports. I have given an undertaking to Senator Tambling, which I will discharge, to give him, on a confidential basis, the rest of the page containing the remainder of the information he soughtâ€”that is, the dates that the leases have been executed and the actual state of each lease.

         On the question of the cost to the FAC budget for interest or other costs to compensate concessionaires for the delays in opening Darwin and Alice Springs terminals, it is actually impossible at this stage to quantify that because the Federal Airports Corporation has conceded, in the Estimates Committee itself, that there may well be some compensation that has to be paid. I confirm that the Corporation is currently considering applications that have been made by two of the concessionaires as to claims for payments, but those negotiations are still under way. So the answer to Senator Tambling's question is that it is impossible to give a global figure at this stage because the matters are still under consideration. However, I can certainly give Senator Tambling an undertaking that, now that the dates of the opening of the two buildings have been set, the global figureâ€”it will not be broken up into individual concernsâ€”that is provided by the FAC in any negotiations that are concluded, will be provided to him publicly.

         Without going into gory details, but to put it nicely in context for me, I must point out that recently I opened the airport terminal in Mackay, which is privately owned by the Mackay Port Authority. In Mackay I was interested to learn, quite independently of anything that had happened in the Northern Territory, that the negotiations between the Mackay Port Authority and the airlines over the leases to the buildings there were just as protracted and just as difficult as those over the leases for the Alice Springs and Darwin airport terminals. Perhaps Senator Tambling could jog my memory on the third matter raised.

         â€”I thank the honourable senator. There is in fact a schedule containing those amounts. Again, those figures are broken up into individual companies and, on the same basis and for the same reasons I have already given, I would much prefer to provide all that information to Senator Tambling on a confidential basis, which I will do. The general run of figures in an overall sense is that the valuations on the north side of the airport, which have been recommended by the Australian Valuation Office, range between $7 a square metre and $15 a square metre, depending on whether they are for heavy, medium or light use. Those figures cannot be relied upon because it is a matter of public record that the FAC, understanding the difficulties that some of the light aviation people are having, has made very significant offers of discounting and phasing in arrangements. I have no hesitation in saying again that until those negotiations have been completed with the companies concerned, first, it is simply not possible to give Senator Tambling an actual figure, because in some cases the figures have not yet been arrived at; and, secondly, in the case of the individual companies concerned, they would be commercially confidential.

         However, those are the general terms of the north side leases which have been negotiated in that sort of range, and additional incentives are being provided to assist the operators in their move to the north side. That would compare with existing rental rates in what are, without question, compared with what is being offered now, very substandard facilities indeed. On the south side of the airport the figures are between $4 and $5 a square metre up to some higher figures, depending on what is provided by the FAC as part of those lease arrangements. Those are the broad figures and I have no difficulty in providing Senator Tambling with a breakdown of the detailed figures, company by company, on a commercially confidential basis.

         In general terms, there has been a lot of publicity about this matter generated in the Northern Territory, a great deal of which has been inaccurate. I can fully understand the wishes of any company that is paying $X for anything not wanting to pay $X plus whatever it is. I can understand that. But as I have explained and demonstrated in the past, in the case of some operators who have claimed massive percentage increases for lease payments in moving from the south side to the north side of the airport, those percentage figures are totally misleading. Those operators have moved out of what are, in some cases, very grotty and cramped surroundings, and have asked not only for prime lots but also for areas of land that are five, six or 10 times in excess of the areas for which they are currently paying.

         The second issue relates to the costs to the FAC budgets. The Minister has said that at the moment they are impossible to assess, but he will make publicly available the global figure when it is known, which I presume will be acknowledged when the dates of opening are finalised. The Minister has previously indicated that the opening date for Alice Springs will be 8 December and that for Darwin will be 14 December. I think it is important that that be acknowledged. There has been considerable speculation about the costs attributable to the various delays that have been caused by many factors in this whole area. It will be important for the public record that the additional costs are known so that people, including me, do not compound the figure unnecessarily. I appreciate that.

         On the third issue, the Minister has outlined the ballpark figures relating to the lease charges that will be implemented for the movement of general aviation operators from the existing Darwin Airport site to the new north side facilities. I acknowledge that the facilities being provided are of a far superior standard to those that currently exist on the south side. It does concern me that on the figures that the Minister indicated, even after allowing for the various discounts and incentives that will be available, we will still be seeing the necessity, on a square metre basis, for lease costs to increase from between 50 per cent to 300 per cent.

         I surely acknowledge that, if an operator chooses to take larger space than that from which he currently operates on the existing site, of course the operator will be up for the additional space allocation at whatever cost has to be negotiated. That is a reality of growth and changing to new facilities. But I think it will be of concern to many travellers, operators and business people in the Northern Territory that the operators, even if they took the same space requirement, would be up for additional lease rents, as I said, from 50 per cent to 300 per cent. That, of course, will be added to by the additional space that they take for their improved operations.

         I am still concerned that, during the Estimates Committee hearings, the Minister, and I think some of the officers, indicated that there were problems in facilitating the move across of a number of the general aviation operators before March 1992, when the technical head leases with the Department of Defence expire on the existing sites. It will be very unfortunate if the operation of general aviation in the Northern Territory, Darwin in particular, has to be split between two locations over an extensive period of time, particularly if the operators are not able to negotiate special arrangements in the interim period with the Department of Defence.

This is important to the servicing of a large number of Aboriginal communities that use the general aviation facilities and also to a large number of tourists in the Northern Territory who access the general aviation tourist operations that currently operate.

I acknowledge that it will be great when the travelling public will be able to use those facilities. I sincerely hope that we will not see an ongoing saga in the general aviation area that extends over an equally long period of time such as that which had to apply to the more commercial operations. In that regard, I acknowledge the information that the Minister has made available both here and on a confidential basis. There is one other issue, of course, which I presume the Minister is holding back in order to give me separate information on it.

It has soured otherwise good relations between us quite a bit. The FAC, I can assure Senator Tambling, has been consistent in wanting to accelerate this move of general aviation over to the north side of the airport. The one fly in the ointment consistently has been me and I freely confess it. Therefore, I am pleased to hear those words from Senator Tambling.

         The reason that I make these points is that I received today what I consider to be a quite extraordinary letter on this issue from the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works, Mr Finch. If I had it with me in the chamber, I would table it. Mr Finch indicated that he would be at the opening of the two terminals, whether he was invited or not. Perhaps in response to that, I could just say that I was astonished at the letter because of what I have said in the past. He made reference in the letter to my statement in parliament that I hoped he would not have the hide to turn up at the opening of these terminals, considering the five-year campaign waged against the FAC and these terminals. I want to make it clear that I have no role to play in the invitations that are being issued by the FAC. It is its terminal; it is its opening.

         I have been invited to participate in the opening and have been delighted to accept. The invitations will be issued by the FAC and not by me, so I will have to refer Mr Finch's letter to the Corporation. It will be delightful to see him at the opening of the Darwin Airport terminal, in view of the fact that to this point he has never stuck his nose inside the building. I have always thought that was extraordinary considering, first, that he lives five minutes by road away from the front entrance of the building, and, secondly, that he came as far as the Northern Territory's road improvements. He was being watched by FAC employees at the airport who were taking bets on whether he would step across to the FAC side of the road to come up to look at the terminal.

         I make no bones about saying that I think that it is one of the most small-minded performances from a politician that I have seen. Senator Tamblingâ€”and I have publicly acknowledged the efforts he has made over these airport terminals in the pastâ€”has gladly accepted the invitations that he has received and has visited both projects. I know that he was impressed with the buildings both at Alice Springs and Darwin. But the responsible Minister in the Northern Territory, Mr Finch, has railed against these projects for five years and deliberately has never set foot inside these buildings at any stage of their construction, despite the fact that he is the Northern Territory Minister most closely associated with these desperately needed airport facilities. I will not be inviting him because it is not my role to invite anybody, but I will be delighted to see Mr Finch at the opening of the Darwin Airport terminal because it will be the first time that he has set foot in this facility since construction work started.

         The reason I make that point is that it has been a long hard slog to get these terminals established. We know what it cost the Labor Party politically. We had a rerun, by courtesy of the CLP, of the television pictures of the Prime Minister driving a bulldozer and turning the first sod in every election campaign thereafter.

         â€”Yes, and he did it well too. The facts areâ€”and I have said this publicly before and do not mind saying it againâ€”that the Alice Springs terminal is certainly a commercial terminal. The reason for that is that currently it does not require a very expensive international facility to be provided for what in Darwin are a relatively small number of international flights. Alice Springs has twice the passengers that Darwin Airport has because few are originating passengers. Alice Springs has become an extremely important aviation hub in Australia, I am delighted to say. It connects the west coast with the east coast and, indeed, the north coast with the south coast. It has become an attractive holiday package for people to transit through Alice Springs and to see the entire country by virtue of air travel in a matter of a week. Because of that the revenue from the terminal is good due to the extensive use of the terminal, but the facilities that have to be provided are not so great as they are in Darwin because they are mostly transit passengers through Alice Springs rather than originating passengers.

         It was a very difficult battle indeed to get the FAC to accept Darwin on its list. In the end the Federal Government only did so through a lot of blood, sweat and tears.

The arched roof entrance of the foyer, with a veranda style opening to the terminal, will make Darwin one of the more attractive terminalsâ€”I do not want to be too Top End parochialâ€”in Australia.

         There was an even more disgraceful performanceâ€”I can now fully tell the story for the first time; I could not tell it at the timeâ€”when in the middle of the project the firm of John Holland was desperately trying to finish as much of the exterior work as possible before the wet season, before the rain started, so that they could complete the internal work in the building, stories were peddled by Mr Finch and his office. I was told this personally by two Darwin journalists who had been the recipients of these stories. It was said that John Holland was about to go broke and this caused all the supplies to the airport terminals to be frozen for 24 hours by the suppliers. The opinion in John Holland at that time as to what went on was not fit to print. John Holland had done an extraordinary job on this airport terminal which was on budget, ahead of time and resulted in a beautifully finished building. This was at a time when the firm was racing the clouds and the wet season to get the work finished.

On that occasion I even had to ring the Chief Minister's office to protest about it. I thought it was a disgraceful action for a Northern Territory Minister to take.

         I hope that all those shenanigans and closing of roads will stop and that the Northern Territory Government will get behind the Commonwealth Government to make the opening of these terminals the same extraordinary success as the port authority in Mackay succeeded in doing, as Senator Macdonald will testify, when pretty close to 30,000 people turned out for the opening. It was a tremendous promotional exercise for the district. I hope that everybody cooperates in making sure that the opening of the terminals at Darwin and Alice Springs will be equally successful as a promotion for the Northern Territory.

         The question of Dr Battersby's remuneration has been declared to be commercially confidential. I can only reiterate that I support that position. I indicated before the adjournment that if Dr Battersby herself had no difficulty in having the matter disclosed I would have no difficulty. I said that for a very important reason. Dr Battersby operates in a highly competitive market of consultants who provide art advice to a whole range of organisations in Australia. It is a very competitive market indeed. It would be utterly detrimental to that individual in terms of her own business to have the rates that she has negotiated with the FAC made public. Her competitors would be delighted at that information being revealed. Despite Senator Tambling's assertion, I must assure him, as I thought would be obvious, that in a very competitive private industry the sorts of rates that are negotiated with clients can be of enormous value to one's competitors. That is the situation.

The answer given to the Committee contained a statement by the Federal Airports Corporation that Dr Battersby's remuneration details were negotiated by her with the Corporation on the basis of similar contractual conditions currently applying in the art industry. Whilst the Minister has said that the rate is standard and in the middle range of other consultancies and, therefore, ought not invite any invidious comparison, he has not indicated whether Dr Battersby is in any way engaged on a percentage fee basis, whether a fixed salary or consultancy fee has been negotiated and how that applies with regard to the extent of the work.

         I do not share the Minister's concern about preserving confidentiality in this area. The Commonwealth Government negotiates with people in many other areas.

I am not aware of any other statutory organisation or government department which keeps to itself the basis on which it engages consultants of this nature.

I am happy to indicate to Senator Tambling the broad arrangements, without stating the figures. Dr Battersby, who is eminently qualified to do this job with her experience in the art world and her role for years on the Australia Council, has an arrangement with the FAC where she is paid a flat salaryâ€”it is a relatively modest amount, might I sayâ€”for which she is required to provide general consultancy to the FAC on art matters generally; that is, totally outside of selecting or providing the art works.

         Dr Battersby is on a percentage of the art works acquired, which is also a standard arrangement in that industry with that kind of consultancy.

That is the fundamental basis of the arrangement with Dr Battersby. It is a fairly normal arrangement.

         I just want to finish on a point raised by Senator Tambling before the suspension of the sitting for the dinner. I do not think he has thought it through sufficiently. He complained that more local artists should have their work included in terminals. I was actually lobbied by people in the local art community in Darwin who said that the art works should be provided exclusively by Northern Territory artists. That would be a very detrimental policy for the FAC to adopt. Indeed, I might say that it would be detrimental to Territory artists. It would be an absolute nonsense to suggest that only local artists could provide art works for the buildings in their regions. This would immediately deny the access that I know Territory artists have had to FAC terminals in other parts of Australia.

         One of the points I raised and pursued related to the sale of housing owned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I sought additional information with regard to a number of properties that had been sold. I asked for details of the values at which they had been sold, the dates on which they were sold, and how the calculations had been adopted. I received quite a comprehensive list of properties that have obviously been sold recently by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What concerned me most was that the Corporation had sold a number of these houses with valuation dates quite some considerable time before the date of sale. This is an issue I have raised in other estimates, across a number of other statutory authorities of the Government and several Government departments, including the Department of Administrative Services. What came out of the various inquiries I made of the ABC, the other departments and the agencies of government is that there is no consistent policy relating to the manner in which government housing is sold.

         Whilst there are some general principles that have been struck largely between the Federal Government and the Northern Territory Trades and Labour Council, a number of the statutory authorities in particular have chosen to implement the sales schemes in different manners, particularly with regard to the date of valuation of a property. This concerns me. When we look at the various deals that have been struck under these arrangements with the Trades and Labour Council, we see that the great majority of properties have had valuations predated six months, 12 months or up to 18 months prior to the sale of the property.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In some cases, this has resulted in substantial differences between the contract value, or the sale price, and what ought to have been the current market value of the property at the date of sale. An example instanced recently affected the ABC in the Northern Territory where a property was sold for a figure in the vicinity of $90,000 but the valuation was just above $100,000. Because of several discounts and credits that were available under the schemes that had been negotiated, the sale priceâ€”given that it was a predated valuationâ€”was about $90,000. From memory, the sale was consummated in April or May. Two months later, the staff member who purchased the property sold it on the open commercial market for $155,000â€”a 50 per cent capital gain. Of course, that issue received considerable media attention at that time.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I have been concerned that, because of the administrative delays that have been cemented into the contracts by various departments or agencies such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, there have been considerable losses to the taxpayer. The purchaser has gained a particular advantage. In most of the schemes that have been put in place, they have the right to sell freely on the open market without constraint. I acknowledge that some departments have sales constraints on them. But when I analysed all the answers I received from the various statutory authorities and departments, those with constraints were in the minority; by far the great majority did not have constraints. In fact, the Department of Administrative Services has some 100 properties being offered for sale to tenants that are currently based on these retrospective valuations. The loss is quite considerable.

         I believe that the principles in this sort of market sale situation have in effect been seriously eroded, and to a very large extent these special deals that have been struck between the Federal Government and the unions are unhealthy. I appreciate that I cannot in any way step in and alter any of these contractual situations that have been negotiated. However, I call on the Federal Government to review this valuation process. No State or Territory government would be allowed to adopt this sort of process under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for the sale of their Housing Commission stocks, which must be sold at current market value on the date of application by the tenant. This creates a tremendous anomaly in the sale of public housing that is available. On the one hand, we have tenants of Housing Commission homes who have to pay full market value for the houses they purchase under the agreements and the arrangements; on the other hand, public servants or employees of statutory authorities such as the ABC are given a special privileged situation.

         The other issue I raised with Senator Bolkus in one of the Estimates committees was that I do not believe that statutory authorities such as the ABC, or even Government departments, have yet fully acknowledged that they are probably going to have to foot the bill for fringe benefits tax. They have allowed valuations for housing sales to be retrospective and there has been a period in between.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         When the Government or its agencies or its statutory authorities strike special deals with their employees and their unions, they should front up to their financial responsibilities under the fringe benefits tax, just as any private sector employer would have to do if it sold housing to its employees.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I instance people who work for mining companies or people in remote communities who negotiate housing arrangements. There would be no way in the world that the Australian Taxation Office would not pursue with a vengeance any private similar stunt.

         I believe it is incumbent on the Australian Broadcasting Commission to acknowledge and to recognise this. Has it discussed this matter with the Australian Taxation Office and has it had to pay any fringe benefits tax? Certainly, we need to be assured that, in any future sales of this nature that are negotiated around Australia, the Commonwealth does not avoid its proper responsibilities to the taxpayer, to the tenants of Housing Commission homes, and to the very employees it is seeking to serve.

         â€”During Estimates hearings I asked Mr Hill a question on editorial control in Radio Australia. I asked whether, in terms of the broadcasts going out through Radio Australia, skilled journalists had the final responsibility for what went out. In reply to my question Mr Hill said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The newsroom decides on the stories and then the broadcast officer with the language skills translates and it is broadcast. That system is unchanged, except that there has been a very long demarcation dispute that we are trying to overcome, which means that you have two different unions handling copy. We are optimistic that at last we are going to break through there, but apart from reducing the demarcation system whereby the newsroom decides editorially the news copy and the translator translates, that system will stay.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that that answer was strictly correct. In fact, there has been a substantial change in the position adopted previously by Radio Australia. I believe that editorial discipline and editorial control and responsibility are of extreme national importance, by virtue of the fact that Radio Australia broadcasts into the north Asia region, the south Asia region and the Pacific. There are international ramifications for Australia if the stories are not controlled, the disciplines are not there or we get the stories wrong.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I do not believe that Mr Hill's answer was strictly correct because on 12 August 1991 there was a significant change to the procedure adopted by Radio Australia. Prior to 12 August a chief subeditor and a duty editor had the final responsibility for determining the final stories and the order in which they went out through Radio Australia. This matter was raised with me by a couple of journalists from Radio Australia and I have checked it with a couple of others independently. A letter to me reads:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You may be interested to know that under a system introduced to Radio Australia on August 12, 1991, the 50-year-old practice of experienced journalists deciding which stories are used by the foreign language services ceased. Since that date, the only control which Radio Australia journalists retain in determining the composition of foreign language news broadcasts is through the designation of certain stories as "must runs" i.e., that they must be used. However, we have been instructed to keep the number of `must run' stories to a bare minimum. The foreign language services are at liberty to select whatever other stories written by the journalists that they may wish to use from a common "pool" of stories. This amounts to a fundamental change in the operation of the newsroom and has resulted in considerable anguish among journalists about the appropriateness of some of the stories which have been selected for use in foreign language news broadcasts. It is a matter of great concern to the newsroom journalists at Radio Australia that foreign language broadcasts are now under the total control of persons who in many cases are not Australian citizens and who may not have Australia's interests at heart.
       </para>

       <para>
        In addition to that, which is a journalist's interpretation, I also have a direction on information program coordinators which went out under the name of the General Manager of Radio Australia, Mr Broinowski. That spells out quite clearly that in future broadcast offices in each of the three regional services would carry out information program coordination in isolation from journalists.

         I believe that the changes that have been made there are a lot more significant than Mr Hill led us to believe in the answer he gave to us in Estimates hearings. These changes concern me. I do not believe that, in the situation that exists now, there is a chief editor totally responsible for the selection of stories that go out through Radio Australia, as is indicated by the information I have presented. On top of that, I am also informed that, even with the changes that have been made, about 10 per cent of the `must run' stories have not been used under the current modus operandi. I regard that as being equally serious.

         However, that is not my main concern. My main concern is that Radio Australia is now operating without a chief editor in control of the editorial content of the stories that are broadcast. I ask the Minister to examine this issue. It is very serious and should be addressed, because it goes beyond the shores of Australia. It goes to our near neighbours, particularly countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, to name just two, and from time to time relations between Australia and those countries are at best rather tenuous.

         â€”I preface my answer to Senator Crane by commending and supporting Radio Australia on this particular change. It is an extremely sensible change which is designed to improve the attractiveness of what, I am pleased to say, is already an internationally renowned and very popular service in the areas to which it is broadcast. I understand perfectly the correspondence that the journalists in the newsroom have sent to Senator Crane. Indeed, I have seen a copy of it myself and I fully understand the reasons why they have done so. But I am sure that Senator Crane would appreciate the very sensible reasons why Radio Australia has chosen to change the arrangements in the way it has.

         The most obvious comparison I can draw with this arrangement which may be familiar to Senator Craneâ€”it is certainly familiar to a number of people in this buildingâ€”is the AAP news scan service which we are able to access on the computers in our offices. As Senator Crane would be aware, AAP provides two levels of stories in that news service: high and low. The arrangements at Radio Australia are a lot tighter than this, but that is a reasonable comparison.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The stories are sent out on the wire to the hundreds of newspapers that take that copy. The reason it is done that wayâ€”apart from having a pool of journalists accessing the storiesâ€”is that the high priority stories are clearly flagged with `high' to draw the attention of editors, subeditors, chiefs of staff and so on to the particularly newsworthy stories. But the actual choice as to what stories from that pool appearâ€”particularly stories from the secondary pool of low priority storiesâ€”is made by local journalists in the regions they serve because they are best equipped and trained to know what stories their readers would find most interesting and newsworthy.

       <para first-indent="16">

         That is precisely why Radio Australia has made this change, and it is a commendable one. These broadcasters are specially trained people, not only selected for their linguistic skills but also obviously selected for their intimate knowledge of the culture and the regions to which they are broadcasting.

         I will conclude this answer by giving Senator Crane the statistical information which may be of interest to him and which is directly pertinent to his question. There are 38 broadcasters employed: 14 of them are in fact citizens of Australia; 23 of them are permanent residents of Australia, which means that they have actually been in this country for a significant period of time; and only one of these broadcasters is neither a citizen nor a permanent resident.

         The `must run' stories are `must run' stories; the broadcasters are not allowed to alter any of the copy. They simply have to deliver it as it is written in the newsroom. All of the copy is prepared in the newsroom by Australian journalists, so the stories that are produced originally are all produced by Australian journalists. But the choice of which secondary stories to run is a matter for the skills of the broadcasters, who choose them according to what they believe would be interesting in the areas to which they are broadcasting.

         I can assure Senator Crane that there is still overall editorial control of what goes out. I am concerned to hear his claim that 10 per cent of the `must run' stories are not run, because they must be run. If Senator Crane, or anyone else, can provide me with specific information supporting these claims, I can assure him that the matter will be investigated thoroughly.

         â€”I want to refer the Minister to the answer provided on the question of plagiarism in the ABC. I asked this question of Mr Hill and, to his credit, he did appear to take it quite seriously. The answer that has been provided is a lengthy one which deals in particular with the Copyright Act and, to a lesser degree, with the guidelines. But the significant thing is that the ABC editorial and program policy guidelines, as amended to June 1991, contain no specific reference to the issue of plagiarism.

         The Minister will recall that I raised the question because it had become very topical in the print media, with a particular journalist with the Fairfax organisation in Melbourne losing his position because he had plagiarised an English article. There had also been other examples of plagiarism in the print media. Many of us who had been listening to an interchange that occurred regularly between Paul Lyneham and Andrew Olle noted that there was never any reference or source given for information which, quite clearly, sometimes came from the print media.

         I have noted, on the odd occasion I have heard that interchange between those two gentlemen since I raised the point, that Mr Lyneham has in fact acknowledged a particular journalist's by-line.

In saying that I have noticed an improvement and that I am pleased Mr Hill took the matter seriously and that it has been answered in a serious way, I still think it would be a better solution to go one step further and include it in the guidelines.

        The Minister answered quite differently. He congratulated Radio Australia on the changes and said it was quite sensible because the people who, I guess, are in the outer reaches select the stories. He said that was advantageous because they knew what the local situation was, and such situations can be quite different.

         I have a further question regarding Radio Australia. As I understand it, we now have a situation where contracted radio producers are coming in and preparing programs during the week which are then broadcast over the weekends. I understand that the reason behind that move is to avoid overtime and additional costs. If that is being done, it obviously means that the staff who used to work on the weekends would cease to have a useful function in preparing and putting together programs. Have there been any retrenchments with regard to the staff of Radio Australia because of the changed policy?

What is the subsidy provided to each service? In answer to the first two questions, the Minister said that the future of AN's former regional passenger service is under consideration following a determination by an independent arbiter who advised that the Adelaide to Mount Gambier line should not close. The Minister said that AN has advised that the existing rolling stock is life expired and cannot be used to reinstate service and consequently AN has been asked to provide advice on options available for the provision of a passenger service between Adelaide and Mount Gambier and other routes formerly served by AN's regional passengers. The Minister then went on to give the subsidy per passenger.

Considering the distance between Mount Gambier and Adelaide, one could just about fly that route for about $100.

         â€”I do not think I need to be more precise than to say it is currently around 200. That is, in fact, the sort of figure that one would expect to be the minimum needed on a waterfront. A level of idle time is always a component of waterfront operations because of the nature of the industry. The difficulty is that that is the case, and the reason why the option of casual labour is just not a workable option any more is that people no longer sling bags on their backs with hooks; they now operate very expensive and often very sophisticated equipment. The answer to the question is that it is around that figure which is quite a reasonable level for normal industry operations.

I was going to say that the Minister is aware, but he may be aware, that earlier today I raised in the consideration of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy an issue of policy that was also jointly developed by the Department of Transport and Communications. This is the paper that was presented to us in the Estimates Committee which detailed the Government's responses to 24 recommendations arising from the special transport conference convened by Mr Snowdon, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, in Alice Springs in March of this year.

I now ask whether Senator Collins is able to confirm, with regard to the work that has been done by departmental officials that was adopted by the Cabinet and the Government as the Federal Government's response to these 24 recommendations, that the initiatives and proposals that are to be put forward by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Premiers Conference as a matter of policy in the area of transport later this month in Perth, are consistent with the comments on the 24 recommendations that were presented to us several weeks ago by this Department and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy jointly.

What concerns me is that the initiatives and proposals being presented to that conference by the Federal Government, by the Prime Minister, are, in effect, a reflection of the Cabinet decisions taken a month or so ago that resulted in a response to a report that was tabled in this Parliament as part of the official response to questions asked in the Estimates Committee. We asked the questions and that solicited and brought forward the 24 recommendations arising from Mr Snowdon's conference in March.

I would, however, mention that two reservations in Estimates Committee A are unusual in that they contain arguments about senators' particular reservations. There is nothing in the Standing Orders preventing reservations being attached to reports in this form. Nevertheless, I would ask honourable senators to consider listing reservations without debate in a similar way to the method used by the majority of other senators.

         â€”I will leave it after this, but I did have a sort of suspicion that it might have been a backdoor version of trying to make a point along the way. However, I accept the point that you make, that it is quite in accordance with the Standing Orders. Certainly, Senator Short and I signed our particular reservation quite deliberatelyâ€”Senator O'Chee signed his because he had to go overseas and was not present when the signatures had to be made availableâ€”and with full knowledge of what we were saying. We considered them to be quite proper. Now perhaps we will just move on.

         â€”Obviously when we come to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button will be handling it. However, I wanted to make a very brief response to the question to which you, Mr Chairman, and Senator Bishop made reference concerning the allocation of departments to Estimates committees. I do not want to divert us on to that now, but I simply indicate that I do have some concern about what seems to be a misallocation of resources. Senator Bishop asked whether I wanted to complain about the volume of work; I do not expect the volume of work to change, but I think we may need to have a serious look at the allocation of the work, given that one committee is doing twice as many hours as all the others. That does not seem to be efficient use of staff time or of senators' time. But that is not an issue for debate here. However, given that it has been raised, I put it on the record as a matter that can be discussed at some appropriate time between now and the next time when we refer portfolios to Estimates committees.

I would not wish to have a statement that, because the Committee took longer to sit than other committees, it was somehow less efficient. In effect, it is most efficient and the time was well spent.

         â€”To support Senator Bishop's remarks in that respect, I read with interest an article by Senator McMullan in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Canberra Times
         </emphasis>
         two or three weeks ago about the role of Estimates committees. It generally came down to the line, `Well, there was a bit of effort in them, but really they are a pretty tiresome bore'. I guess if I were in government, if I were in Senator McMullan's shoes, I might feel a bit the same way. But I think it is quite an extraordinary thing to say because, as Senator Bishop has said, over the past few years the Estimates committee process has really proved itself to be an extraordinarily beneficial oneâ€”and not just for the political parties. I guess it always tends to help the Opposition rather than the Government, but it is not totally a one-way street. As a Senate, we have elicited a lot of information of great benefit to the general public. Indeed, one of the great problems in being a politician is that you spend your life being snowed by people who do not want you to know things that you ought to know if you are to represent your constituents properly. So, I must say I took some slight offence, some surprised offence, at Senator McMullan's remarks on the Estimates process. I thought it was a fairly inept thing for him to say. We all have the opportunity to be as time efficient as possible, and I think we all try to do that. As Senator Bishop says, the time spent in relation to particular
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         </emphasis>
         Estimates committees is often simply a reflection of the significance of the matters with which we are dealing. We did take longer in Estimates A than the other committees, but what came out of that, right across the board in terms of all the departments and agencies with which we dealt, showed that it was really a time efficient process.

         Both of the amendments which I put relate to the multifunction polis. They are covered on pages 120 and 121 of the program performance statement of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. I think that over quite some time now I have stated my concern about the so-called MFP in Adelaide. We have seen recent reports in which the Japanese interests have indicated that they want guaranteed profits. We have seen other statements, both by the Premier of South Australia and by Japanese interests, that without some further inducement the MFP will not proceed. Prior to that and going back quite some considerable time I asked Senator Button a question in the Senate to which he replied that no government money would be spent on the MFP. For all these reasons, not least because a number of members of the Opposition, some in the South Australian Parliamentâ€”notably Jennifer Cashmoreâ€”and some in this Parliament to whom I have spoken privately, have expressed the sorts of concerns which I have expressed, namely, that the MFP is nothing more than a brave attempt to support the Premier of South Australia in his bid for the next election.

         The two amendments that I have moved are to prevent good money going after bad. In relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1), only a request can be made to the House of Representatives. This is a request to reduce the total amount. In relation to that, the total program element listed on page 120 is $1.978m. We are assuming that because the year is half over approximately half of that money would have been spent. So, clearly, we could not make a request that the total amount be removed. Accordingly, the request in this amendment is for a reduction to an amount of $989,000.

         The other amendment is to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) and refers to the amount of $2.772m for a feasibility study into the multifunction polis which, we understand, has not yet commenced; therefore, no money has been expended. Accordingly, we are seeking the total removal of that $2.772m.

         â€”This might be an appropriate time to deal with this matter. When we were dealing with consultants' reports as they were listed, we were having some difficulty in finding any report that did anything useful and was beneficial from a taxpayer's point of view. Instead of going through each consultancy one by one, I made the Minister an offer: choose any three of these reports and present a report to the Committee going through the steps of how and why it was commissioned, what was done with it and what happened as a result of its dissemination, and name three people who benefited in a material way from the publishing of the report. In fact, three such reports were chosen, one relating to the Australian Space Office.

There is no benefit to any individual cited and it just confirmed what I thought, that the reports were almost a make work program.

However, the Minister did agree to their appearing subsequently. I think it is important to note that we would expect someone from the Commission for the Future to continue to appear as that organisation is funded from the Budget by way of appropriation, even though an intent was expressed that there may be a run off over three years and it may then not receive any funding by way of appropriation. In the final analysis, that could not be established as the way in which things would proceed. It may well be that at the end of three years it will get a further appropriation. It is important to adhere to the principle that if an agency is funded it must present for Estimates hearings.

In looking at the regulations that were made pursuant to the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980 and the requirements in the 1989 Act, we see the requirements for registration of a firm to be eligible for a bounty set out and that those requirements are in fact very strict and, in the first instance, are requirements that the Minister shall meet. The Comptroller of Customs has general administration of the Act and is responsible for verifying eligible costs.

         There are several things which have to be established in order that registration for bounty payment purposes occur. One of those is that the Minister shall not register an applicant unless the Minister is satisfied that the applicant has the necessary technical and financial management skills to complete construction, has access to a waterfront site, carries out at least 75 per cent of his activities on vessels between 150 and 10,000 gross construction tonnes and employs at least 40 persons.

         According to the last statement I have been able to obtain from the liquidators, it left debts of $4.5m. The boat yard, which was a major asset of the firm, was encumbered and subsequently sold at auction to none other than Mr Cantor, who bought it for less than its value. The owners of Runmere had to make up the difference out of the sale of their houses to satisfy the debt to the bank.

         â€”I think we dealt with this issue at the Estimates Committee hearing. Let me just make the point again. What happened with the shipyard was that when the yard building the boat failed financially there was a transmission of the company assets to the new shipbuilder. There was the same site, the same yard and the same work force. In those circumstances, having received advice from the Australian Customs Service about the matter, I was satisfied. I am told that, in Queensland, Customs engages the services of a former master mariner to make these assessments and, on the basis of that assessment, I was satisfied within the criteria laid down in the relevant Act.

         As a matter of fact, the company that was registeredâ€”Runmere Pty Ltdâ€”did not have those skills. It failed in just over two years, went into liquidation and left massive debts. In just a moment I will go to the question of whether the Minister's attention should have been alerted to one particular director who had a history that might have led to the matter being queried. What methodology is used by the Minister, and the people to whom he presumably delegates authority, to ensure that people have technical and financial management skillsâ€”the sorts of skills that have not been evidenced in this case?

Nobody receives bounty money until the work is done. It is a bounty payable on production. It is a production bounty. One does not get paid until the work is done. In that circumstance, the examination of the character, the colour of the eyes, the sexual behaviours of the directors of the company are not relevant matters.

If that is the way in which the Minister administers his Department, it is just as well he is leaving. It is just not good enough. Let us go back to the facts of the matter. Yes, bounty payment is made once the work is done, but the point is that before one can get to the position of being paid for work done one must be registered in accordance with the Act and the Act requires the Minister to do certain things. At the moment there is no evidence that the Minister complies with his own legislation.

         Was there not a shipbuilding company which built a boat for Mr Eliadakis? Bounty payments were made and an EFIC loan was made. Mr Eliadakis and the boat and the loan and the repayments disappeared. A further loan of $10m was to be advanced to the same shipbuilding company, part of that payment was made, and the boat was never built because the person disappeared, yet one of the people who is involved in that subsequently became a director of companies which are in receipt of bounty payment. Does the Minister think that spells out a good track record for himself? Does the Minister think any reasonable man or any court of law might think that is a proper way in which to administer an Act for which he has responsibility? A simple yes or no will do.

In fact, I must support what Senator Bishop has said, because the fact that the company is in liquidation means that the claim against the company is a provable debt and is not, in a strict legal sense, sub judice because the admissibility of the proof of debt is something on which the liquidator rules. Clearly, because of that, Senator Button's argument is incorrect and the defence he has mounted against the very severe and important accusation by Senator Bishop is of course invalid. I think there is a lot of truth and a lot of importance in what Senator Bishop has said. For Senator Button merely to dismiss it by saying it is sub judice when that is not the case I think does Senator Bishop and the importance of this matter a grave disservice.

Mr Hardy, who is running the boat yard for him, has been involved previously in two companies which have gone into liquidation and he is now running this shipyard. It seems that Mr Cantor has come back to EFIC and asked for more money to be loaned to what he terms `potential clients', for guarantees to be given by EFIC, and for more bounty payments to be made because, according to his own evidence when he was interviewed on Channel 9, without EFIC, Austrade and the bounty payments he simply could not do business.

         Mr Cantor made an approach to yet another person in the shipbuilding industry and wanted to place equity in that company. On the promise of so doing, he was introduced to certain individuals in Indonesia who may have been interested in having boats built. Upon his making those contacts, Mr Cantor was suddenly no longer interested in making the equity investment in the Australian design company. In fact, he went to an American company to use its design when, incidentally, the design company in Australia had been in receipt of an R&amp;D grantâ€”yet more government coffers.

I have asked the Minister again and again to give me an undertaking that the likes of Mr Cantor will not be given more taxpayers' and government money; that he will not be given further loans; or, more particularly, that loans will not be made to people who will do business with him or the shipyard that he now has control of which is registered for bounty payments; and that he will not be paid the bounty payments from taxpayers' money in order that he can enjoy the lifestyle that we, as Australian people, seem to be providing him with.

They also monitor the outcomes of all contract flying. Two officers are involved with the assessment and payment of accounts. Four officers are located in the same northern regional centres as Skywest and fly regularly with the crews to check the serviceability of aircraft and equipment and the performance of the crews as they work. Two Canberra-based officers also fly regularly to check the four regional checking officers for consistency.

         The concern was that here were these investigations and a not very satisfactory outcome. The answer supplied is really less than satisfactory as well. I asked for a breakdown of costs of individual cases that were brought and I was told that, according to Customs, that is not really very meaningful at this stage. I disagree. It is, in fact, very meaningful. I asked how much each investigation has incurred to dateâ€”how much was involved. I ask the Minister whether he would instruct his Department please to provide the information as requested, that is, how much did those investigations cost per case? If proper records are being kept it should not be very difficult.

I will make a few points which might be helpful. The investigation subprogram has three separate functions: investigations, intelligence and prosecutions. In this last area of prosecutions there seems to be some misunderstanding. That section processes all briefs of evidence prepared by the whole operational area of the Australian Customs Service including those which are passed on to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Australian Government Solicitor for prosecution. Talking about aggregate figures, and trying to work out what this investigation subprogram costs and appropriate those costs individually to the results of individual prosecutions, is an exercise which cannot be done in the way Senator Bishop tried to do it in the course of the Senate Estimates, because of that much wider function of the prosecutions branch.

         In respect of one or two other matters I can give the chamber further information. True, 532 investigation subprogram cases were initiated in 1990-91, of which 247 related to quarantine, fauna, prohibited imports and non-commercial revenue cases of that kind. These were not fraud cases at all. I remember that the former Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, brought in some seeds once and Customs questioned him about that. That was essentially a quarantine matter. It had to be investigated. It might have led to a prosecution. That is an example of the 247 cases to which I referred. Taking 247 from 532 leaves 285 which were commercial fraud cases initiated in the year, with an estimated $23.9m in revenue being avoided.

         These fraud cases typically take more than one year to complete, and the majority of them have not been completed at this timeâ€”or at any particular time. It is not meaningful to discuss costs and outcomes in respect of the fraud cases, just looking at it on a yearly snap like that. The figure of $54.9m that has been mentioned by Senator Bishop in respect of fraud cases relates to all cases handled or partially handled during 1990-91. It includes, for example, a major investigation still proceeding into the illegal diversion of spirits, with an estimated $20m in revenue avoided. Again, it is meaningless to compare fraud estimates with results achieved during the year, because many of the cases have just not been completed.

         I said earlier that this program is broken down into three componentsâ€”investigation, intelligence and prosecution. The cost to run the investigation subprogram was $14.8m. In 1990-91, 327 commercial cases were completed in total. As well as the 45 cases that proceeded to prosecution, there were cases that were settled or handled by other means, such as administrative penalty or call up of duty owing. There were 130 cases where the evidence available did not justify action. I hope that is of some help to the honourable senator in understanding the program.

        Very simply, the program performance statement deals quite succinctly with the three arms the Minister has just described, but none of those change the fact that his Department set out in these notes the information that 532 investigation cases were initiated during the year, with a total value of $54.9m, but that it managed to bring only 45 cases. In the event, as the Minister says, that some cases take longer to investigate and to bring to prosecutionâ€”and we were told that we could expect to see details of those in the statements for the coming yearâ€”equally it would apply that investigations commenced within the past two years ought to have come to fruition in this current year. In other words, whichever way we look at it, 45 out of 532 is a pretty lousy average, and to recover $3.9m when the Department is looking for $54.9m really is not a great batting average either.

How much did each fraud investigation case cost to prosecute? What was the total cost to Customs of the investigation of the 532 cases?

         The reason we went on to deal with the question of educational requirements or job specifications for people who are recruited into the investigation service is that, if we are not getting the satisfactory result, it is valid to look at the composition. It may well be that we are desperately in need of more qualified people to get a better result. That is a point we can explore in another place. I suppose one could be excused for not expecting there to be a job specification when I recall that the Minister gave us evidence that he employed a deputy secretary without even having a job specification.

         I now turn to the question of triple dipping and the answer provided by Customs on this practice. To refresh people's minds as to what that practice is: it is where the appropriate form has been filled out with an error in it concerning the import of goods. The error is registered against not only the Customs agent as the individual who signs the form, but his firm as well and, more particularly, the importer himself. This practice was to be tested as to whether or not it was valid. That question was conveniently avoided by Customs granting a 100 per cent remission and therefore denying the AAT any jurisdiction.

         However, we were informed that Customs has ceased this practice as and from the Walker case which was decided at the end of 1990. Indeed, the answer that is provided contains one of those nice equivocal points and says, in effect, that triple dipping no longer occurs where one of the parties accepts responsibility. Of course, the immediate question that comes to mind is what happens where no party admits responsibility. Presumably then, the triple dipping exercise still continues.

         â€”Two parties are held responsible in the manner to which I referred earlier, and ultimately one party is penalised. Senator Bishop asked me whether the system works totally satisfactorily. I think the answer to that question is that I cannot say, but I think the changes that have been made need the opportunity to work. I will keep an eye on the system.

         â€”I am grateful that the Minister will keep an eye on it. It is not two parties, it is three: the individual agent; his firm; and the importer. It is not the case that only one party can be penalised. All three can be penalised because the black mark goes against all threeâ€”as the Minister has now establishedâ€”where there is no agreement as to who is the responsible party. So, perhaps when we next meet on this issue, we could ask Customs to keep a list of those instances where no party accepts the particular responsibility and the practice still continues. It would be useful to know the number of cases where this occurs because there are people who have drawn to my attention the fact that this has happened to them and placed them in hardship. One particular gentleman is involved, with the sum of $1,700 for an error which has never been his. He is placed in particular hardship and his situation has been exacerbated as a result of the recession that this Government has designed. Could I have a confirmation that the Customs Service will keep a register of the number of cases, and the particular cases where there is no agreement as to who is responsible, and the process of triple dipping continues?

         â€”In the period intervening between the Estimates hearings and today, I endeavoured, firstly through the Committee Secretary, Mr Hamburger, to obtain a copy of the Austrade report, at least in draft form. After much discussion one way and another, it was agreed that Austrade would make available to the Committee copies of the draft report after it had been seen by the board. That was to follow the return of the new Managing Director, Mr Evans, from overseas at the end of the October. I received the draft on Monday of this week.

         I was quite surprised when I went through the report to find that it had no financial statement in it and no list of consultants. I thereupon asked Mr Hamburger to inquire further as to when we could expect this material. He was told, and subsequently told me, that the financial statements were not in an appropriate form and Austrade had no intention of publishing a list of consultants. I decided to speak directly with an officer of Austrade and did so. After some deliberations, we were successful in obtaining a copy of the financial statements.

         However, the question of the list of consultants is somewhat more difficult. I was told that it could not be made available for some days. I then said that I presumed Austrade would keep a list of consultants and I would be happy to receive, for the purposes of the Committee of the Whole, a list of all those people who had been employed as consultants and the cost, and that if the board subsequently wanted to sanitise or otherwiseâ€”again that wonderful phrase `commercial-in-confidence' â€”the purpose or the subject of the consultancy undertaken we could perhaps wait a few days for that if it was a difficult matter. That I thought was agreed to, until this morning, when I received a most amazing document that listed no names of consultants but simply the areas of consultancy. They add up to $6.869m; not a bad little consultancy billâ€”nearly $7m. There was a discussion as to why I thought the Committee and the Senate were entitled to see these lists. In report No. 309 tabled in this Parliament by the Public Accounts Committee, recommendation 5.31 acknowledged:

        To date, the Government has not, by way of a Finance minute, replied to this report; but the findings of the Committee were well researched and represent the views of both sides of the House. I presume that the Government will deal favourably with that report. Accordingly, I felt that it was only proper to be asking for that list, because that is the expression and the will of the Parliament.

         We have come to the stage where we are looking at the appropriation for Austrade. I came upon another piece of information this morning that, quite frankly, appalled me. Mr Downer, my colleague in the other place, the shadow Minister for trade, had found it unusual that Mr Evans, the new Managing Director, and other officers in Austrade would not speak with him. He could think of a variety of reasons why that may be the case, except that one of those officers happened to be a friend of his and he would not speak to Mr Downer either. He found this very curious.

         As and from 1 November, suddenly all those officers were quite available to speak to Mr Downer. What happened? On 1 November, Austrade moved out of the area of responsibility of DITAC and Senator Button and went into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. What he ascertained, and what I have ascertained, is that Senator Button instructed officers of Austrade not to speak to Mr Downer at all. I find that utterly preposterous. I ask the Minister: on what basis can he justify an instruction to officers in the Public Service not to speak to an elected member of this Parliament and somebody who is charged with the responsibility in that area?

         The second point I wish to make is that if a shadow Minister wants to talk to officers of my Department or officers of statutory authorities in my portfolio and in any other portfolio, most of them observe the courtesy of writing to me or the relevant Minister saying, `I would like to meet with these officers of the statutory authority or these officers of the Department'. Senator Bishop is not on the front bench, but I would like to let her know that most shadow Ministers do that. If a shadow Minister writes to me making such a request, I say yes as a matter of practice and principle. That never happened.

         It is true that Mr Evans, as the new chief executive of Austrade, in the presence of some other Austrade officers said to me, `We think we should give a briefing to Mr Downer'. They approached Mr Downer about giving him a briefing. That was about the start of October, or late September.

         I said, `No. Mr Downer has not sought a briefing'. I discussed it with Dr Blewett, under whose aegis Austrade was to come on 1 November. We agreed, as Ministers, that as soon as Dr Blewett took over responsibility for Austrade, Mr Downer, who had not requested a briefing of me, would be offered one by Austrade officers. That is what happened. So when Senator Bishop starts off by saying that what I have done, presumably, is preposterous, I apply that same adjective to the allegations which she has just made.

No doubt the Minister will provide me with the information as to where it is. Note 16 on page 27 of the accounts deals with borrowings. The report says that the reschedulings and borrowings were authorised by the Commonwealth and approvals for the borrowings were given by the Treasurer under section 79 of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985. However, subsequent to the execution of the borrowing documentation, the Attorney-General's Department issued a legal opinion in which it advised that it was outside the functions of the Commission to borrow to fund the Commonwealth's share of liabilities under national interest contracts. Although the contracts entered into remained valid pursuant to section 96 of the Act, the Commonwealth has reaffirmed its intention to indemnify the Commission against all losses incurred in relation to default under the forgiveness of such rescheduled debt and all costs relating to the borrowings. The report goes on to say that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act, which went through this chamber only recently, in fact will empower EFIC to borrow in relation to the national interest contract.

         I have a problem with that statement. Section 96 of the Act, as I read it, can in no way validate an act by the old fund which was not authorised in the enabling legislation. Indeed, because I was of that view, I investigated the matter a little further. I understand that there was not a single legal opinion issued by the Attorney-General's Department as this note states; that in fact competing legal statements exist; that indeed it was DITAC that obtained the first legal opinion which stated that the borrowings were illegal. It obtained that opinion because of its exposure to the Kuwaiti loans.

         However, I understand that another opinion was then sought from a more junior member of the Attorney-General's office which purports to say that maybe section 96 saves the borrowings. I ask the Minister to make both those legal opinions available to this chamber because it seems to me that what is required is further legislation to validate those borrowings. I ask that both those legal opinions be tabled. I understand one opinion is by Mr Peter Clay. I do not know the name of the author of the other opinion, except that he is more junior. I would further ask why the statement in these financial statements is not in fact correct.

         The point of the question is that these statements are misleading in that they say there is a single opinion which finds that the borrowings were illegal and that they are saved by section 96. They in fact are not. The opinion is silent, as I understand it, so I want to see the first opinion. I would also like to see the competing opinion to see whether it in fact expresses a view that section 96 operates in any way to save those borrowings. The only way this can be determined is for us to see those opinions.

         Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that we may require additional legislation. Already the draftsman has taken the care to insert into the new EFIC Bill provision to give power for those borrowings. It is because of the borrowings that took place post-1985 until the splitting of Austrade and EFIC and the efficacy of the new Bill that we have a problem.

That means that he knowingly allowed EFIC to go on borrowing in an illegal fashion without having any remedy. That is perhaps precisely the reason he does not want to release the opinionâ€”it would show that he was not competent in this area. Is Mr Peter Clay's opinion dated 1988?

The former managing director's remuneration package included part payment of an interest only housing loan until 31 July 1993. The estimated total payments applying interest rates existing at balance date for the period 1 July 1991 to 31 July 1993 is in the order of $80,000.

I told Senator Bishop the answer to that question about eight minutes ago. The answer to that question about eight minutes ago was that I had to approve the housing loan element of the package.

        We then go on to discuss the matter of Mr David Combe. The next question I want to ask, which is directly relating to that consultancy payment, is this: was that payment of a further $30,000 by way of consultancy payment, as set out in the reservation to the report, in addition to the termination package that was paid to Mr McAlister? What was the reason? We have never had a satisfactory reason for the payment of that consultancy fee.

         In discussing the Resource Assessment Commission, references I shall make to pages shall relate to pages as enumerated in volume 3 of the additional information received. It is interesting to note that at page 103 of volume 3 of the additional information it was first identified in about December 1990 that there was some sort of peculiarity in the values that people assigned to the area in question. It states:

         This matter remained all the way through the life of the examination of the contingent valuation survey. For example, it was subject to a discussion in a paper that appears to have been prepared in around April 1991. At that point the officer who produced this minute paper, at page 69 of volume 3, went into some detail about other contingent valuation surveys that had been conducted in Australia and the relationship between place of residence and the willingness to pay which is, of course, the basis of the contingent valuation survey.

         It is interesting to note that visitors to Fraser Island were identified as being more willing to pay than those who had not been there. Visitors to the Great Barrier Reef were more willing to pay to prevent the crown-of-thorns starfish than those who had not visited the reef. Yet in the minute paper from the Assistant Secretary of the research branch dated 2 April 1991, and contained on pages 67 to 68, it is noted that those who had not visited Kakadu National Park were willing to pay significantly less than those who had. And in this particular case the figures were $24.60 and $95.56 respectively.

         Could the officers provide the Minister with some explanation as to the discrepancy between the Kakadu contingent valuation survey and the other contingent valuation surveys that have shown that people who have actually visited were more willing to pay for the preservation of these sites than those who had not. It seems in this particular case that Kakadu displays certain statistical peculiarities that are certainly not common to the others. Are the officers in a position to provide Senator McMullan with an explanation as to why the Kakadu survey is so different from the other ones?

The sheer mass of information contained in these advices and the period over which they took place show that a lot of taxpayers' money was expended on it. If this method is going to be used in future studies by the Resource Assessment Commission, it is very disconcerting that faith is being placed in a method of survey that cannot even replicate its results from one survey to another.

         It is interesting to note that, in the advice dated 2 April 1991 from Mr Clive Hamilton, the Assistant Secretary of the research branch, appearing on page 68 of the additional information, he suggests that one of the explanations may be that people close to the resource are more likely to know about the resource. If Mr Hamilton is indeed correct in proposing that explanation, that would seem to contradict the validity of the contingent valuation survey in respect of the Kakadu conservation area. In particular, it would tend to argue against the validity of that survey in respect of the mining of Coronation Hill.

         â€”The two options Senator O'Chee outlined are possible interpretations of the facts, but it was not an exhaustive list of the options. It is important to get the contingent valuation survey into some sort of perspective. It is an internationally accepted technique for attempting to measure the value people place on factors such as the environment. It is a technique the Resource Assessment Commission feels it has an obligation to assess and continue to endeavour to apply in the Australian context.

         I do not want to suggest that in any way it has been a major element of decision making by the Resource Assessment Commission or the Government in this matter.

         â€”I thank Senator McMullan for that comment. As a result of the inquiry and the contingent valuation survey on Kakadu National Park, I think even the Resource Assessment Commission is saying that it is merely a tool, and not a definitive tool. But this was also the subject of discussion which was contained in the advices given by the Resource Assessment Commission. It is interesting to note that at some stage prior to the final report being brought out there was discussion in a memo from, I believe, Mr Clive Hamilton expressing some concern as to how it should be treated in the final report.

         I cannot find the particular advice at hand immediately, and I will not delay the Committee over long by looking for it. From recollection, Mr Hamilton said, `We can't dump the contingent valuation survey because we'll look silly, but the results are peculiar and we can't put all our weight on them as well'. It seems very clear from that that at least within the Commission there were two schools of thought as to the value of this survey. Given that there were clearly two schools of thought as to the value of it, I think we need to have a very close look at whether we continue to use it.

         But I must take issue with a comment that Senator McMullan has made as to the wide use of the contingent valuation survey. Certainly, it has been widely used, but from the evidence contained in the advice of Ms Leanne Wilkes on 5 April 1991, it certainly has not been widely relied upon. I think there is a difference between its being widely used and being widely relied upon. For example, Anne Fisher who was interviewed on 12 March 1991â€”she is from Pennsylvania State University and, interestingly enough, is formerly from the Environmental Protection Agency in the United Statesâ€”said:

        According to Ms Keely, despite the fact that the US government funds many CV studies, this does not necessarily translate into the direct use of CV data for policy making.

        It is very clear that although this stuff is done and the surveys are conducted in other places, they are not used as the basis of decision making. The question I raise, and the question I think many concerned taxpayers would raise, is: if they are not going to be used, why bother doing it at all?

Nobody has claimed they are widely relied upon; it is a tool under international assessment as part of the tools of analysis used by decision makers as bodies around the world are endeavouring to grapple with the very complex elements of decision making in the areas into which we are all having to go due to the demands of the 1990s and beyond in order to balance environmental and development factors and other things.

         of Mr O'Sullivan's remarks here, but from my recollection of them and those which Senator Short quotedâ€”which do not contradict my recollection, although of course they are more specificâ€”I understood him to be saying that the report will be considered at that meeting, that is the formal place for it and no decision can be made before the meeting. To say `We will make a decision about that' implies he might be going to say `No'; it does not mean he will necessarily say, `Yes'. As a matter of logic, if the report comes before that body for decision, it is open to that body to make a decision which is, `No, we will not do that'. So I do not think one can assume there is not going to be a decision. As I understand it, the Prime Minister simply conveyed his view about what the decision is likely to be.

That is just ridiculous if the Commonwealth has already said, through the Prime Minister, that so far as it is concerned it will not be a party to any such decision.

So we are getting away now from the data to the methodology, and I think that relates more to that point.

         â€”Yes, I think that does relate to the methodology rather than the data. Therefore, I come back to the data. There are at least three things: there is the raw data; there is the manipulationâ€”to use the Treasury's own wordsâ€”that is done to the data; there is the modelling; and then there is the final outcome. Unless there is stage 2, which is the manipulation done to the raw data, it is not possible for anyone else to follow the process or to be able to examine and understand fully any modelling or any outcome result. Unless the Department is prepared to make available the manipulation and what has been done to the data, then it is not really providing anything worth while at all, in my view. I want to know whether that will be made available.

         â€”I cannot go beyond what I have said. As Senator Button said in response to Senator Short's question on notice, it is intended that full details of the modelling methodology will be published once the model is up and running. That is the information that is available at the moment. There is also the material provided today concerning the data, and I think that has gone a fair way towards meeting Senator Short's concerns. It is always possible to envisage that something could slip between the cracks; as I see it at the moment, that is unlikely. One cannot disprove things in advance but, putting together the various answers, I think we are getting towards meeting Senator Short's concern and we will see whether there are any further problems as it develops. I cannot say anything more at the moment.

Can Senator McMullan tell me whether, in that extensive material, the Government is includingâ€”as he told us in the Estimates hearingsâ€”material which will enable it to test our costings on the goods and services tax, and where that data is coming from?

Irrespective of whether they were, New South Wales and Tasmania have commenced publishing Forward Estimates, which of course helps enormously in understanding the budgetary and financial economic position of those governments. Is the Federal Government giving any thought to following the lead of Tasmania and New South Wales and, if not, why not?

My point is: why is such participation not a mandatory condition of the sale? To privatise the airlines, or any other government business undertaking, and to not make automatic provision for favourable employee share participation is, in my viewâ€”and certainly in the view of the coalitionâ€”a very significant detraction from the real advantages of privatisation, one fundamental value of which is to increase the spread of share ownership throughout the general community, and particularly to assist in the workplace participation and involvement of employees. It is quite extraordinary that it has not been made mandatory in this case. If it has not been made mandatory, I hope that the Government would look at changing its view on that very important situation.

         â€”The officers here have not heard of the allegation to which Senator Bishop refers. If it were to be true, it would be serious. I will, of course, ensure that some investigation takes place. I want to place on the record my concernâ€”I understand how these matters ariseâ€”that we are now likely to have a situation where doubt is cast over many people until this investigation is resolved. With the throwing of this allegation into the air, because it is so vague and could be attributed to any of dozens of people, I am concerned that when these allegations are made in these Estimates and appropriations processes, they have the potential to reflect on the integrity of a lot of honest people. The allegation gets publicity, but should it prove not to be correct the denial very rarely receives similar publicity. I want to put that on the record at the same time as I give an assurance that I will ensure that the matter is investigated.

I will not deal with the finding of the matter or the method in which it was dealt with before the Human Rights Commission, although I am aware of the manner in which it was settled. My concern relates to the method in which the matter was dealt with by Senate officers from the time of the incident, which was 1988, and the cost that has been incurred to the public purse because of the handling of the matter, which has resulted in the person concerned being given compensation under Comcare because she was too stressed to work. It meant that further cost was incurred because a replacement had to be hired in her place while she was off work.

         The reason I am concerned is that there is ample evidence supplied by a report written by Mr Cleaver Elliott, Clerk-Assistant (Management), on 20 October 1988, and a further report which was sought on 10 December 1990 from Mallesons Stephen Jaques and the manner in which these two reports were dealt with.

         Failure to take action has resulted in stress for the person concerned. She was finally put in a position where she had to take action. On 10 December, Mallesons Stephen Jaques reported in response to a request from Mr Vander Wyk for an appraisal of the evidence on both standards of proofâ€”that is, balance of probabilities, which is the standard of proof applicable for harassment, and beyond reasonable doubt, which is the criminal standard that is applicable, as I said, for matters of a criminal nature.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, I consider that the incident occurred. The varying accounts given by K make it difficult to establish exactly what occurred. However, I do not regard those variations as being sufficient to put the incident as a whole into doubt. The proper finding must be that the incident was of a substantial nature and broadly as K alleges.

        There are further findings through the report. It says:

        S did make an advance in K's room which was rejected by her. I consider that the circumstantial evidence of the events, both before and after the incident, do not leave room for doubt that K's account is substantially true. I have doubts that the incidents occurred as K alleges in her most detailed account, but I am satisfied that beyond a reasonable doubt S made a significant sexual advance to K in the room.
       </para>
       <para>
        The findings are pretty straightforward. Finally the report says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . except to say that the application of a higher standard of proof in relation to certain allegations may well be appropriate in the context of section 56 of the Public Service Act, although I accept that proof on the balance of probabilities only is required in relation to a formal complaint of sexual harassment. In any event my own findings were reached firstly on the application of proof of the balance of probabilities and then subsequently beyond reasonable doubt. I did not approach the evidence with a variable standard.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, the report criticises the earlier report by Mr Elliott that I mentioned on the basis that different standards of proof were applied. The report further says:

         â€”The matter I raise relates to the problems of the management of the Library mentioned in the reservations. I do not want to take the time of the Committee now, but I have a copy of an audit report from the Australian National Audit Office dated 24 September 1991, dealing with the fact that the Library breached section 83 of the Constitution in that the Library simply ran out of money to pay its salaries. It subsequently did apply for a further advance from the Advance to the Presiding Officers, but the problem is that the payment was made before the advance was sought.

         The significant feature was that the Library did not know it had run out of money; it only knew it had run out of money when the Department of Finance rang up and told it. It is a serious matter that needs to be added to the other matters we dealt with. We are in the process of having that management put in order, and I think this sort of matter needs to be dealt with and have attention paid to it by the new set of management that is now in the Library. That is why I have raised the matter.

          â€”What Senator Bishop has just said is correct. The Australian National Audit Office has qualified the financial statements of the Department of the Parliamentary Library for the financial year ended 30 June 1991. The qualification relates to expenditure by the Library at the end of the 1990-91 Supply period which was in excess of its warrant authority and appropriation under the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1990-91. A breach of section 83 of the Constitution and the Audit Act 1901 therefore has occurred.

          Warrant authority pursuant to the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 1990-91 was not received until 11 December 1990. The Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1990-91 had appropriated, in line with usual practice, five-twelfths of the anticipated 1990-91 administrative expenditure of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, plus salaries based on the paydays which would fall in the period for which Supply was expected, based on previous years experience, to be neededâ€”that is, to the end of November. Because of the lateness of appropriations becoming available, Supply period funds were required to cover 12 paydays, as opposed to the 11 originally anticipated. The failure was in not monitoring expenditure closely and relating that to the clearly slower than usual passage of the Appropriation Bills through the Parliament.

          On Wednesday, 5 December 1990â€”the day before the additional paydayâ€”an approach was made to the President and the Speaker by the Parliamentary Librarian for an allocation of $300,000 from the joint advance to meet salary payments due on 6 December 1990. However, the salaries expenditure had already been processed by the Department of Finance on 3 December 1990, along with other expenditure, which combined to cause the breach of the Constitution and the Audit Act. The qualification affected approximately $200,000 of the Parliamentary Library's 1990-91 expenditure, or 2 per cent of the total. During this Supply period, Library expenditure against appropriations is being closely monitored by Library management and a similar situation will not arise in the future.

        This Bill would adjust the Medicare benefits arrangements to encourage more appropriate use of medical services and more efficient use of health resources and to provide improved protection for families from high out of pocket gap costs for private medical services.

        The major problem facing Australia's health care system is the growth in use of medical services per person. This growth means that every 20 years the number of medical services per person doubles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That growth is not caused by Medicareâ€”the National Health Strategy has shown that that growth has been occurring fairly constantly since at least 1976. The cause is an open ended fee for service system underwritten by insuranceâ€”whether public or private.
       </para>

        The National Health Strategy has indicated that an integrated approachâ€”that addresses the demand and supply sides togetherâ€”could have a major impact on growth in use of medical services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That is what the Government proposes. Details are set out in Budget Related Paper No. 9. This Bill would implement the first parts of the package of measures the Government envisages. Further measures will be discussed with the medical profession over coming monthsâ€”with the Government intending to implement further changes from 1 July 1992. As a result of the Caucus working party review of the reforms to Medicare, the Government has now agreed to commit up to $12 million to demonstration general practice grants in 1991-92, keeping in mind the general aims of the formal program due to commence on 1 July 1992.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The measures contained in this Bill have been subjected to a comprehensive review process and have been refined as a result of this process. I am therefore confident that the revised package of reforms will provide a sound basis for containing health expenditure and encouraging the more efficient use of health resources. It will address the problem of inappropriate service patterns and encourage a more selective use of medical services through the introduction of a judicious price signal while providing improved protection for families, the chronically ill and heavy users of medical services. Finally the reforms provide a clear signal that the Government supports the ongoing role of bulk billing.

        Medicare benefit for prescribed out-of-hospital general practitioner consultation items for non-concessionary benefits would be reduced by $3.50 from 1 December 1991. This reduction would increase to $5 from 1 November 1992 and be indexed annually from then on. For bulk-billed services where the benefit is reduced, general practitioners would be able to charge non-concessionary patients a co-payment of up to $2.50. When the additional $1.00 fee for bulk billed services is added to the $2.50 maximum copayment, the net income for a doctor who bulk bills remains unaffected by these changes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government recognises the administrative efficiencies and lower costs which result from processing bulk billed claims compared with patient billed claims for general practice services. It also acknowledges that there are broader benefits which result from bulk billing in terms of cost control and in access to affordable medical services. The introduction through this Bill of an indexed $1.00 additional payment (known as the transaction fee) for each bulk billed service affected by the reduced benefit will recognise these advantages and send a clear signal to doctors that the Government supports bulk billing.

        Currently individuals who incur out of pocket costs for gaps between the Medicare benefit and the Schedule Fee for out of hospital services totalling more than $246 (indexed) in a financial year are entitled to benefits to cover their gap costs up to 100% of the Schedule Fee for out of hospital services for the remainder of the financial year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The threshold would from 1 January 1992 apply to gap expenses incurred by a family as a whole rather than by each individual member of the family.

        The safety-net year would change from the existing financial year to a calendar year basis. This would ensure the extra protection applies as soon as practicable. It would also bring the arrangements into line with those which apply to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

        This represents a substantial improvement in protection for families. Under the current arrangements some families continue to pay gap costs for out of hospital services for some family members even when one or more members have exceeded the threshold figure. The new arrangements should bring relief to those families where one or more members has a chronic condition or who face unexpected high costs because of sudden serious illness in the family.

        The transitional provisions within the Bill provide for the protection of individuals for the period where existing safety net provisions, which apply on a financial year basis, would be overlapped by new provisions, applying retrospectively for the calendar year commencing 1 January 1991. The transitional provisions would take into account the reduction in benefit and the copayment which will apply from 1 December 1991 to 31 December 1991. These provisions also ensure that the potential for "double-dipping" is avoided as a result of the transitional overlap in safety net periods.

Retrospective adjustments would be made, where necessary, to claims already processed for individuals who achieve the safety-net threshold under this transitional arrangement. People who received increased benefits after reaching the threshold in the period 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1991 would not be required to repay those benefits.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill would also provide for indexation of the following: the maximum gap between the Schedule Fee and the Medicare Benefit; the safety-net threshold; the reduction to benefit for the prescribed GP services; the maximum copayment; and the additional fee for bulk billed services. Both the maximum gap and safety-net threshold are indexed under current legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The package of reforms provided for in this Bill represent future changes foreshadowed in the Budget papers; the most significant changes to Australia's health system since the introduction of Medicare. In order to ensure that the community understands the reasons for these changes and what effect they will have on the quality and efficiencies of general practice, $4 million has been allocated over the next two years for patient information and education purposes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clearly there are serious concerns about the cost to the community and the quality of care provided in general practice. The Government has commenced discussions with the medical profession to see how funding arrangements might be further amended to assist the profession in its appropriate role of improving standards of practice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The aim of the discussions is to enable both the profession and the Government to pursue their legitimate roles while ensuring that there is a greater synthesis between the two. It is the responsibility of the profession to set and supervise standards. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure the financing mechanisms permit access to necessary medical services while constraining costs to ensure the long term sustainability of Medicare and assisting the profession to provide high quality care.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Discussions with the profession will centre around the following:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, the use of practice grants to complement fee for service reimbursement. A practice grant would provide some remuneration to those general practices which choose to reduce their reliance on fee for service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This would better target health benefits, since it would offer appropriate financial incentives for practices to engage in best practice care, provide financing arrangements to encourage better integration with the health system and to involve GPs in a wider range of activities. These could be funded through a trade off between providing funds for practice grants and providing funds for Schedule fee increases for GPs' services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Up to $12 million will be provided in 1991-92 to enable demonstration practice grants to be introduced as soon as possible.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, trialing of the use of practice budgets. Under this arrangement a budget is allocated to general practices to cover the costs of diagnostic services and pharmaceuticals. This could build on the Government's other reforms in pharmaceuticals, pathology and radiology. It could also facilitate the trade offs which GPs make between different approaches to the care of their patients and support the role of the GP as the co-ordinator of a network of care. It would be a different approach from that at the moment which relies on counselling by the Health Insurance Commission for doctors who by comparison with their peers appear to use excessive amounts of these services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Third, accreditation of general practices. The Government sees this as a natural development of the vocational registration arrangements. Those arrangements are a form of accreditation, but of individual practitioners. Accreditation would be a matter for the profession, but it could provide a framework within which many steps could be taken to address quality of care issues in general practice. These might include improved quality of training provided to GP trainees through links between accredited practice and academic Departments of general practice in medical schools. Similarly improved continuing education and quality assurance programs could result from these links.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Fourth, supply and distribution of medical practitioners. There are four major aspects for discussion. These are: medical immigration; output of medical schools; the distribution of medical practitioners; and developing alternatives for GPs to help reduce the oversupply problem in urban areas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many other countries have acted to deal with excessive medical immigration. The situation in Australia is now such that it can no longer afford to permit relatively unrestricted entry of overseas medical practitioners.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Fifth, information technology. Information technology could substantially enhance the diagnostic and patient education roles of General Practitioners as well as improving the business management of practices. However, as with other diagnostic equipment the current structures of general practice mean that few practices have sufficient capital base to provide these facilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Over $400,000 has been provided in the 1991-92 Budget to support the work of the Review of Professional Indemnity Arrangements for Health Care Professionals. The Review, established by me in April 1991, will examine and report on current arrangements relating to professional indemnity insurance for health care professionals. It will also examine current experience with compensation for medical misadventure and any difficulties with these current arrangements including problems with service quality, coverage and benefits.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Review will prepare a discussion paper, undertake widespread consultations and prepare a final report, with recommendations for reform, for consideration by the Government in the context of the 1992-93 Budget.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The resources provided in the 1991-92 Budget will enable the Review to prepare its discussion paper, develop options, undertake national consultations, conduct a number of research projects and develop sound costings for possible reform options.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Reform of arrangements for compensation for medical misadventure could assist doctors to significantly improve the quality of care to patients while avoiding unnecessary diagnostic costs which arise from the practice of defensive medicine.

        Conclusion

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I reiterate that this Bill is to enact a number of changes designed to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable, and efficient universal health insurance system.

        As part of the Government's 1991-92 Budgetary measures, I bring before the House a Bill to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill rectifies what has previously been a deficiency in the Legislation, that enabled Medicare benefits to be paid when a medical practitioner rendered a medical service outside the scope of that medical practitioner's limited or restricted State or Territory registration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also includes a new provision which ensures that a patient is fully informed concerning the non availability of Medicare entitlements before a medical service is rendered outside a medical practitioner's State or Territory registration. The Bill includes a provision which requires that a medical practitioner, before rendering a medical service outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration, will be required to give to the patient a notice advising that a Medicare benefit is not payable in respect of such a service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill introduces a penalty provision where, if a medical practitioner who is required to so notify a patient fails to do so, then a penalty, set at a maximum of $2000 may apply.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Also included in the Bill is a discretion for the payment of Medicare benefits, to ensure that patients are not disadvantaged by the proposed new arrangements. This will enable the payment of Medicare benefits for a medical service which is rendered by a medical practitioner outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration and where the medical practitioner fails to inform the patient that Medicare benefits are not payable. For example, such a provision would enable Medicare benefits to be paid where a medical practitioner acting outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration, was required to provide an emergency service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable Senators will be aware, that for some time, the Government has been reviewing the key elements of the Medicare arrangements and, in particular, concerns related to excessive servicing by some medical practitioners.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill introduces a new penalty provision and new referral powers to a Medicare Participation Review Committee, which are considered necessary as deterrents to medical practitioners who render excessive services. These amendments are part of the Government's broad initiatives to control the costs of Medicare.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Medical practitioners, under the current legislation, may be required to appear before a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, which is a committee of medical colleagues, to justify the necessity of the medical services rendered. To the extent that a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry finds that the medical practitioner has excessively serviced, that medical practitioner may be required to repay such Medicare benefits to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth may not be required to pay Medicare benefits for such medical services. The Bill introduces a penalty, in addition to the non-payment or repayment of Medicare benefits, equal to the value of the Medicare payments in respect of those services, which have been found by a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry to have been rendered excessively.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current legislation provides for the establishment of Medicare Participation Review Committees. Such Committees are empowered to review the continued participation of a medical practitioner in the Medicare arrangements, in certain circumstances, and may disqualify a medical practitioner from the Medicare arrangements for up to five years. The Bill introduces new provisions requiring that where a medical practitioner has been found to have rendered excessive services by a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, and has incurred a penalty, on two or more occasions, then such a medical practitioner will be referred to a Medicare Participation Review Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On 1 December 1991 new Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations will be implemented. From these Regulations, it has been common practice to produce the Medicare Benefits Schedule, which is used by medical practitioners in relation to billing patients under Medicare. The Australian National Audit Office, Efficiency Audit Report No. 26, on the Administration of the Medicare Benefits Schedule made four recommendations regarding presentational changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The recommendations regarding the Medicare Benefits Schedule were, in substance, that it be restructured with more logical and appropriate headings to enable easier identification of the Medical Services Items, and thus be more `user friendly'.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To implement the changes, the Bill introduces two technical amendments. These amendments will exclude the restrictive references in the current Legislation to the words "Parts" and "Divisions" to enable more appropriate terms to be used in dividing up the various medical services in the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table)
