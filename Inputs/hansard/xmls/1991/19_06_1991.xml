       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       * That every abortion kills an unborn baby.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That in 1989/90 alone Medicare subsidised 69,587 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of unborn Australian babies by ceasing to subsidise abortions through Medicare by passing the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990 and by all other means at its disposal.

       The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:

         —by leave-I intervene in the debate simply to say that there was a thought that perhaps the skills of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration are more appropriate to an inquiry which is basically dealing with administrative matters within the Department. It is an arguable point that because it is an inquiry into aspects of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the skills of those within the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, because of their particular interest in the subject matters of that Department, might be appropriate. On balance, and through discussions, it was thought that it might be more appropriate to keep the concentration on the more technical questions of administration on security aspects that had been demonstrated to fail rather than give the foreign affairs emphasis to it. The explanation really is as simple as that.

        But I do want to say quickly for the record that I think this is misconceived. It is unnecessary because, in the first place, there is ample opportunity available under existing Estimates committee procedures to explore the kinds of issues which are raised in this reference. That is an opportunity which the Committee has never been backward in pursuing at some considerable length in the past. Secondly, it is unnecessary because there is really no prima facie reason to suppose that there is any serious problems with the management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part of the atmosphere which underlies this motion was unquestionably that generated by the extraordinary series of allegations about corruption and maladministration in my Department, most of which were made by a single individual, a great many of which were made in a great batch of allegations, some 77 of them in May last year, and all which have now been the subject of detailed investigation and endorsement of that investigation by the Australian National Audit Office.
       </para>
       <para>
        At most, very minor matters of administrative failure were revealed by those investigations and overwhelmingly the allegations, many of which have been quite extreme and had quite a lot of publicity, have been shown to be utterly without foundation. Similarly, the assumptions that are made in the terms of reference about leaking from the Department, security of information being a major concern, is something that I do not accept on the basis in which it is clearly implied in the text of this motion. The assumption is made that leaks of foreign affairs material which have occurred are all to be attributed to my Department. That is simply not an assumption which is reasonable from everything that all of us know about the way in which this particular place works.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, such leaks as have occurred have invariably been the subject of prompt investigation by all the appropriate procedures which are available for doing this sort of thing, particularly through the Australian Federal Police. The fact that such investigations have, for the most part, proved fruitless is no demonstration of managerial incapacity or system incapacity or breakdown so far as the Department is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Equally, so far as the question of departmental morale is concerned and link- age of this with, impliedly, management shortfalls and arguments about overseas terms and conditions, I think again there is no ground that springs out at one, if one has any knowledge of the Department, to suggest that a full-scale inquiry of the kind that here is contemplated is justified. The staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has really demonstrated over and over again a quite extraordinary commitment, particularly in the context of crises of various kinds that erupt from time to time, and in particular I record again the indebtedness we should all feel towards the Department for the role that it played during the Gulf war and the lead-up to it, not only in the policy end of matters back here but also, of course, in the consular administration that was involved, and also the extraordinary courage and dedication to duty that was shown by those who stayed at their posts throughout this particular period.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is also worth saying briefly that, in terms of management generally, we are implementing a comprehensive management improvement program which does seek to improve productivity and morale through improving management and management skills at all levels. We have got in place a massive program of technological change to modernise the workplace. We have got in place a major program of formal educational, new opportunity and multi-skilling, which has opened up many opportunities for staff in the Department to advance themselves within the system, with in fact some 200 people in the Department now under- going tertiary study part time as a means of securing advancement and wider opportunities for themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could go on in much more detail about various matters that are the subject of this particular motion, but I think I have said enough to demonstrate that, really, if a reference of this kind is going to be made, it ought to be on firmer foundations than appear to be evident in this case. I said that the reference was not only unnecessary but regrettable, and I make that further point again for a couple of reasons. It is regrettable because any inquiry of this kind necessarily involves a major allocation and diversion of resources which simply, in the present environment, my Department can ill afford.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like every other department in the system, with the budgetary pressures that have been on us for years on end-Senator Reid, as a representative of constituents in this Territory, will be well aware of this-resources are being stretched thinner and thinner. Nerves are getting more and more frayed in more and more departments around the Government because of that fact. People are willing to shoulder the burdens and responsibilities of getting on with the job and the business of government. In my Department, they are willing, as I have said, to shoulder and burden responsibilities of particular demanding situations that occur necessarily from time to time. But it is a matter of regret that they are asked to shoulder and burden additional responsibilities to prepare massive amounts of paperwork and defences of actions that have been taken in the past in order to satisfy exercises of the kind that will be set in train by this particular motion. They are willing obviously to do that in the context of Senate Estimates committee hearings. That is the normal forum and vehicle for this kind of inquiry. They are willing to do it, of course, in the context of Audit Office investigations and inquiries; that is again part of the system. But this kind of ad hoc add-on really is a quite unhelpful further addition to an already desperately overburdened work force that is doing its best to manage in difficult circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say finally that it is regrettable because, by giving the opportunity, as this inquiry no doubt will, for the further airing of a whole variety of antagonisms towards the Department that are notori-ously held by at least some people, that will not do much to help the morale of a department which has been subject to quite a battering from assaults of this kind over the course of the last year. If the purported rationale for the motion is, among other things, concern about the morale of the Department, as appears to be the case from the drafting of the revised terms of reference, then I simply say finally that Senator Hill, by this particular bit of grandstanding, which the Australian Democrats have regrettably agreed to join, is not doing much to help just that.

         —The Australian Democrats believe that if an inquiry into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is warranted, and we do accept that there is some evidence to support the Opposition's case, then inquiries into other Commonwealth departments are also just as warranted, and possibly more so. To that end, two of my colleagues moved this morning that the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Employment, Education and Training also be the subject of inquiries into managerial performance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Department of Transport and Communications, for example, has distinguished itself by repeated failure to implement policy. The regional FM radio plan of 1987 has never been implemented. The Seven Network has been in breach of audience reach restrictions since April 1988 and was in breach of cross-media ownership rules for two years, and there are many other examples. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has been extensively criticised on student financial assistance, and that is just one area of considerable concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, while it has generally achieved a great deal with too few resources, has undergone significant upheavals and controversies in recent times, including industrial disputes, leaks and complaints about overseas conditions of service, and morale is said to be low, as it is in many departments. Some of these matters have, in our opinion, already been dealt with and, if that is true, then the Department will have an opportunity to demonstrate that publicly. If there are remaining problems, though, then this inquiry may be the catalyst for resolving them.

I indicate that, when I have finished my remarks, I will seek leave to continue my remarks later and will then move that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour today. I am not suggesting that the decision be put off indefinitely; I just want to indicate that there was no consultation whatsoever with me as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration to which it is now proposed that this reference be given.

        There used to be a courtesy in this place that a check was made with the committee chair and members of the committee as to whether or not the workload of the committee was in such a state that it was appropriate to take such a reference. I believe that such discussion should take place for that question of workload but also for the appropriateness of referring such a matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Democrats have indicated, they not only want to agree to Senator Hill's change of mind about which committee this should go to by sending a reference about the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, but also they want to give us a full-scale inquiry into two other departments, the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Employment, Education and Training.
       </para>
       <para>
        In each of these three cases, there is an appropriate committee of the Senate to deal with these matters, if it is decided that a committee should deal with them. We have previously passed a resolution of this Senate allocating departments amongst the eight standing committees. The Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has three departments allocated to it-the Department of Finance, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of the Treasury. There is one department relevant to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training; that is, the department of the same name. There are two departments appropriate to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which would be the appropriate committee for any inquiry into the Department of Transport and Communications.
       </para>
       <para>
        My point is that if there is to be such an inquiry-and I would support Senator Evans's argument against there being an inquiry at all-it ought to be undertaken by the appropriate committee. That committee ought to be developing relations with the department and the agencies relevant to the portfolio. We should not be loading Finance and Public Administration with an inquiry into potentially every department of the Government.

         —Thank you, Senator: I can do without such tributes! I heard Senator Hill's argument that, because there was a question of management systems, staff performance and accountability among the proposed terms of reference, it was relevant to Finance and Public Administration. Certainly, Finance and Public Administration has taken a Service-wide interest in things such as the Senior Executive Service and one or two other issues, but it is a bit much to add this load onto us. Obviously it will not be just the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: three departments are being talked about. I assume that the Opposition, in exchange for the support of the Democrats on this measure, will support the other two when they come up tomorrow. It may not be too strong to say that it is an insult to the relevant committees to suggest that they are not the appropriate ones to deal with these matters. They are the ones who ought to be developing relations with departments and agencies in their portfolios. It is nonsense to add this inquiry to the committee that I happen to chair.

        My initial suggestion to defer the matter at least until later in the day was to allow the necessary consultations to take place.

This has also happened with the reference of Bills to committees. As I indicated earlier, I think this matter should be dealt with later in the day. Therefore I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —The Student Assistance Amendment Bill is, in itself, not a particularly contentious Bill but one which reminds us of the major flaws that have appeared in the Government's administration of the Austudy scheme and its student support policies. The Bill deals with only some particular aspects of Austudy. It offers no overall review or reform of the scheme. Yet that is what Austudy is crying out for. It is what the Opposition has promised and has called for whenever we have discussed student assistance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill does not address the major problems of Austudy. It does not address the maladministration of it under this Government and it does not address its failure to have clear objectives by which the Government, and indeed the Parliament, can measure the success or otherwise of the scheme. I refer to the recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Student Financial Assistance. At page 21 of the report the Committee states:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is unacceptable however that apart from a few isolated surveys no real attempt has been made by DEET to establish if the program is meeting its stated aims.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was a conclusion reached by Government and Opposition members alike in the House of Representatives committee. On page 22 we read:
       </para>
       <para>
        No real assessment of the effectiveness of Austudy or alternative means of student assistance can be determined without proper performance indicators. These do not exist. In the absence of detailed data the Committee has been asked to accept DEET's subjective assessments of the program's effectiveness. It is difficult to accept that the Parliament is required to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars each year-
       </para>
       <para>
        in fact, over $1 billion this financial year-
       </para>
       <para>
        to a program for which few objective measures of effectiveness are available.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the most recent two-party review of the scheme: it is inadequately administered by the present Government. This Bill does not do anything to redress these inadequacies or to address those matters that were referred to by that parliamentary committee of review. The words that I have quoted are quite an indictment. It is no wonder that the Committee then proceeded to recommend bluntly that `the Government develop clear policy objectives for student financial assistance'. That is what the Opposition has promised since before the last election. That is what is needed and that is not what is involved in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have stated the Opposition's, and indeed this Parliament's, central concern about Austudy. The Government has proceeded to run the scheme in a policy vacuum. It is no wonder that there are so many accounts of inefficient or inadequate administration, a widespread feeling in the student community that Austudy is not being targeted satisfactorily, and grounds for doubt that this substantial slab of taxpayers' money is being spent wisely. This Bill does nothing to assuage our fears and concerns about Austudy.
       </para>
       <para>
        What this very limited Bill does do however is, on the whole, quite reasonable. It is of small compass. What it sets out to do is reasonable and the Opposition supports the particular small measures of improvement contained in it. I refer to the first. There is a new provision requiring the use of tax file numbers as a condition for receipt of Austudy and Abstudy. I say to honourable senators in the chamber that whenever the use of a tax file number is being extended the Opposition looks at that very carefully.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have approached this question with due scepticism, concern and caution. Indeed, we will listen to what other senators have to say in this debate about the use of the tax file number. On the basis of our examination, I can say on behalf of the Opposition that, up to this point, we do not object to this extension of the tax file number to Austudy. So we do not oppose this proposal. We will remain alert to any intrusion by government on the privacy of individuals or to any undue bureaucratic extensions of tax into other areas of government administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill proposes changes to the late payment of penalties. It also proposes changes to the time within which the Student Assistance Review Tribunal gives reasons for its decisions. The Opposition welcomes these positive changes. The Bill seeks to remove references in the Act to Australian postgraduate awards. This is sensible. It also provides for protection in respect of student Austudy files subpoenaed by courts and tribunals. This change is also supported by the Opposition. We are particularly concerned that details about students be handled with great accountability by education institutions and by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        On a number of occasions over recent years I have alerted the Government to the loopholes in this area and to the discipline of the Department of Employment, Education and Training in particular in terms of the handling of student information. Fortunately, through Estimates committees and in other ways, the Government has responded to Opposition urgings on this matter. I believe that this area is now in a reasonably satisfactory state.
       </para>
       <para>
        I particularly welcome clause 4 of the Bill, which is the Government's response to an earlier report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. That Committee had expressed concern that ministerial determinations under the Act are not subject to parliamentary review. The Bill provides that those determinations will have to be tabled in Parliament and be subject to disallowance by Parliament. I welcome this move by the Government, as I always welcome increases in accountability by the Executive to the legislature. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has again shown the value of its examination of Bills. I commend the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to comment on something which was in the Bill that was dealt with in the other place but which is not in the Bill now. I refer to a reduction in government accountability to Parliament by abolishing the special annual report on the operation of the Student Assistance Act. The Government intended not to give a special report but to include such matters in the annual report. My colleague in the House of Representatives Dr Kemp, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, objected to this. The Government, very wisely, took this matter up right from the start and the status quo will remain. Had the Government not acted in this way, I am very confident that an amendment would have been moved in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, the Government had wanted to absorb the special report into the annual report of the Department and the Opposition's resistance to this has been effective. I might say, though, that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, rather grudgingly accepted the amendment that the Opposition moved in the other place. But accept it he did, and we are pleased about that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's approach to Austudy has been made clear on repeated occasions. We have deplored the present inefficiency and ineffectiveness of Austudy. There is no public confidence in Austudy. This scheme, which attracts $1 billion of government spending, is not sufficiently targeted. As I have said, the Government has not even determined what the criteria ought to be to judge the effectiveness of Austudy. The Government is not able to establish any professional accountability. It is not able to say whether targets are being met because there are no targets.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been calling for a thorough review of the rules of administration of the scheme to ensure that they are fair to all and that the scheme runs smoothly for all Australians. We do not wish to see anyone deprived of the opportunity to undertake education due to financial pressures. Australia needs a student assistance program that will effectively accomplish this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has quietly acknowledged the strength of our calls for a review of Austudy and its present weaknesses by arranging for consultants to carry out a review of student assistance. The Government seems to have been trying not to draw much attention to this recent decision to arrange a consultancy. Although tenders were called in April, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services made no public announcement about it until 30 May, just a few days ago. Why such reticence? Even the Minister had to concede in his press release:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . there are some issues to do with the targeting of Austudy that need to be looked at a bit more closely.
       </para>
       <para>
        Well done, Minister! As I say, there has been a guarded, reticent, much after the event acknowledgment by the Minister that the Opposition is right. The Government is saying, `Yes, we too will join in'. It is trying to save the bacon by doing what the Opposition has been advocating for some years. In that recent statement, the Minister also said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not saying that Austudy as it stands is ideal. We need to explore these issues more closely.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consultants are due to report to the Government by the end of December and we will look forward to that report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to give me an assurance at the end of the debate that that report, which is due at the end of September, be made public, or at least that it be made available to me, to Dr Kemp in the other place and to others with an interest in education and Austudy matters. This is not something that should be kept quiet and treated as a document for the Government's own use. It should not be subject to inaction. If this review is to be of any substance, the report should be made available to those in this Parliament who are interested. It should not be buried in the bureaucracy. The Government should allow it to be exposed to full public and parliamentary debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to refer to two matters that were raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I have already commended the Committee for the report that it made on this Bill. First, an amendment has been proposed to clause 14. The proposed new subsection would enable the Minister, or a prescribed officer, to determine whether to waive the payment of a late payment charge or interest on overpaid amounts. The Committee believes that such decisions appear to be immune from review. The Minister, in his reply to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, said, in effect, that the non-reviewability in that section was a continuation of what was previously in the Act and that he did not desire a change. He did quote from his predecessor's letter to that Committee when the same matter was raised in December 1989. At that time, the Government promised to do a number of things to improve review processes. But we find now, 18 months later, that nothing has eventuated. The present Minister now writes rather plaintively:
       </para>
       <para>
        I should perhaps add that the Government remains committed to introducing external appeals for the ABSTUDY scheme, although the details are still to be finalised. The Government has not introduced legislation relating to the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme as the Scheme is currently under review. Unfortunately, the Ministerial guidelines have not yet been prepared as my Department's debt processing procedures are still being established . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Three delays; three lame excuses. I conclude the quote:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have directed that guidelines be finalised as a matter of priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where are these things that are a matter of priority? I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give some indication on those three points. I certainly hope that the Minister will now get a move on and see that these matters are attended to.
       </para>

        A second matter raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is the lack of easy readability of the Act. Yet it is an Act that brings benefits to thousands of Australians. It is one of those areas of legislation that are of very real importance to many individual students and their families and others involved in education. The Committee's report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee notes by way of a general comment that the legislation of which this amendment is to form a part is almost impossible to follow. The Student Assistance Act 1973 was re-numbered and re-lettered (with effect from 2 January 1990) as a result of section 17 of the Student Assistance Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989. The Act has not been reprinted to take account of the re-numbering. Since the latest reprint of the Act was published in 1986, in order to find the relevant section referred to by this amending bill, it is necessary to take the 1986 reprint and manually-
       </para>
       <para>
        with one's own pencil-
       </para>
       <para>
        re-number it, taking into account the several other amendments that have been enacted to date . . . individuals have a right-
       </para>
       <para>
        the Scrutiny of Bills Committee contends, I contend, and the Opposition contends-
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . to understand-
       </para>
       <para>
        and-
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . to be able to work out what the law is . . . if the law is hard to understand (as it is here), it does nothing to assist the general public in knowing what the law is. The Committee, therefore, suggests that the reprinting of the Student Assistance Act 1973 be undertaken as a matter of urgency.
       </para>
       <para>
        That completes the quote from this-again-all-party, Scrutiny of Bills parliamentary Committee. This was an important plea from the Committee and people who are affected by the legislation we pass should be able to make sense of it without undue difficulty. That is why I emphasise this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has replied to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, acknowledging the validity of its concern. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have written to my colleague, the Attorney-General, to ask that a reprint be arranged as soon as possible after the present Bill is finalised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary: is there a deadline for this, and is this in train? What assurance, further to the one which I have just quoted-and that is welcome-can be given in this debate? I certainly hope that the Government will act speedily to implement it, but I cannot help wondering whether the assurance would ever have been given if the Minister had not been prodded by the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I remind the Senate of a very important part of the Austudy debate: that is, the particular hardship suffered by families caught up in the rural crisis. On 13 May we had four or five hours of debate in this chamber on the particular effect of Austudy on the student members of families caught up with hardships in the rural crisis, particularly as it relates to the assets test-that is, we understand that there is an income test to get Austudy, but that if a family has about $700,000-worth of assets in addition to the family home, they are denied any access to Austudy benefits on the ground that they have a substantial asset. But, as we know, in the rural crisis incomes of many families are zero or negative and yet they may have a primary production asset that is greater than that-nearly three-quarters of a million dollars. The valuations administered with regard to Austudy are out of date and the value of properties has fallen off to below that cutoff point. In the meantime, the students are suffering.
       </para>
       <para>
        To cut a long story short, I moved a motion on behalf of the Opposition in the Senate-with great commitment, and it was supported by not only Opposition senators but Democrat senators-and it went through on the voices. Even Government senators understood the rural crisis. On that day, 13 May-some six weeks ago-we passed the motion that I moved. It reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        That the Senate calls on the Government to immediately-
       </para>
       <para>
        immediately-
       </para>
       <para>
        introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from Austudy by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        That motion has been on the books, adopted by this chamber, for six weeks. What have we heard from the Government? What immediate action have we seen from the Government? I do not think the Government would want to treat this chamber with contempt. I do not think the Government would want to have a series of tactical, procedural legislative difficulties in this chamber when it has not directly responded to a clear resolution of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the kind of hardship provisions that I had in mind. I refer to my speech of 13 May, reported at page 3208 of Hansard. I shall not quote all of the words that appear there, but, on behalf of the Opposition, I suggested to the Government that administratively there be a change in the approach of the Valuer General to the valuation of rural properties, to make sure that they were up to date and not overvalued with expensive and time-consuming delays by appeal. That is one thing that can be done immediately. Another was to bring in hardship provisions parallel to those that have already been announced by this Government with regard to social security benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the Government that these measures are to hand. The Opposition and the Democrats are not in the position of having all of the information available to government and have not the legislative or other administrative machinery to define exactly what will meet that general criteria. So there is a general area for the Government to act in. There are specific references that I set out six weeks ago, which appear on page 3208 of the Senate Hansard.
       </para>
       <para>
        I did not move that motion merely to express an opinion; I moved it as a call to the Government to take action and to do so urgently. The word in the motion-as I emphasised when I read it just now-is `immediately'. So far the Government has made no response to that motion passed by the Senate. I regard that as a disgrace. If it is not remedied in the next couple of days, it will remain an insult and contempt to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also an insult to the rural community, who are suffering so much. The financial pressures on rural Australia have not eased since 13 May; quite the contrary. Yet the Government has been unmoving so far and it offers no response. It has offered no hope of relief. It has offered no hardship provision for those families with members of the family enrolled in education courses-not just higher education courses, but in schools; Austudy reaches to secondary students.
       </para>
       <para>
        In these circumstances, the Opposition again urges the Government to act and immediately to introduce hardship provisions so that those being hurt by the present operation of the assets test can be granted relief. I am not confident that the Government will act on the merit of the argument, even on these quite persuasive words, without some further pressure from the Senate. Therefore, after careful consideration, on behalf of the Opposition I propose that the Senate refuse to approve the Bill until the Government makes the response called for by the Senate motion of 13 May. Accordingly, I move this amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time:
       </para>
       <para>
        Omit all words after ``That'', substitute ``consideration of the bill be deferred until the Government reports to the Senate on the action it proposes to take in response to the Senate's resolution of 13 May concerning hardship provisions for those affected by the assets test on Austudy''.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of all the current problems that Austudy has, the effect of the assets test on rural families suffering hardship is the single most urgent problem. The Senate has decided that already and the Government should accept that decision. As soon as the Government gives its response, the Opposition will give its support to the passage of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. If the Government responds by Friday, it will be a matter of minutes, as the final stages of the Bill can be completed and the Bill can head for the statute book. The Opposition does not have any substantial amendment to the Bill, although it will listen to continuing debate on it in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by making it quite clear to Senator McMullan, the Deputy Whip and the advisers on their left that we seek to defer consideration of the Bill until the Government responds. We do not want to give any particular test to the Government's response; we want a genuine and substantial response. We want the Government to come back to the Senate and report directly on the terms set out in the motion that the Opposition has moved and which the Senate has adopted. As soon as that is done, as soon as we get a substantial, genuine response, we will proceed and, of course, move to adopt the Bill. It is in the Government's hands to make that response and I urge that the response come later this week.

         —I agree with Senator Teague, who said at the outset of his address that the Student Assistance Amendment Bill tackles Austudy and refines the administration of the scheme. He described, in the first instance, some six or seven amendments which were agreeable to the Opposition; in fact, the Australian Democrats also welcome those initial half a dozen amendments.

       <para>
        We are not impressed at all with the extension of the tax file number and its usage in the way that the Bill proposes. We see a concentration on the bureaucracy of the scheme to the blissful disregard of the sorts of criticisms that are being made by students and also criticisms that have been made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which recently reviewed student financial assistance. It seems that many of those criticisms are totally disregarded in favour of a concentration on the bureaucratic nature of student assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have before us the latest proposal regarding the extended use of the so-called tax file number. There is no doubt that the tax file number scheme, with its slow and methodical extension, has become a de facto Australia Card. This small Bill-it is, in fact, an omnibus Bill-hides within it yet another extension and invasion of privacy. The Bills Digest for this legislation dated 14 March 1991 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The requirement to produce a tax file number has been compared by a number of commentators to an `Australia Card by stealth'. The Australia Card proposal would have effected many of the areas that the tax file number now has been extended to . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        According to some commentators, including Dr Roger Clarke from the Australian National University who makes the point at page 17 of his September 1990 report, The Expansionary History of the Enhanced Tax File Number Scheme, the tax file number system has been arguably extended to undertake even more than the original Australia Card tasks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, has stated that the use of the term `tax file number' is now a misnomer. The Commissioner has stated that the extension of the tax file number raised `significant privacy concerns' while its use to increase data matching has `infringed basic privacy principles'. He made those comments as long ago as 23 August and 24 August 1990 and they were reported in the Age newspaper.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the current Bill, the requirement to produce a tax file number is contained in proposed new section 44a-that is, clause 17-which would be inserted in the principal Act. Clause 17 would require students to provide their tax file number as a precondition for payment of student income support. The tax file number of a student's parents and the tax file number of a student's spouse, if relevant, would also be required where their incomes or assets were taken into account when calculating payment. The fact is that in the vast majority of cases the income of the parents and spouse are taken into account.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 22, which amends the regulation-making power under the Act, should also be noted. In the reviewed version of the Bill, clause 22 has been amended to broaden the power of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to require information, including the tax file numbers of students and other persons. It is at least pleasing to see that the Government amendment, which embraces the tax file number, acknowledges the concern expressed by the Privacy Commissioner about the Department's authority in this area. Nevertheless, the Australian Democrats will oppose clause 17 of the amending Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the coalition has supported the Government's extended use of tax file numbers, the Democrats will continue to voice their concerns and objections about this de facto Australia Card. According to the December 1990 report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled The Proposed Tax File Number Provisions and Data Matching Program, provisions extending the use of the tax file number `should only proceed for the most compelling of reasons'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even the Privacy Commissioner, in his October 1990 report entitled Data-Matching in Commonwealth Administration: Discussion Paper and Draft Guidelines, recommended `the provision of a clear statement of the justification, costs, benefits and safeguards for programs' to help protect privacy. We do not see that here; we do not see a clear statement of the justification of costs, benefits and safeguards.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to clause 17, there is clearly a lack of evidence and argument to support the requirement for provision of not only the student's tax file number, but also that of his or her parents and partner.  That provision would actually require many students to apply for a tax file number which they had not had before and that raises even greater concerns about the Government's intentions here. The Australian people are entitled to a clear and compelling case for any proposed extension of the tax file number system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The use of the tax file number is increasing incrementally and significantly, in many cases in a way which is subverting the way we carry on our daily affairs. It is true that, in purely practical terms, the increasing use of the tax file number perversely supports its continued expansion. Given that the system is already in place, it is difficult to deny the cost savings that will be brought about by its extension rather than the use of some other method. It is becoming all too easy. Because it exists and because the system works, it is easier to extend it than to think up a more equitable way of ensuring that departments operate efficiently or that they disburse their funds efficiently. It is being extended because it is just so easy to extend it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In facilitating links across different areas, there is increased transgression of privacy and greater potential for abuse. The Democrats believe that it is necessary to stop the proliferation of people who can use tax file numbers and gain access to them. The Australian community has many valid concerns about the dangers of a national identification system, including the increasing scope for misuse of personal information. The community has also witnessed the Government's broken promises; the use of this tax file number is yet another one to add to the litany of broken promises.
       </para>
       <para>
        In September 1987, the Federal Government withdrew its Australia Card proposal in the face of overwhelming public disapproval. Instead of introducing the national identification system, the Government announced its intention to enhance the tax file number scheme. At that time, the Australian public was assured that this was not a multi-purpose register. Explicitly and repeatedly we were told that the tax file number would be used exclusively by the Australian Taxation Office for taxation purposes only.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to Dr Clarke, a reader in information systems in the Australian National University's Department of Commerce, whom I have already quoted, the assurances and protections provided by the Government in 1998 have proved `worthless'. I agree with him. In his recent paper, Dr Clarke evaluates the Government's early assurances regarding the limited nature of the tax file number scheme. I seek leave to incorporate that section of his report which includes relevant quotations and responses, namely Exhibit 6 on pages 16 to 18 of the report.

         —In that material Dr Clarke states that the initial scope of the enhanced tax file number was wider than had been commonly understood, while additional uses had accumulated through `function creep', as he describes it. The tax file number scheme, instead of applying exclusively to taxation, now applies to any statute administratively moved under the Australian Taxation Office's control and any purposes deemed-we like that word deemed; it is appearing in a lot of places these days-by statute to be taxation law.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The main areas to which the scheme has been widened so far include the administration of virtually every benefit and pension paid by any Commonwealth Government agency, such as unemployment and sickness benefits, the sole parent's pension, family allowance, and family allowance supplement-it is continuing. It also applies to the location of defaulters and the matching of personal data from all major client-oriented agencies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The requirement to furnish a tax file number has also been extended to new programs including the training guarantees scheme and the higher education contribution scheme where tertiary fees are paid through the tax system. Students who cannot afford to pay up front are also penalised by having to pay 15 per cent more. It should also be noted that several data matching programs are already conducted in the Department of Employment, Education and Training as well as by other departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Alert Digest No. 5, 26 March 1991, the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills raises serious concerns about clause 17. The Committee states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . while such provisions may be seen as necessary to prevent persons defrauding the student assistance system, they may also be considered as unduly intrusive upon a person's privacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Scrutiny Committee states that clause 17:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1(a)(i) of the Committee's terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        These and other problems raised by the Scrutiny Committee have not been answered or properly addressed by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin. In its eighth report of 29 May 1991, the Scrutiny Committee reproduces and discusses the Minister's response to these and other concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to clause 17 and the privacy issues involved, the Minister raises two points. First, he states:
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been careful to ensure that the legislation does not go beyond the periodic checks to prevent abuses of the assistance and taxation systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that point, I ask all honourable senators to consider what difference it makes whether one's privacy is abused periodically, regularly or occasionally. If it has been abused, it has been abused. This response by the Minister that the checks would be periodic is simply no help at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the Minister responds by actually misrepresenting the position taken by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Minister states that the majority of the members of that Committee in its December 1990 report entitled Proposed tax file number provisions and data-matching program `concluded that use of the tax file numbers in the data-matching is appropriate'. The reference given is paragraph 21 on page 9 of that report. But that paragraph states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee is aware of much debate concerning the proposed extension of use of the tax file number and feels that any extensions should only proceed for the most compelling of reasons. The Committee is not insensitive to privacy concerns but the majority view is that the present circumstances are such as to warrant the tax file number's use.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that the Minister's interpretation was vastly different and that he quoted selectively to suit his needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Scrutiny of Bills Committee observes, this paragraph clearly states that any extensions of the tax file number should proceed only for the most compelling of reasons. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee's eighth report also states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the Committee notes that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee stated that the majority view was that the use of the tax file number was warranted in `the present circumstances', that is, in the circumstances that applied in respect of the Bill that the Committee was then considering.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee did not say that extension of its use was warranted in the circumstances of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs also comments on the fact that the Privacy Commissioner would not discuss the merits of the proposed legislation as it affects our privacy. On page 8 the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . some members of the Committee felt that the statutory provisions which govern the office of Privacy Commissioner unduly limited his independence.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is most regrettable that there should be these statutory limitations on the role and advice that the Privacy Commissioner can give. These provisions appear mainly in Part IV of the 1988 Privacy Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other problems which were raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee have also remained unanswered. For instance, the Committee notes that, in relation to overpayment, there is no provision for review of decisions about whether or not to waiver the payment of a late payment charge or interest. The Minister's reply does not rectify this problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister's answer here is familiar, and I am sure that Senator Baume has also heard this one before as he seems to have heard some of the other answers. The answer is that guidelines relating to recovery of overpayments will be introduced. It appears that we must rely on appropriate guidelines. Yet these could easily be framed in favour of not waiving debts, while the matter of review remains a problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Scrutiny Committee also notes that the legislation of which this amendment is to form a part is almost impossible to follow and should be reprinted as a matter of urgency. The Student Assistance Act 1973 was re-numbered and re-lettered by a Bill passed at the end of 1989, the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989. The Committee observed:
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the last reprint of the Act was published in 1986, in order to find the relevant section referred to by this amending Bill, it is necessary to take the 1986 reprint and manually re-number it, taking into account the several other amendments that have been enacted to date.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unless one maintains a personal set of cut and paste Acts, the only people who know what is going on with the current proposals are the bureaucrats in the Department. This is totally unacceptable. It is obviously a self-serving arrangement to remove from the public area the knowledge of how to get around this business. The Minister's response here is that reprinting will be arranged after this Bill is finalised. That does not help.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a letter to the Department dated 13 May 1991, the Privacy Commissioner, Mr O'Connor, writes:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is regrettable that the information handling provisions are to be included in the Regulations rather than in the Act, although I accept that there is now no alternative given the limited time available.
       </para>
       <para>
        This comment is really quite disturbing. Of course, the Government's haste in pushing through this amendment is no excuse for failure to make crucial legislative provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his letter to the Department, the Commissioner also welcomes the undertaking to enable direct quotation by parents and spouses. He states that it is important for pamphlets and forms to clearly present this option. This is another example of the sort of thing which is necessary to make sure that people actually know what has been involved when they first tangle with the bureaucracy associated with these sorts of assistance areas.

        The Commissioner also suggests that the exemption categories should be extended to give discretion to exempt students from obtaining a parent's or spouse's tax file number in unforeseen and exceptional circumstances. We expect to see legislation cover all situations and contingencies but, of course, we see it not often enough. Here it is taken up as a suggestion by the Commissioner.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, the Commissioner believes that all clients, not just Abstudy clients, should be able to receive assistance pending the issue of a tax file number. The assumption here is that there is only a certain category of students which do not already have a tax file number and may have to apply for and receive a tax file number. Therefore, only a certain category of students will need assistance in the interim. That is a false assumption. I agree with the Commissioner that the possibility should be there for all clients to receive some sort of assistance in that pending period which can be an extensive period of time.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are after an increase in flexibility, that is, the flexibility to be able to meet the unforeseen circumstances which the bureaucrats cannot imagine and which exist in the real world. We want to see in legislation, through flexibility, the capacity to meet those situations. That is the sort of thing which will reduce the likelihood of hardship. That is the sort of thing that eventually requires the very sort of amendment which you, Mr Acting Deputy President, are so keen on seeing happen. Flexibility in the legislation reduces the need for other hardship provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I continue to quote Mr O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, because it just adds a little strength to that point:
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, if a client has applied for a tax file number direct to the ATO, rather than through DEET, this should be sufficient, as it is in the case of DSS and DVA benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a minimum it should be within the Department's power to commence assistance without quotation of a tax file number in extenuating circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the case with these other departments. Why should it be any different with DEET? Mr O'Connor continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        A client may suffer considerable financial strain, for example, if the application for a tax file number was lost by the ATO and the client was without financial assistance for an extended period.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that that situation could quite easily occur. Apart from the tax file number, the other main area in this Bill which gives cause for concern is the restructuring of the late payment charge and interest in relation to overpayment of a benefit-clauses 13 to 16. At present, a person who is notified of a debt but does not repay it within three months is liable for a late payment charge of $15 plus 10 per cent of the outstanding amount, up to a maximum of $515. Interest also accrues from the end of that period.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under clause 13, which amends section 40 of the principal Act, three months after the notification of the debt the debtor would be liable to a flat charge of $100, while the interest would accrue from the date of notice, not three months on. The interest provision represents an unambiguous worsening of the position of student assistance debtors. This fits with the declared intention to spur quicker repayments. There must be efficiency of those repayments. That seems to drive the desires of this Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        The late fee changes represent a worsening of the position of those debtors who owe less than $850. They are being harassed, harangued and hurried and it is a much worse situation. This suggests that most overpayments are of relatively small amounts. Otherwise why would there be this fascination with this section in the legislation? If it were not the case that most were small amounts, it would not be worth even drafting this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the small amount of research that has been undertaken and been available to me, only a tiny proportion of overpayments are due to deliberate fraud. The sorts of things that result in overpayment are the inability of people to estimate their spouses' projected income for the next year or the fact that they, or somebody else, have worked a little more overtime and were unable to estimate it at the time of application. These are the sorts of the things which are humanly impossible to estimate. Sometimes they result in an overpayment of $400 or $500, which is impossible to keep track of during the year. It may only be a few dollars each week, but at the end of the period to be asked to pay for that in toto is an imposition which causes a great deal of hardship to a number of small debtors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats believe that there should be some differentiation between overpayment due to the departmental error, applicant error and cases of deliberate fraud. It should not be beyond the talents of those who devised this to actually differentiate between these things, but that seems not to be the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        For instance, under clause 14, which amends section 41, the Minister or a prescribed officer may determine that interest or a late payment charge is not payable. It is suggested that the exercise of discretion to waiver or write off the late payment charge and interest should be limited, with more grace perhaps where the Department has made a mistake. As noted by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and referred to earlier, there is currently no provision for the review of these decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains various other proposals, including deletion of references to competitive postgraduate awards; provision that written decisions of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal are available within 10 working days; and provision that ministerial determinations under the Act be tabled and subject to disallowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats also support the Privacy Commissioner's advice in his recommended guidelines regarding the expansionary use of tax file numbers that data-matching programs should be subject to annual report by the Privacy Commissioner. The current Bill does not address the many problems and inequities of the Austudy scheme, as was made clear in the speech of the previous speaker from the coalition, Senator Teague. This Bill could have redressed a number of problems but it is concentrating on things which were not really a highlight of the review conducted by the committee from the House of Representatives. If we are going to review Austudy, we would prefer that greater priority be given to a number of other things.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last month, the coalition and the Government declined the opportunity to modify regulations which govern Austudy and which represent the worst anomalies and inequities under the Austudy scheme. Concern was expressed by Senator Teague and others during this debate. There was concern with the assets test. There was the opportunity a few weeks ago to redress that by accepting the Democrats position to remove that regulation in its entirety. Those changes would drastically have improved the scheme, but that opportunity has passed us by. We may have missed that chance, but we will continue to follow whichever means are available to us to attempt to improve this scheme, and its administration, for the benefit of the students that are supposed to be benefiting from it now but are not.
       </para>
       <para>
        This scheme has attracted widespread criticism and is currently the subject of a government appointed consultancy report. By definition, it is inadequate and must be addressed more widely than in this Bill. Many people who cannot afford to pay for their studies have been denied support and excluded from education because of the unfair operation of both the income and the assets tests. Rural students, in particular, as was mentioned by Senator Teague, are penalised because of their parents' assets, despite the fact that they are income-poor. We have had that opportunity and we have disregarded it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats will continue to take any opportunity to redress that situation. We are most entertained by the proposition put forward by the coalition; we will carefully consider it. If that is a way of redressing the problems with Austudy, then that may be the only way we can proceed. It may be the way that will force some sort of action on this.

It has therefore been arguably extended to rather more than the Australia Card tasks.

Senator Teague asked whether the consultant's report would be made available to him and other members of Parliament. Essentially, as Senator Teague knows, this is very much a matter for the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin. It is not possible for me to give a definite response at this stage. That is as much as I can say at the moment. Obviously Senator Teague's interest in this report will be conveyed to Mr Baldwin. I hope that he takes that into account when making an assessment as to whether to make it public or not.

        There is also some question as to the status of guidelines on late payment charges.

        The major point that was raised by Senator Hill goes to the tax file number and in that respect he quoted correspondence from the Privacy Commissioner, Kevin O'Connor, and correspondence to the Department on this Bill. The Government respects the views of the Privacy Commissioner and takes them into account. To that extent, there has been a consultative process with him on this particular piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government considers that there is a need to apply the tax file number here. That need was expressed some months ago in the second reading debate on the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990. It was probably towards the end of last year that we made it clear that, as a Government, we would move to apply the tax file number to these payments that are the subject of this legislation. The essential reason behind that is that, because of the application of the tax file number in this area, savings arising from student assistance participation in data-matching will be in the vicinity of $7m a year. That was the prime consideration of the Government in applying the tax file number in this particular area.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are concerned that there would be increased debt if payments were made before clients submitted their tax file numbers. As a consequence, the range of exceptions to prepayment before registration of the tax file number is limited in the Bill before the Parliament. The exception of course has been included for Ab-study students because of the special needs of this group. This aspect of the scheme will be kept under review. As Senator Bell rightly said, the Privacy Commissioner does have a particular concern about making such an option available to other clients and the need for some flexibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consultations have been undertaken with the Privacy Commissioner. As the Senate should know, as part of those consultations the Bill does provide that regulations may specify additional classes of exemptions. Pursuant to those provisions in the legislation, it is proposed that regulations be made to cover the following categories: parents or spouses who are temporarily overseas, as well as the ones who are permanently overseas, as is specifically provided in the legislation; parents or spouses estranged from the student; parents or spouses who have died; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who live in remote localities; and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are required to attend traditional ceremonies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am told, and in fact the correspondence has indicated, that the Privacy Commissioner does endorse this level of exemption, although it can be acknowledged that he does want more. As I have said, the Government's response is that we feel that the financial return is something that should not be jeopardised.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will refer to a couple of points that Senator Teague raised in pursuing his amendment during the second reading debate to defer consideration of this legislation. I can give two assurances to Senator Teague. I anticipate that he would be satisfied by them. In turn, given the role that Senator Bell has taken these days of supporting the Opposition as often as he can, I anticipate that he may also feel inclined to review his position on this matter.

In terms of the hardship provisions that Senator Teague raised, in response to the motion that was passed in the Senate on 13 May calling on the Government to develop hardship provisions, I can say that a proposal has been developed to provide Austudy to all students whose parents or spouse are in receipt of a Department of Social Security (DSS) pension or benefit or the relocation adjustment scheme provided under part C of that scheme. A proposal has been developed and, if circumstances permit, the proposal may be progressed either before or during the Budget session.

        Senator Teague also raised, in response to the motivation for his deferral motion, the question of the valuation of assets. Valuations will be undertaken from 1 January 1992 and can be reviewed at any date on the basis of a request by students. I can give an assurance that valuations will be up to date. Payment of allowances will be backdated if it is found that asset values have fallen. Guidelines to this effect are currently being prepared and will be circulated and made publicly available. On these two points I hope I have satisfied Senator Teague's interest and his motivation for moving a deferral motion. I do not think I should say much more at this stage.

         —by leave-I welcome the three specific answers that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) gave to my three specific questions in the body of my speech. I also welcome the two broad but quite detailed assurances that the Minister has given in response to my calling for assurances on two aspects of the motion that the Senate adopted on 13 May.

       <para>
        First, I welcome the assurance that valuation, as it applies to the assets test, will be in up to date values and that the assets test will not deny, from a point during the year, the availability of Austudy when a valuation has changed to allow that to happen. Secondly, I note the Minister's reference to hardship provisions directly in response to the Senate resolution of 13 May. Where parents or spouses are receiving the Department of Social Security benefit under the hardship provisions that have been brought in under that Act, and under parallel hardship provisions in regard to other areas, such persons, and their dependants, will be able to gain Austudy provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I query whether that is lawful given the state of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. I do not deny that the Government can give that assurance now. It is the assurance that I have been asking for. In the light of that, I regard this as a significant day for the Senate in its role in debating legislation in that the Opposition did bring some pressure upon the Government to come up with those assurances before this Bill could proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the Minister and I thank the Government for giving me, with sufficient substance, the assurances that the Opposition seeks. As a result of the debate today and the earlier debate six weeks ago in the Senate, I believe that rural families who otherwise would not have been assisted will be directly assisted by Austudy. We will be able to monitor that during the Budget session. I wish every speed to the measures that the Government has announced. I seek leave to withdraw the second reading amendment that I moved earlier.

         —The Australian Democrats oppose clause 17 of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. An amendment has been circulated in my name. The Australian Democrats and the Australian community reject the continued extension of the tax file number system. The Government has broken repeated assurances about the use of the tax file number and its extension. Australian citizens are rightfully angry and disturbed about the growing demands in public and private sectors for the disclosure of personal information.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In 1988 the Government guaranteed that the tax file numbering system was completely voluntary. However, the cost of staying outside it is no longer just a payment in advance at top marginal rates of taxation. As I noted in the second reading debate when I quoted Dr Clarke, the cost to those who attempt to stay outside the provision of tax file numbers is also the complete exclusion from all forms of Government benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many valid concerns about the dangers of this system also applied to the previous proposal for an Australia Card. These concerns include the serious erosion of privacy and the increasing scope for misuse of personal information, including action taken on the basis of inaccurate material or incorrect analysis. The Australia Card proposal was opposed by the Australian Democrats. We will be continuing to strenuously oppose and reject the imposition of a national identification system under another name. We see the insidious creep which is facilitated by clause 17 and for that reason we oppose it.

         —The Opposition has given careful consideration to Senator Bell's speech on this matter in the second reading debate and to his remarks made during the committee stage, but it will support the Government in this matter. I make it quite clear that, as I said in my second reading speech, the Opposition will continue to look most carefully and cautiously at any use of the tax file number beyond its immediate use in the Australian Taxation Office. Although Australian citizens are not compulsorily required to register their tax file number with their bank accounts by the end of this month, if they do not do so the Tax Office will be able to deduct tax at the top income tax rate. It will be sorted out eventually in the tax return of any individual. So a great majority of Australians, wherever they have moneys deposited, will be giving their tax file number to banks all over the country in these weeks.

        Secondly, with regard to social security benefits, unemployment benefits, there are requirements for the giving of tax file numbers. The position is similar with regard to student benefits. However, a person's tax file number is still a private matter that is not to be disclosed in an unauthorised way. Because taxpayers' money to the tune of $1 billion is concerned, the Opposition sees that this is an appropriate use of the tax file number consistent with its other uses.

As I recall from an answer to a previous question I asked of the Minister that we are talking about a scheme which pays out something of the order of $820m and costs something of the order of $30m to administer. Is the saving of $7m in outlays a saving in payments made to some people or a saving in administration costs? If that is a $7m saving in administration costs, it would then seem to me to be most appropriately directed to payments to students.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Opposition is not opposed to the proposed amendments to either Act. However, we have some amendments in relation to both pieces of legislation to be amended by the Bill before us. I do not, in fact, propose to say very much about either of the Acts that are being amended. The Bill before us seeks to amend quite extensively the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. That is the Act which introduced what is known as Comcare which was brought into operation in 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of the amendments proposed by the Government are designed to remove some restrictive and inflexible provisions to make Comcare work more effectively. The Opposition has no criticism to offer of any of these amendments which, as I said, are designed to make Comcare, in light of the experience of the last few years, a better operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's amendments relate only to the question of discrimination on age grounds; namely the provisions which refer to people being unable to serve on the Commission once they reach the age of 65. Also, there is a definition of employee that is restricted to those people who have not reached the age of 65; that is, no doubt, as a result of similar restrictions on Commonwealth employment which we think should be removed. The amendments that we will seek to move are on a very important matter, but are not detailed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation proposes amendments to the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973. The Government in this legislation has proposed quite a significant change in the eligibility for membership of the Tribunal in relation to a group of people who would obviously have conflicts of interest if they were able to serve on the Tribunal immediately. Those are officers of the Public Service, holders of public offices, holders of judicial office and members of the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing provision of the Remuneration Tribunals Act prohibits the appointment of anybody who has served in any of those offices during the immediately preceding period of seven years. The Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction extends to the determination of salaries for these people, although its powers now, in relation to members of parliament, have been somewhat restricted as a result of legislation passed about a year ago. Nevertheless, the Tribunal's jurisdiction does give extensive powers in relation to various aspects of the remuneration of members of parliament other than salary.
       </para>
       <para>
        Judges and members of parliament receive pensions which are related to their salaries. The holders of public office or those in public service may well have attitudes of mind which still prevail after they have ceased to serve.
       </para>
       <para>
        There seems to be good sense in the provisions which put a substantial space of time, namely seven years, between the service of these officers and their subsequent appointment to a position which determines such important conditions of service. As I said, in the case of judges, there is also a direct relationship between the salary received by those holding the office and the pension received by those who have retired. That is not as direct a relationship as it used to be in relation to members of parliament as the jurisdiction of the Tribunal has now been restricted, at least for the time being.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has some concerns about the Government's proposal to reduce the period of seven years to one year. The reason the Government has given for this decision is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain people with the necessary qualifications to serve on the Tribunal in the light of this particular restriction. As one can see, that is clearly a practical problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are proposing a compromise; that is, we amend the legislation to remove that restriction from seven years to the one year, which is the Government's proposal for holders of public office or judges, but not for members of parliament. Whether we like it or not, there is clearly a sensitivity in relation to parliamentary salaries which does not apply to salaries and pensions for public servants or other holders of public office, and it certainly does not seem to be the case in relation to judges.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that it would be very unwise to permit the appointment to the Tribunal of people who have served as members of parliament after a period of only 12 months. I think that it is reasonable to leave that barrier in place; namely, a period of seven years. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill, but we will be moving amendments in accordance with the matters that I have referred to.

         —I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to indicate our essential support for this legislation and our reaction to the amendments that will be proposed by the Opposition. Of course, all Australians have many common hopes and expectations and we rely upon governments to assist us in achieving them. Probably three of the most commonly shared expectations are a secure work income, a secure retirement income and protection against unforeseen accidents, particularly those that might occur in the workplace-in other words, the assurance of compensation for unforeseen accidents that may be associated with fulfilling work tasks.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is not an unreasonable expectation of Australians to have the support of government in this regard. In that respect, this nation is fortunate in that we have procedures in place which are designed to offer us a secure work income, secure retirement income and protection against unforeseen accidents in the workplace.
       </para>
       <para>
        The essential intention of this legislation is to tidy up some of the difficulties, inconsistencies and anomalies which are associated with the third expectation; namely, the administration of Comcare. It spills over into a number of other associated legislative areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are confronted, therefore, with an omnibus Bill containing a number of largely non-contentious amendments, mostly to expand, clarify and streamline existing features, plus amendments of a technical nature. None of the amendments would appear to adversely affect individuals; indeed, they would appear to have the contrary effect. In that respect, this is positive omnibus legislation that we are addressing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main changes relate to premiums payable to Comcare, requirements for certain authorities to discharge Comcare liabilities and changes associated with leave of absence, disclosure of interest and appointment to the Remuneration Tribunal and commissions. A number of deficiencies in the performance of Comcare have been noted and the Auditor-General has identified various problems. Two of these concern breaches of section 98 of the principal Act which deals with premiums. Various proposed amendments correct these anomalies as elaborated and cited by the Auditor-General.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other proposed amendments are intended to improve the operation of the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation (CERC) Act and associated legislation by clarifying certain transitional provisions and correcting some errors and omissions. Others are proposed to make it clear that employees who are entitled to compensation under the Act of 1971 will remain entitled to compensation under the CERC Act without having to satisfy the tests contained in the 1988 Act. Amendments are also proposed to ensure that employees who were parties to proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the day in which the CERC Act commenced, or who incur costs as a result of an appeal by the Commonwealth against a decision of Comcare, will be entitled to recover those costs. There are a series of quite technical amendments, all of which are directed towards apparent anomalies and, we hope, to the subsequent advantage of individuals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition will propose three quite constructive amendments which we see as directed at valid areas of concern in relation to this legislation. The first, as Senator Durack has indicated, is to extend the definition of employee to include persons 65 years of age or older. The Australian Democrats have pursued the issue of discrimination on the basis of age in a variety of contexts and have attempted in the past to highlight discrimination on the grounds of age in this country. I think we are all aware of the fact that Australia is, in fact, an ageing nation and we have to address that demographic fact of life.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are to be the clever country and continue to enjoy the standards of living that we have enjoyed in the past, we must have access to our expertise beyond traditional retiring ages, where individuals feel able to continue in the workplace and where employers feel it appropriate to employ people beyond the ages of 60 and 65. In other words, we believe that the time has arrived to free up our attitudes towards compulsory retirement and break down discrimination in the workplace against people who have previously been considered to be too old, so to speak, to contribute to the work force, when clearly quite often they can continue to do so very effectively. So the Democrats will be supporting the amendment that is being proposed by the Opposition to extend the definition of `employee' to include persons aged 65 years or older.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a Government amendment which seeks to extend the maximum age for members of the tribunals beyond the age of 65. We support this recommendation. The situation is that the Government is finding it difficult to fill positions because the present provisions exclude people of suitable age and suitable qualifications; in other words, potential members of tribunals are excluded by the present provisions that people beyond the age of 65 cannot serve.
       </para>
       <para>
        In line with the principle that I have previously outlined and in view of the fact that many of the people who have the talents necessary for such appointments may have served close to age 60 or beyond, the present exclusion for seven years beyond their retirement age means that much of the talent is simply not available. It is not available for what are now not regarded as valid or sustainable reasons. So the Democrats support an amendment to that age exclusion.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not accept the arguments of the Opposition, however, in relation to the last of its amendments, namely, to exclude parliamentarians from this freeing process of eligibility. We simply argue that to identify parliamentarians as being potentially untrustworthy because they may be able to manipulate the circumstances of their employment is a very negative attitude to adopt towards those in our own profession. We do not believe there is any reason, any justification, for seeing parliamentarians as being potentially any greater abusers of that opportunity than people who may be chosen from other professions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, we suggest that it casts a slur, both upon former members of the Parliament and other members of the Remuneration Tribunal, as it assumes that members of parliament will manipulate perquisites of office to their own advantage, despite the rigorous preselection procedures for appointment to the Tribunal and the wishes of other members of the Tribunal. We believe that there are quite adequate safeguards within the selection procedures that would ensure that any potential abuse by members of parliament simply would not eventuate. We will not be supporting that amendment by the Opposition by virtue of the fact that it is unnecessarily discriminatory. So, in essence, I am saying that the Australian Democrats see this as constructive legislation. We join with the Opposition in supporting it. We will be supporting two of the three amendments that will be proposed by the Opposition.

         —I rise during the second reading debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 to raise a number of issues concerning the industrial relations situation in this country. My colleague Senator Durack has covered the detail of the Bill. I will not go into that in view of the necessity to save time due to the program we have in front of us.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Looking at what has occurred in Australia, particularly in the last day or two, it is apparent that the time has come for the Government to make a very clear statement on where it stands in terms of the future of industrial relations in this country-whether the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under its policy position will in fact remain, or whether it will walk right away from it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say this against the background of a number of areas. The most recent issue is the situation on the Australian waterfront. It is worth noting the response of Mr Bull of the Waterside Workers Federation to yesterday's decision of the Industrial Relations Commission. In doing so, one must turn to yesterday's decision. Today's Australian Financial Review states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In yesterday's decision, the Full Bench said that the commission should not change or abandon the April national wage decision ``unless there has been demonstrated a change of circumstances which justifies this departure''.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a very significant statement. The Full Bench also said that the Commission should not be setting wages and conditions in future until the wage fixing guidelines and principles are established later this year. The national wage case is in total disarray in this country. Reform on the waterfront is in total disarray and people do not know where they are going. The Government needs to make up its mind whether it will operate within the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or whether it will operate outside it. Currently, it is trying to operate both inside and outside it. We see that with the waterfront agreement and we see it with what is happening currently in the meat industry in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wage fixing, which impacts on employment and business confidence, is being totally eroded and destroyed. I put it to Senator Button, who is sitting on the other side of the chamber, that one of the most important things confronting this nation is the need to sort out whether the Labor Government will move to a true enterprise agreement situation or whether it will not, because the whole thing is in absolute total disarray. The waterside will be closed down for at least 24 hours and Robb Jetty, the main meatworks in Western Australia, was closed down for a week. During that period fat lambs which were ready for export actually died in the yards. It is truly a very disgraceful situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        On top of that, yesterday, in answer to a question I asked, Senator Button made it quite clear that he thought it was acceptable for unions to defy, for economic reasons, decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission. To me that is an absolutely hopeless, disgraceful situation.

If we are going to have this system-I do not agree with it but that is beside the point-it is absolutely imperative that, when the Commission makes a decision or recommendation, there is a mechanism to ensure that these decisions are abided by. Otherwise, the so-called umpire-which I have heard about often over the last 12 months-is not an umpire at all.

        In the remaining time available to me-I agreed to restrict myself to seven minutes-let me make the point that I believe it is absolutely essential in terms of the current chaos that exists in this country that the Government make up its mind very quickly and clearly on whether it is going to take a firm stand. It has to adopt a firm policy direction in terms of where wage fixing and productivity agreements are going and how existing work practices, which are pulling this country down, are going to be fixed. In view of the undertaking I gave, I will conclude my remarks.

         —I would like to thank honourable senators for their indication of general support for the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, and for the comments which have been made. I foreshadow that the Government will be opposing the Opposition amendments. The first Opposition amendment relates to the extension of the definition of an employee for the purposes of Comcare. I indicate that the Government will be opposing this amendment because it raises quite complex issues which deserve more thoughtful consideration than we believe has been given it by the Opposition. Those considerations include the relationship between the workers compensation and the social security systems, the whole issue of age discrimination, the issue of age 65 retirement and the role of superannuation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We see the amendment as being-if I might say so without offence, because these are very complex issues-a superficial approach to the matter which shows no signs of grasping these important issues. They are important issues and they have to be debated and grappled with but this amendment is not an appropriate way to do it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, of course, needs to proceed with this legislation as quickly as possible. We do not want to see other elements of the Bill delayed by amendments of this kind. Those other elements of the Bill are critically important to the operation of Comcare and they have to be progressed through the Parliament as quickly as possible. That is not something for which I necessarily blame the Opposition. But the content of the amendment is such that it is not appropriate to be dealt with at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second amendment relates to whether persons aged 65 years and over can be appointed to the Comcare Commission. The Government will advance its view about that issue in the course of the committee stage debate. The third amendment relates to former members of parliament being excluded for seven years from appointment to the Remuneration Tribunal. That amendment will be opposed by the Government for reasons which will be indicated in the course of the committee stage debate. I do not wish to delay the Bill. I commend the second reading of the Bill to the Senate.

        `, and also applies to persons 65 years of age or older'.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said in the second reading debate, the Opposition has adopted a policy against discrimination on the ground of age. The Opposition is well aware that the implementation of such a policy is somewhat complex, simply because of the great variety of legislation in which this restriction appears. Nevertheless, we take the view that where there is the opportunity of changing this in legislation as it appears before the Parliament we will do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government seems to feel that it has to give further consideration to this question of principle. The Minister has said that it is very complex and difficult. I concede that it is a difficult matter, but the Opposition is not as troubled about this matter as the Government, because we have already considered all these difficulties and we have adopted the principle that we are opposed to discrimination on the ground of age. That is the basis of the first two amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Implementation of the first amendment could be more difficult for the Government to manage than the second. The fact that the Government may be prepared not to divide on the second amendment is a hopeful sign: it shows that perhaps the Government is starting to recognise the problem. The only trouble with the Government is that it has not tackled the problem or thought it through, as with so many other things, and apparently it has not been able to come up with a solution. It is for those reasons that I have moved the first amendment. I am very pleased to hear from Senator McLean that the Australian Democrats take the same view as the Opposition on the question of discrimination on the ground of age.

I do not think any- body wants to discriminate against the aged; indeed, I think that current views around the world not only about discrimination but also about the issues of employment and appropriate retirement ages differ from those that were held a few years ago. But the fact of the matter is that the amendment in the context of this Bill creates difficulties because of a whole range of complex relationships between superannuation legislation and provisions generally and their interface and interaction with this Bill. It is difficult to embrace all this and what follows from this amendment in the context of all those inter-relationships. From the Government's point of view, that is a difficulty we have with this proposal and, for that reason, we will be opposing it.

       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Departure Tax Act 1978 to provide that the rate of departure tax be increased from $10 to $20 with effect from 1 August 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to increase departure tax to $20 follows the announcement by the Government in December last year to increase, by $23 million, funding for the promotion of Australia as a tourist destination. The increase in departure tax will serve to offset this additional tourist promotion expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increased promotion will allow Australia to capitalise on recent growth in tourism and will lead to significant job creation. It is estimated that 8700 jobs are created for every 10 per cent increase in international visitor arrivals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's departure tax will remain on a par with similar taxes collected in a number of other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal to increase the rate of departure tax to $20 is expected to double the revenue generated by departure tax and, allowing for tourist growth, is likely to result in an increase in revenue of approximately $35 million in 1991/92 and $37 million in each subsequent year.

         —The purpose of the Departure Tax Amendment Bill is to amend the Departure Tax Act 1978 to provide that the rate of departure tax for those leaving the country by air be increased from $10 to $20 with effect from 1 August 1991. This brings the departure tax back to what it used to be before 1988, and will earn the Government an estimated $35m next year and $37m in each year following.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The increase is intended for the purpose of funding another $23m-worth of promotion of Australia as a tourist destination by the Australian Tourist Commission. We applaud the Government for its long overdue decision to increase promotion to help the industry recover from the 1989 pilots strike and, consequently, we will be supporting the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is unfortunate that the tax increase is necessary when one considers that currently the Government spends only around $40m on tourism promotion out of the $2.7 billion in taxes it already collects from the tourist industry. The Tourist Commission's campaign, which was delayed by the Gulf war, has begun in the United States of America, Japan and Korea, and is apparently receiving a very good response with overseas bookings already increasing substantially.
       </para>
       <para>
        As my colleague the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, Mr David Jull, pointed out in his speech at the second reading stage, the passage of this Bill, which more than adequately covers the cost of promotion, will assist in tourism growth and development in Australia-assistance which is much needed. Living in north Queensland as I do, I am well aware of the way in which the tourist industry was brought to its knees by the pilots strike. My colleagues from various other parts of Australia-Senator Newman from Tasmania, those from the west, even those here in Canberra-are aware of the devastation which was caused to tourism in Australia by the strike which was so badly handled by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        One wonders just how much less damaging that strike would have been had Sir Peter Abeles not held that very secret information about the Australian Labor Party (ALP) at the time of the pilots strike. One can only speculate as to whether the pilots strike might have been over much earlier if Sir Peter Abeles, the head of Ansett Airlines of Australia, had not had information which, had he made it public, would have meant the annihilation of the ALP in the election. That is something we will speculate on for a long time, but it always seemed to us on this side that that strike was carried on for much longer than it should have been by the way that the Government chose to handle it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even now, there is an enormous failure on the part of the Government to recognise the importance of the industry to Australia's economy. Tourism is our largest export earner, generating $6.5 billion in foreign exchange and contributing 5.4 per cent to our gross domestic product. It is also the single biggest private sector employer, providing half a million Australians with jobs. It produced a total of $22.5 billion in tourism expenditure in 1989, $16.5 billion of it in domestic tourism.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, new tourist projects totalling $21.2 billion were firmly committed or under construction as of March last year. These are very telling figures indeed. Quite clearly, the attention paid by this Government to the industry is drastically insufficient. Until there is a wholesale change in its outlook on tourism, the country will continue to reap only a fraction of the benefits there are to be had.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Townsville, where I am based, the ALP-run council has turned the discouraging of tourism, wherever possible, into an art form. The council's flat-earth approach to high-rise development, combined with its tendency to abuse Qantas Airways Ltd, has, more than any other factor, been responsible for the fact that the city's international airport is now practically defunct, that many domestic jet services in and out of Townsville have evaporated, and that it is now cheaper to travel the 400 kilometres to Cairns by bus or plane and then fly south than it is to fly south from Townsville direct.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the deregulated market, Cairns is far more competitive because it encourages tourism. I am informed that the ALP Mayor of Townsville, Alderman Mooney, refused to meet with executives of Compass Airlines Pty Ltd when they visited the city recently because they chose to operate out of Cairns before they chose to operate out of Townsville. We should compare this attitude with the attitude in Cairns, where the non-government owned and operated airport was told recently by Japan Air Lines Co. Ltd that its only worry about the brand new international terminal constructed in Cairns by the Cairns Port Authority was that it might prove to be too small for its future plans.
       </para>
       <para>
        It all comes down to the way one approaches tourism. If one turns away opportunities, as Alderman Mooney and the ALP council in Townsville do, and as this Federal Government does by refusing to liberalise bilateral air agreements to allow foreign carriers in to service Australia, one has to expect to wear the consequences of that sort of attitude and that sort of approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is not contentious. However, my colleague David Jull, as shadow Minister for tourism, did mention that one of the things that has concerned him over the last 13 years of operation of the departure tax is the way that the tax is collected. Many of us who have travelled overseas have lined up at booths at various airport terminals in Australia to pay the $10 or $20 departure tax. We have been subjected to standing in queues. We have even been embarrassed by the way in which some tourists, who have found that they did not have enough money to pay the departure tax, have been treated.
       </para>
       <para>
        In years gone by, collectors have not even accepted American Express or Diners Club credit cards. Some tourists who did not have money would have been amazed to learn that they could not proffer a credit card but that they could sign an IOU. I know that this is hard to believe but it is true.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been told about a Japanese tourist, leaving Australia after a good holiday and, hopefully, having spent $4,000 or $5,000 while he was here, being told by uniformed people to sign an IOU, after discovering that he did not have the money for the departure tax. A little further down the track he started to get dirty pay-up-now notes from the Australian Government saying that he owed this money. This absolutely ridiculous set-up needs to be looked at.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the shadow Minister has said, there must be some way that we can make sure that the departure tax is collected in a better way. It could be a component of the airline ticket, as is done in so many other parts of the world. That would seem to be the sensible way to collect the departure tax. The tax could be part of the airline ticket and the sellers of the ticket would be accountable to the Government for it. This is already done domestically at the Cairns and Hamilton Island airports, just to name a couple, and that is the way it should be done at our international airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some people have argued that maybe the increase in the departure tax from $10 to $20 is too much, but in actual fact our departure tax compares fairly favourably with those in most of the countries in our immediate sphere of influence. I should mention that some of the highest passenger handling fees in the world are in the United Kingdom. The total charges at Heathrow airport are in excess of $80, but at Heathrow people do not line up in front of little booths where someone in a brown uniform demands that they pay their money. It is collected in another way, and it becomes much more acceptable because of the means of collection. I think Australia and the Government should learn a lesson from that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although domestic tourism in Australia provides about 80 per cent of business at this time of economic downturn, the domestic industry is at the present time still very much in real trouble. One would hope that the contribution made to the promotion of Australia as an international destination by this increase in the departure tax will see those numbers increase quite dramatically.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should realise that our share of the world tourism market presently is quite minuscule: we get only about 2 per cent of the North American market and about 4 per cent of Japanese travellers. When we consider that every year some 17 million Americans travel overseas and that some 10 million Japanese will travel overseas this year, we see that our percentage of that business is very small. If we could just double those numbers coming from North America and Japan, the effect on the Australian tourist industry would be absolutely enormous and tremendously beneficial.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that this debate today is on a time limit. I close my remarks by saying that the Opposition welcomes this increase and the fact that money is being poured virtually directly into the promotion of Australia overseas as a major international destination. We have to make sure in these times of economic hardship that we get international visitors here because tourism is one of the few industries that is presently going ahead and that Australia has going for it.

        —Today I will be acting on behalf of the shadow Minister for administrative services, local government and the Australian Capital Territory, Senator Parer, in the carriage of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill. I say right at the outset that the Opposition will be supporting this Bill because we believe it reflects a majority of principles that should be afforded to local government.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In discussions with local government over many years one of the big objections that local government has had to previous distribution of funds has always been the lack of predictability of funding. One of the highlights of the Bill is that in real terms the Minister will be guaranteeing funding for the next three years. In one way, it could be said that this Bill is a mark-time Bill because the Government has put on hold the options on local government funding that were given to it by the Commonwealth Grants Commission report presented in February. My understanding is that guaranteeing financial assistance to local government for the next three years will give local government and the Federal Government breathing space to resolve the very contentious issue of the methodology of funding local government in the future.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senate would know that the question of fiscal equalisation for local government has been a very contentious issue. The options in the Grants Commission report under `Complementary Relativities' would certainly favour the smaller States. The shadow Minister and I have had plenty of correspondence from the smaller States to support that. Conversely, it would seriously disadvantage and be disruptive to funding for New South Wales and Victoria. We also have plenty of letters to support that contention. It is interesting to note that, to my knowledge anyway, the Australian Local Government Association has not made its position clear on the Grants Commission report and the findings therein.
      </para>
      <para>
       By retaining the per capita method of funding for the next three years and guaranteeing the same amount in real terms the Government will be able, hopefully, to resolve the manner in which local government will be funded in future. The only warning I would add is that the Government has allowed itself a safety clause in this legislation; that is, if the economic conditions are not satisfactory or there is a major deterioration in the economy, the Government will have a let-out clause that allows it to reduce its funding to local government. I think it very unlikely, the economy being as bad as it is today, that, having not used that clause already, it would be used.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the questions put to me by local government is why local government should be funded differently from the States in the way that it receives its financial assistance grants. There is no doubt that is a fair question but, in my experience in local government over 14 years, the method of funding for local government has always been a political football. It has always been rather difficult to come up with a fair and equitable manner of funding. I remember quite a few years ago that the Government received a far-reaching report by Professor Peter Self who conducted an inquiry into local government funding. Unfortunately, some of his major recommendations about the problems in some of the smaller States were not taken up by the Government and, in fact, it opted for the per capita system which we have now.
      </para>
      <para>
       Likewise, after this latest report from the Commonwealth Grants Commission, the Government has taken what I believe is the least line of resistance after having been severely criticised at recent meetings, particularly by South Australia. Even though in the Grants Commission report the Office of Local Government and the Department of the Treasury favoured fiscal equalisation in principle, the Government has decided to retain per capita funding. I will not go through all the complexities of the report today because we do not have the time, but many queries were raised in the report about the database and the lack of information that was available for the Commission to come up with a report in which it could recommend fiscal equalisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I agree that there is a need to examine further the options for more equitable funding for local government. This Bill will allow breathing space for that to happen. The Bill also gives the Treasurer discretion to set levels of general purpose assistance grants to local government. It allows changes without frequent amendments to legislation, which I think is most important. Local government is protected in the Bill because the Treasurer has to disclose any changes to the State Minister or the Commonwealth Minister for local government if he is going to use that discretionary power.
      </para>
      <para>
       Over the last few years there have been some examples of unnecessary amendments to legislation which have caused inconvenience to local government. The Senate has had to deal with unnecessary legislation and problems. I believe that this particular discretionary power given to the Treasurer will be of assistance. Honourable senators may remember that in 1988-89 health grants adjustments were identified that had to be legislated for. In 1989-90 adjustments were made because of State housing grants alterations. This year-it is covered in this Bill-the transfer of the debits tax base to the States and Territories has had an effect on the methodology by which local government is funded. Such changes have to be the subject of needless legislation and I think this particular discretionary clause is very good.
      </para>
      <para>
       The contentious part of the Bill as far as the Opposition is concerned is the proposal to attach local road funding to general purpose funding for local government. I know that a lot of people in local government see it as a first stage of absorption. Although the Government has indicated that next year road funding will be identified for roads, it will be coming from Consolidated Revenue, not from the land transport budget. In fact, future funding for local roads will be tied to movements in the level of general assistance grants.
      </para>
      <para>
       The coalition believes that local government has been hoodwinked by this Government into believing that road funding will be identified, when it looks as though it will occur for only one year. I think local government has a genuine concern that the Government has transferred funding for local government for roads from Consolidated Revenue and not from the land transport budget, which means that further down the track we will probably have absorption.
      </para>
      <para>
       We endorse the part in this Bill that proposes to allow local government to use its road funding allocation with more flexibility. I think that has been one of the bugbears of local government for many years. It feels it has been restricted too much in its road funding allocations. As I said earlier, we are fearful that in the future road funding will not be identified and ratepayers will be denied the opportunity to see how much of their fuel tax, which this Government has been thieving from the petrol bowser and putting into Consolidated Revenue, will actually be spent on their roads.
      </para>
      <para>
       I note that Wal Murray, the Deputy Premier in the New South Wales Government, has already urged the Dungog Council to strongly resist any moves by State or Federal governments for local road funding to be untied and paid to local government via general purpose grants. The concern out there is already building up. The coalition has decided not to seek to amend this part of the Bill as it was accepted by the Australian Local Government Association at the recent Premiers Conference. The Bill will also have the effect of allocating to local government a vast amount of its funding in a block grant instead of by the fragmented approach that now exists. This should be applauded. For example, the total amount going to local government at the moment is something like $1.2 billion. The adoption of this Bill will mean that approximately $1 billion in one sum is to be allocated on a quarterly basis and only $200m will be left to be distributed by other means. To some extent it reduces the amount of pork-barrelling that has been going on for many years.

       Under this arrangement, local government also will now receive their moneys promptly and there is no excuse for State governments to retain those funds, which they have done from time to time. I have received correspondence in relation to the fact that some local government areas believe that State governments have sticky fingers and hang on to money for too long, thereby denying funds to those local government areas. Under this arrangement, there will be no excuse for the States to hang on to that money. In fact, I believe that in this particular year local government will have a windfall in that they will have the funds paid from last year plus, under this new arrangement, an up-front payment. That could increase their funding, although it will be over only a temporary period.

       Basically, we do not oppose this Bill. We draw attention to the fact that we are concerned about the low level of road funding. We believe it is essential that the taxpayers and ratepayers of our community know how much of their fuel tax, which they pay at the petrol bowser, goes back into their local roads. We support the Bill because it improves the lot of local government. I know that my colleague Senate Panizza will have more to say about that.

        —Senator Calvert has pointed out the basics and the main thrust of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill, and I will not go over them. I wish to address the matter of funding for local roads, as against regional arterial roads and so on, coming out of the land transport budget into general funding. We have been told that there will be an equivalent reduction in the land transport allocation, but we cannot find where that will occur-unless it is to be part of a land transport Bill later on. It has now been declared that funding for local roads will be untied. As Senator Calvert pointed out, the coalition has decided to go along with that. But that does not mean that we went along with it without a great deal of debate. I can tell the chamber that we did have a great debate on this issue.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I agreed with the idea of untying funding, as we know it. I have a long experience of local government and can say that when funding was given for local roads we were given a budget that was tied to roads and tied to where it could be spent. In other words, a submission had to be put in and a decision would be made to spend it on road No. 37-for instance-between kilometre 45 and kilometre 65. That was ridiculous because some shires were far more efficient than others and could make much more use of their money.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, I applaud the idea of getting away from such tied grants, but I strongly agree with the tying of funds to roads. I believe strongly, and always will, that money allocated in the name of roads should be spent on roads and not on anything else. Otherwise, shires are given the flexibility to use funds allocated in the name of roads on libraries, cultural centres and other things. This could be open to abuse by councils controlled by taxpayers that are not ratepayers as the money could be spent on facilities other than roads. It is not that they do not need such facilities; but I believe there are other ways of funding them. For example, organisations that want a facility may raise a third of the money, local government may put in a third and, hopefully, they may obtain a State grant. However, I will not belabour the point any longer. I believe that funding allocated for roads should go on roads and nothing else because, after all, it is raised in the name of roads. The explanatory memoranda to the Bill tells us that all road funding will be identified at all times, but I presume, as Senator Calvert pointed out, that that might occur for one year and then disappear.
      </para>
      <para>
       My final point is that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) said, in his second reading speech, that local government was in favour of all these points. I cannot speak for all local government in Western Australia, but I certainly had submission after submission from individual councils, as well as the Country Shire Council Association of Western Australia, the Urban Shire Council Association and the Local Government Association. They are not happy with the situation. They would prefer the funding to be identified and tied to roads as at present, rather than there being open slather, which may well be the case. As has been said, the Opposition will support the Bill, but I will continue my argument in the party room to amend the legislation when we are in government.

        —The coalition will be supporting the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill because once again it underlines the bipartisan approach to most environmental matters that exists between all the major parties in Australia. I must say, though, that last night's Cabinet decision on Coronation Hill has managed to ensure that there will be a lack of bipartisan support in that area. A political decision was made on the basis of the need for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to continue to appeal to the left wing of his party in order to retain his position as Prime Minister. Where decisions are made by this Government on the basis of merit, as in this legislation, that bipartisan support will, of course, continue to exist.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       There has been a tendency towards politicisation of the environment in recent times and I hope that the evidence of that, which is so clear today in the Coronation Hill matter, will subside in time. There is no doubt about the bipartisan support over the last 15 years or so for the preservation of one of Australia's greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Bill, which adds a degree of protection to the reef, has the unqualified support of the Opposition. The Bill is intended to decrease the risk of oil and other toxic substances damaging the Great Barrier Reef by requiring all ships over a certain length and carrying specified cargoes to carry pilots while in reef waters. It is aimed at something like only 10 per cent of the 2,000 or so ships in the specified cargo and size categories which are not adhering to the current voluntary system of pilotage. That voluntary system has worked well but it is not comprehensive.
      </para>
      <para>
       By requiring 10 per cent of the 2,000-odd ships in this category to comply, the Government considers-and the Opposition supports it-we are looking at removing the potential risk of damage to the reef. We do have some reservations about the manner in which this pilotage is to be imposed and whether the most efficient system has been introduced by the Government. In view of the pressure to get this legislation through and as this time slot is a non-contentious one, we will not be moving an amendment along the line of argument that was progressed in the House of Representatives. It is self-evidently absurd that the Government has refused to allow individual shipping companies to have their own qualified pilots with the capacity to pilot and has required companies to use an individual and specific pilotage company.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will not be pursuing this matter, although I would be grateful if the Minister could outline a rational reason that individual shipping operators will not be allowed to employ suitably qualified pilots for this purpose. The absence of an appropriate explanation in the other chamber is, at best, disappointing, particularly in the context of the bipartisan approach that has been experienced over time on the need to protect the Great Barrier Reef. I stress the bipartisan nature of the approach because it was a coalition government that inscribed the Great Barrier Reef on the World Heritage List in 1981, so our credentials in this area are certainly high.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been some suggestion-and we support this view-that other areas equally merit this kind of protection. However, we understand that international law inhibits any Australian Government's capacity to broaden the requirements that are in this legislation to require pilotage in this very sensitive area. The coalition supports the Bill.

        —I rise to support the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill. I was a little disappointed to hear Senator Michael Baume again use the term `bipartisan'. I wish the Opposition and the Government would learn to use the term `multipartisan' because we have a number of parties now in this Parliament and, in this particular case, there is multipartisan support for this legislation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As Senator Baume pointed out, the legislation seeks to make compulsory something which has been observed to the extent of some 90 per cent in recent years and that is the carrying of a pilot through the very sensitive inner channel of the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. Senator Baume pointed out that the 10 per cent of ships that do not currently carry pilots will now compulsorily be made to carry such pilots.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will comment on the last point that Senator Baume made in which he argued that this Bill does not allow ships to use their own pilotage if they have a suitably qualified person. I just wonder what proposed section 59f of this Bill actually means, because there is a section which exempts the requirement to navigate with a pilot on written application by the owner of, or the master of, a registered ship. I would have thought that if the ship were carrying a suitably qualified person, that section would allow the Minister to exempt the ship from the application of this legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to make a few remarks about risks of this nature because it seems to me that the risk to the Great Barrier Reef of ships which may be carrying oil or toxic chemical cargoes foundering is in a class which is interesting and there has been quite an extensive debate in the literature, particularly scientific literature, about how one calculates the cost of measures to protect against these sorts of risks. The class is one in which the risk of an accident occurring is small. Many thousands of ships have travelled through this channel and to my knowledge there has been no serious damage to the reef hitherto.
      </para>
      <para>
       The risk is small but the consequences, should an accident happen, can be vast. The debate has really hinged around how one carries out an assessment of the cost benefit analysis of taking measures to prevent those consequences from occurring. Of course, the economists have gone into the area of cost benefit analysis and have attempted to do something that mathematicians know is fraught with a great deal of difficulty; that is, to multiply a factor which is vanishingly small, it approaches zero, with a factor which is very large. If anybody contemplates that simple mathematical operation for a moment, he will realise that that multiplication produces a very rubbery result. Infinity multiplied by zero produces a nonsense result.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, there are a number of other examples in this class. One can think of the possibility of nuclear accidents, where the risks of an accident occurring have been put at very small levels, but the consequences, as we know from Chernobyl, of such an accident occurring in dollar costs and the cost to human life and health are very large. Clearly, some other method of making a judgment as to the measures one puts in place to protect against these unlikely but, should they occur, very costly events is very difficult indeed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would certainly like to congratulate the Government. Having approached this difficult area, nonetheless, and in the light of no serious accidents having occurred so far, it has still sought to legislate for compulsory pilotage through this northern part of the reef, and in so doing increase substantially the protection which will be afforded to the reef and the area immediately to the north of Australia, because I understand the channel extends to the western side of the channel in the vicinity of Thursday Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are other areas of the reef in which I believe the Government is not adequately managing its responsibilities. I was recently on Magnetic Island in the Townsville region to which Senator Macdonald made reference a moment ago. Magnetic Island is in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It has suffered the imposition of a Magnetic Keys marina development which, by any stretch of the imagination, is a disaster and has put a great deal of silt on the reef. Consequent upon the development of that marina, Magnetic Island faces the prospect of a very large intrusion of tourism and the consequences of a large sewage management problem in that effluent will go out on to the reef.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was a disappointment to me to note that, in relation to the proposed multifunction polis in Adelaide, the Government is contemplating using techniques such as MEMTEC, membrane technology, to handle the sewage discharges into a marine environment-I am not disagreeing with that-but in the case of imminent damage to an existing world heritage area, Magnetic Island, is not prepared to contemplate the application of that MEMTEC technology to sewage treatment.
      </para>
      <para>
       I appeal to the Government to reconsider that sort of situation. Throughout the Great Barrier Reef greater attention should be paid to using some of these tourist development areas as test areas for better managing things such as general effluent run-off and discharge from sewage. Even though the sewage may be treated, it is nutrient rich and has damaging properties to the marine environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       As Senator Baume has indicated, we are very grateful that the Government is bringing this legislation forward. We support it. We believe that it will add significantly to the protection of the reef against accidents which may be small in terms of the likelihood of them happening, but could be extremely disastrous should such an accident happen involving a large tanker or a ship carrying a noxious chemical cargo.

        Section 59h of the principal Act deals with the defences that an accused may raise in relation to navigating in the compulsory pilotage area without a pilot. The accused, under subsection (1), can raise the defence of stress of weather or other unavoidable cause. Subsection (2) provides that this defence must be proved by the accused on the balance of probabilities. An accused owner of a vessel may raise the defence under subsection (3) that he did not aid, abet, counsel or procure or was not in any way party to the navigation of the ship in the compulsory pilotage area.

       <para>
        The way the section is currently drafted, it is not clear what the level of proof should be in subsection (3). The drafting implies that a different level of proof is required for the defence provided in subsection (3) than that provided in subsection (1). The amendments I have moved correct this problem and make it clear that proof on the balance of probabilities applies to the whole section. I commend the amendments to the Committee.

       <para>
        Our concern is that section 59 does grant an exemption, as Senator Coulter has just said, but Senator Coulter's exemption bears no relationship whatsoever to the point I was making, which is that under these requirements the pilot is not permitted to belong to the vessel; in other words, there cannot be an employed pilot. An operator, for example, who provides a provisioning operation in those waters, and who has continual trips in that region, cannot employ his or her own pilot and, in effect, a pilotage company must be employed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cost of such pilotage can be very great. It can be up to $10,000 a trip. I ask the Minister to tell us as a courtesy why shipping operators are not permitted to employ their own pilots? I stress that proposed new section 59f, which allows exemptions, does not allow exemptions on the basis of someone having a pilot. It specifically excludes that. It only grants exemptions if, in the Minister's opinion, the use of a pilot would not improve the environmental protection of the reef. Senator Coulter's misreading of that clause--

         —I am struggling to catch up, because I am obviously not familiar with the legislation. If the problem lies in the definition of `pilot' not extending to an employed pilot, it seems to me as a lawyer, rather than as the Minister in charge, that section 59f allowing exemptions from the use of a pilot would be applicable in this situation. If `pilot' means anyone other than an employed pilot elsewhere in the Bill, it must also mean that for the purposes of the exemption provision in section 59f. Under these circumstances, it is possible for the Minister to grant an exemption from the use of an external pilot if in the Minister's opinion to require that ship to navigate with an external pilot, that is a non-employed one, would not improve environmental protection, and so on. In other words, if the definition is as Senator Michael Baume says, then it is also that definition for the purpose of section 59f and the exemption provision would apply.

        There is some policy reason which underlies, I am told, the legislation as a whole for not normally allowing a pilot to belong to a ship and creating a situation where the master is the pilot as well. There is a good policy reason for not accepting that as the normal state of affairs. In a specific case of the kind Senator Baume describes, where there is a separate employed pilot with designated pilot responsibilities and is so qualified and that case can be made to the Minister, then it seems to me that, subject to any correction, section 59f would do the job of exemption in the circumstances described, which seem perfectly reasonable ones in which to seek such an exemption.

I hope that under the Acts Interpretation Act, the discussion that we just had now will add meaning and teeth to the proposition that I have been putting. Otherwise, the absence of such a statement appears to us to leave a most unsatisfactory situation. We hope that the Government will monitor this to ensure that unless there are very sound reasons approvals are given for individual ship operators to have employed pilots without its being up to the whim of the Minister; rather, the onus should be on him to allow it to happen.

Australia is concerned to develop an appropriate relationship with Fiji as a regional friend and neighbour. We are concerned with the human rights situation in that country, as are a number of other countries around the region and the world. We will not shrink from taking appropriate opportunities to articulate our concerns. I notice Senator Hill's repeated references to the inappropriateness of my statement about the Fiji constitutional situation in the United Nations last year and remind him that he was sitting in the Australian delegation seats at the UN at the time and made no adverse comment, as I recall it, in relation to any aspect of that speech; not least that relating to Fiji. He has been a very late and delayed learner so far as his belief in the inappropriateness of making public comment is concerned.

        Australia and other countries around the world do remain concerned at the situation whereby the Fiji Constitution represents a significant lessening of the rights of some of the citizens of that country as compared with the case previously. We recognise the reality that that Constitution is now in place and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. We will act accordingly in gradually rebuilding our relationship. We still have an inhibition on the re-establishment of defence cooperation with that country for reasons that are obviously associated with the fact that the present government is still an interim one. It has not been sanctioned by any election and owes its existence originally to a military coup. We will reconsider that position-as will New Zealand, as indicated by Mr McKinnon in his visit yesterday-after the next election is held in Fiji.

I am sure that His Excellency the Prime Minister will respond accordingly.

It was that particular Party that made a decision last year, on a fraternal basis, to assist a certain party, the Labor Party in Fiji, with some of its administrative expenses.

         —I am glad that Senator Reynolds has raised the question of the funding and the location of community legal aid centres throughout Australia. These legal centres provide a tremendous opportunity for members of the community to obtain advice in a very accessible and friendly way in the various centres distributed, I have to admit, mainly around the capitals of Australia rather than in the provincial areas of Australia and in the outback areas with which Senator Reynolds is particularly familiar as a representative from northern Queensland.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That has to be put against the historical context. The genesis of many of these community legal aid centres was in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Groups of lawyers, particularly in the inner cities of, say, Sydney or Melbourne-Redfern, for example-got together and established these community legal centres. It was not a Federal initiative; it was a matter that came out of community concerns-well based concerns-amongst lawyers and other community workers in the inner cities of Sydney and Melbourne in particular. Eventually those legal centres attracted Federal funding and support. That has been continued because they provide an exceptional service in those communities. I think that has been recognised in respect of the advice which they give, the educational services which they provide and the law reform initiatives which they sponsor, foster and promote.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, Senator Reynolds would acknowledge that it has been difficult in these constrained times to provide funding for the expansion of the community legal centre (CLC) services throughout Australia in the provincial towns and in the outer suburban areas of our major cities. At the moment the most that I have been able to do is to keep the funding for existing community legal centres up to real terms, given the inflation that has occurred in recent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as northern Queensland and other regional areas of Australia are concerned, I acknowledge that there are inequities in the provision of community legal centres. At the most recent meeting of the committee advising me on CLC funding, the national representatives acknowledged the legitimacy of the claim upon those scarce funds by such areas as Townsville. As a result, it has been suggested that the funding guidelines ought to be reviewed to try to switch some funds from the cities to those provincial centres. I look forward to a further report on that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        A national conference of Australian community legal centres will be held in Adelaide next month and I am sure that that matter will be on its agenda. I hope the community legal centres can help me in a re-ordering of funding priorities to assist in the way that Senator Reynolds and other honourable senators would like to see. This process of re-ordering of priorities has to enjoy the confidence of the community legal centres movement around Australia, and I can assure the Senate that whatever steps are taken will have the benefit of full consultation with those community legal centres and their representatives.

        The Government does place very high priority on the need for listed companies to provide investors with all relevant information relating to the affairs of the company and, in particular, the company's financial position. It is for that reason that only today the Attorney-General released a press statement indicating that he believes there is a great deal of concern amongst investors that they may not be as well informed as they ought to be about the ongoing state of the companies in which they have invested. For that reason, he has commissioned an examination by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee of the need for a legislatively based continuous disclosure regime and the nature of any such scheme. The Committee has been asked to report within two months.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the light of that initiative, the publication by the Australian Stock Exchange of its draft new listing rules is extremely timely and I expect that that draft will form part of the basis of the consideration by the Advisory Committee of the question of continuous disclosure regime in relation to the financial affairs of companies.

One of these issues was, of course, the settlement of boundaries between the then warring parties of 1967 and 1973-boundaries which have never been determined; whereas in the case of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, established and recognised boundaries were blatantly violated. The onus for the implementation of those resolutions has thus never rested exclusively with Israel. Indeed, Senator Coulter will recall that the Arab side which had lost territory in both wars was, for several years, quite ambivalent about those resolutions, mainly because they implied recognition of the state of Israel.

       <para>
        As to the second part of the question, Australia has supported the sanctions against South Africa in order to put pressure on a government which had institutionalised racism through its constitution and through its whole legal system. That is not the case with Israel, as the Australian Parliament overwhelmingly agreed in 1986. I hope Senator Coulter will again recall the resolution calling for the overturn of the United Nations General Assembly resolution 3379 equating Zionism with racism. For this reason, and for the other distinctions I mentioned earlier, sanctions, in our judgment, are an inappropriate way of achieving implementation of resolutions 242 and 338.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, we do wholeheartedly support the very determined efforts that are being made by the United States-and Jim Baker in particular-in the aftermath of the Gulf war to bring about a Middle East peace conference based on those resolutions and the principle of land for peace. We continue to urge all states in the region to cooperate with those US efforts.

        In relation to the third part of Senator Coulter's question about support for the PLO, Australia has accepted for many years that the PLO does represent the opinion of a significant proportion of the Palestinian people and we have certainly been prepared to deal with the PLO on that basis. We do not, however, accept the PLO's claim to be the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the last part of Senator Coulter's question about opinion polls, the polls to which I referred with regard to South Africa were aimed at demonstrating the relative support within sections of the black community for competing political parties and organisations. No readily comparable situation exists with regard to competing organisations among the Palestinian people. But I certainly acknowledge, as I have already just said, that the Government does understand clearly that there is a very significant level of support for the PLO among Palestinians. We have made clear our position with regard to the PLO and we see no reason at this time to review our policy in relation to that organisation.

         —Of course, it was not just a matter of announcing a new package on disability reform before one could have medical examinations mandated by the Department of Social Security. Clearly, the basis has always been there in relation to invalid pensions for medical examinations to be ordered-there is nothing new in that. If anything, under the new package-which, of course, the Parliament will not debate for some time yet-the actual level of medical dysfunction becomes even more important in determining eligibility for payment. So I could not promise that medical examinations will not be ordered because, on occasion, they will be absolutely necessary in order to determine whether there is any eligibility in the first place.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I did see this report. I think it confuses Newstart and the disability reform package. But, most importantly, it ignores past practice, current practice and what has been promised for the future. When it comes to the disclosure of information, obviously in the announcement of the package it is clear that at some point in time the Department of Community Services and Health, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and my own Department will have officers sitting down and looking at a person's disability and whether that person ought to be eligible for a training program. If eligibility for the training program is determined, obviously that person will be expected to take it up. If rehabilitation is expected, that person will be expected to take that up as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important to note when talking about the disclosure of medical details that there is no way in the world that the Department can break the Privacy Act, the Social Security Act or any other restrictions that are placed on the release of information. Medical records cannot and will not be made available except in the sharing in that meeting that I have just explained between departments, and even then they will take place under those Acts with the restrictions that have always applied still applying.
       </para>
       <para>
        More importantly, when it comes to the Commonwealth Employment Service placing a client who has some disability with an employer, medical details can be made available to the employer-and often are-but always with the client's consent. It is important to note that none of that changes with the announcement of the package.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of its strictness, it is worth noting that we have been careful to make sure that penalties will not be applied straightaway in the disability support areas and will not take place for the first two years so that we can work through the new system and see what penalties for failure to attend examinations, rehabilitation or whatever seem appropriate. When there is a major reform of this kind, we do not race in with heavy penalties. Rather, we see how the system works and, with disabled organisations, we can determine later what penalties ought to apply to organisations for failure to meet reasonable requirements later on.

I did undertake yesterday, in answer to Senator Hill, to check my recollection of the detailed approval process that had taken place for that $2m two-year program of assistance for the development of economic planning capacity in South Africa, which I announced on 11 June.

        I have done so, and the situation is that, as has already been indicated in answers to questions in the Senate by me on 14 May and by the Prime Minister in the other place on 29 May, the initiative for this program came from the Prime Minister; its general outline and its proposed order of magnitude were agreed in various discussions between the Prime Minister, me and the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development in the month of April; and its detailed content was the product of recommendations received from the mission led by Professor Garnaut which visited South Africa at the Prime Minister's request from 9 to 16 May.
       </para>
       <para>
        A Cabinet submission incorporating the proposal with an indicative first year figure of $1m for 1991-92 was lodged by me back on 3 May following consultations with my portfolio colleague with responsibility for aid matters, Dr Blewett. Following consideration of new policy priorities by a subcommittee of the Expenditure Review Committee (ERC), consisting of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Minister for Finance, that proposal was specifically considered and endorsed as appropriate new policy by the full Expenditure Review Committee on 6 June. That was in my absence overseas; thus my imperfect recollection yesterday. I knew the matter had been dealt with, but I could not specifically remember the occasion: it was in fact when I was overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        As is the case with all new policy proposals incorporated in the Budget, consideration and endorsement of ERC decisions by the full Cabinet will not occur until the details of the Budget are finally settled in early August.
       </para>
       <para>
        The timing of the Government's decision on this program was governed by several considerations: the view of Professor Garnaut's delegation that the efforts should be commenced quickly; the timing of the Commonwealth high level advisory group meeting in London, which had been scheduled for 10 June; and my own visit to South Africa. The announcement was made in Johannesburg on 11 June. For the record I now seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard at the conclusion of my answer.

Four per cent for the establishment costs of the Department of Economic Planning of the African National Congress will be provided directly to the ANC, as I have said previously.

        AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ANNOUNCES ASSISTANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC PLANNING CAPACITY IN SOUTH AFRICA
       </para>

        The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, made the following announcement today in Johannesburg:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Government will sponsor a new program to help develop the capacity of the democratic anti-apartheid movement to play an effective role in the sound economic management of post-apartheid South Africa.
       </para>
       <para>
        The program looks ahead to the day when South Africa has completed its transition to a non-racial and democratic system of government. It will focus on improving the quality of economic debate, analysis and policy development among members of the anti-apartheid movement and on helping improve training in economics, especially among the Black community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The program will be a practical and concrete contribution by Australia to the capacity of future democratic governments in South Africa. It will see an expenditure of about R4 million (about $A2 million or $US1.5 million) over the next two years, and will be additional to pledges already announced for the present triennium under Australia's Special Assistance Program for South Africans (SAPSA).
       </para>
       <para>
        The program will include the following elements.
       </para>
       <para>
        - Short term: the establishment costs of a Department of Economic Planning for the ANC; exchanges of visits to and from Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        - Medium term: the establishment of an Institute of Economic Research at a South African university; consultancies and training and research projects.

        - Long Term: economic scholarships.
       </para>
       <para>
        Full details of the program are attached.
       </para>
       <para>
        The program, an initiative of Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, arises from Mr Hawke's long-standing concern, discussed on a number of occasions with leaders of Black opinion (most recently with Nelson Mandela), about the vital importance to the future of South Africa and its region of a well-managed, post apartheid economy. At Mr Hawke's direction, a delegation led by Dr Ross Garnaut of the Australian National University visited South Africa from 9 to 16 May 1991 to open a dialogue on economic policy and to develop recommendations on ways in which Australia could assist the ANC and other elements of the democratic anti-apartheid movement in their economic analysis and policy making capacities. The delegation held discussions with a wide range of individuals and organisations including the ANC, PAC and COSATU, the business community, Government officials and academic economists at several universities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delegation concluded that a package of assistance in this area could help ease the transition in South Africa and enhance the capacity of a democratic government in South Africa effectively to run the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The delegation considered that the economic challenge facing such a government will be immense, that the assistance is needed, and that it should begin soon. In accepting the delegation's recommendations, the Australian Government is taking a practical lead in helping South Africa meet the economic challenge that lies ahead.

       <para>
        If Australian ideas and experience are going to help inform democratic movement thinking, one of the quickest routes is via brief, focused visits to Australia by senior figures who would meet with senior Australians concerned with economic management and economic issues in government, the ACTU, business and Universities. This would not exclude a smaller element of visits by Australians who could contribute to the discussion of economic policy.

       </para>
       <para>
        Australian contributions to the economic policy discussion can be effective through focused consultancies in specialised areas (e.g. aspects of taxation policy). Australian experts would come to South Africa following the identification of priorities in consultation with the democratic movement. They would be based at university research centres but would have internal travel funds for consultations with the democratic movement and workshops at other Universities where serious work is being undertaken on economic policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        (D) Institute of Economic Research, at a selected University (Director plus establishment costs, some establishment cost and printing year two). USD 188,000 (USD 90,000 in 1992-93).
       </para>
       <para>
        The ANC is negotiating with the economics discipline at a South African University on the establishment of an independent Economic Research Institute which would nevertheless focus on policy issues of priority to the democratic movement. Subject to a satisfactory outcome guaranteeing (a) independence, (b) professional standards, and (c) University support, funding will be provided to cover the salary of the Institute's Director and the establishment costs of this small unit (including a documentation centre).
       </para>
       <para>
        Such an Institute would fill a real gap. Traditionally South African Universities have produced little economic policy research. Business organisations have been able to produce their own research, but issues of special concern to disadvantaged groups have in the past been largely ignored. The University chosen should have a good academic reputation for economics, a central location and a continuing contact with the democratic movement.

       <para>
        This specialised course is intended to upgrade Black economists, including democratic movement leaders whose economic training needs to be updated. The course is designed to cover approximately nine months, embracing theory, practice and research. It represents an optimal means of increasing the number of qualified Black economists as rapidly as possible whilst ensuring that they can make a contribution to the South African debate. Provision for short secondments to economic and financial institutions should encourage the eventual employment of the upgraded economists in positions of influence. Funding would depend on the University agreeing to accept this as a diploma course.

        This ongoing project is based at an academic institution closely involved in the analytic study of issues of concern to the democratic movement. The project focuses, inter alia, on the relationship between bargaining structures, wage growth and macroeconomic performance. There is also a special emphasis upon spreading awareness of the results of research (e.g. the March workshop on budgeting for redistribution in which the union and civic leaders). The project is also able to draw on the resources of the Association of Democratic Economists which incorporates economists who focus on policy issues at the three Cape Universities and elsewhere.

As a result of this, is it a fact that the Review of Resource Priorities Committee is considering the closure of the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) in Scottsdale, which is the heartland of north-east Tasmanian potato, pea and other food production? Does the Minister realise the drastic effect that this would have in Scottsdale and, indeed, in Tasmania? Does the Minister realise that the MRL closure would result in the Australian Defence Force losing its expertise in food technology, food analysis, engineering and nutrition and energy expenditure, and that the Australian Army would have to import freeze-dried rations from New Zealand? Finally, in view of the fact that an effective army marches on its stomach, how can the Minister himself stomach the closure of the MRL, thus denying the Australian Army self-reliance in this vital area?

         —This is one of those sorts of questions when we run up the flag and see who salutes. It is quite clear, though, that in the force structure review we indicated that we regarded DSTO as overstaffed, especially in the support staff area. We have been trying over a number of years, but with increasing acceleration, to get the ratio between support staff and scientists to a level that we find acceptable. DSTO within the Australian context is the second largest employer in the sciences. There has been no decision at this stage in regard to Scottsdale. Obviously, every facility in DSTO is being examined and, once that examination is complete, recommendations will be made to me. I cannot anticipate now whether or not Scottsdale will be closed, but I can acknowledge some of the points Senator Harradine has made-that it has had a very good track record in regard to food technology; that the Australian Defence Force's ration packs, et cetera, are the envy of many other defence forces around the world. Indeed, if we had had an enormous stock of them, I guess the United States of America have bought them all during the Gulf war. It certainly did make inquiries at the time as to the number we could make available. We did not have a couple of million in stock; otherwise I think we could have disposed of them.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Harradine mentioned the effect on the local economy, and these are tough decisions if they are ever made. I have had to make some tough decisions and I have made them irrespective of the effect on local economies and, indeed, of the political allegiances in a particular area. I also make the point that wherever Defence has decided to wind up an involvement-I am not anticipating here-we always try to leave something behind that is of equal value. I could go through several other examples around Australia where we are intending to close down but, by redevelopment, leave as many jobs as we take. But at this stage I cannot give Senator Harradine an assurance, as I cannot give an assurance in relation to any facility, that it will not close down. Yet, on the other hand, I can say with all honesty at this stage that there is no plan to close that facility. It is just that every facility in DSTO right around Australia-and there are a large establishment at Salisbury, two large establishments in Melbourne, an establishment in Cairns and an establishment in Tasmania-will be looked at and a final decision made. Given the importance of food technology for the armed services, it has to be said that they have a strong case for continuation. But I have to await the report back from DSTO. It may not come for another year as it does its forward plans through to the twenty-first century.

        I can say that, as a general principle, Australia does support a stronger role for the UN in strengthening collective security arrangements, but the UN does not have carte blanche to unilaterally intervene in a nation's domestic affairs. United Nations action which impinges upon the domestic jurisdiction of a member state is governed by article 2.7 of the Charter, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Nothing in the Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, or shall require the members to submit such matters to settlement under the present charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.
       </para>
       <para>
        What all that means is that the UN, unless it undertakes enforcement action of the kind that we saw, for example, in the Gulf conflict, has to have the agreement of the respective member state to take any action in relation to questions of self-determination. Thus, UN involvement in the resettlement of the Kurds in northern Iraq has resulted from an agreement between the UN and the Iraqi Government to enable such a UN role to be established.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Government's general approach to the resolution of questions of self-determination in areas of conflict has been necessarily to address these on a case by case basis with respective governments, while indicating that we respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those governments. As Senator Vallentine will be well aware, we have also been very active in discussing human rights matters, including the problems of the various minorities mentioned by her. We do have a very strong record in urging those countries to respect the individual and collective human rights of their peoples. But in each case, as I guess again Senator Vallentine will be aware, there are complex and individual problems which do require careful handling.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been particularly active in our region with the proposal to President Premadasa that Sri Lanka's government, for example, consider using the good offices of the Commonwealth in finding a solution to the problems faced by the Tamils. I have also detailed on a number of occasions what we have been doing in Bougainville. I think our commitment to and engagement in the region is well known. It would be far too tedious for me to go through all the other specific instances that Senator Vallentine mentioned, but I would of course be happy to talk to her at any stage about those specific cases.

         —I refer the Minister for Administrative Services to questions that I raised with him during the Appropriation Bills debate relating to his Department's improper use of media monitoring consultants for political purposes and to his response to me on 6 May wherein he confirmed that the charge for media monitoring for the period July 1990 to February 1991 averaged less than $4,500 a month, and that for the months of March and April this year the charges were a whopping $18,260 and $17,700 per month. I ask: what was the purpose of the media monitoring and how does he justify using taxpayers' funds through his Department for purely political purposes?

         —This is very much a recycled question. As Senator Parer indicated in his foreword to the question, he has asked it before and had the answers before. I cannot add anything further to what I said in this place some few weeks ago during the committee stage of the Appropriation Bill, and that is that he should take into account that, as public interest increases in issues related to the Department, obviously there will be a greater need for information to come to us.

        The other point I made at the time was that the resources of the media monitoring facility are used by both me and my office, as well as senior departmental officers. That was also given in response to Senator Parer at an earlier time. As I said then, the basic value of media monitoring is that the Government, the Department and all involved in public administration have a very clear and direct idea of what public attitudes are and what points are raised in public debate, with a view to taking them into account when making decisions. As I also said at the time, the use of such a facility is one that is widespread, not only I would believe on a Federal government level but also on a State government level, as well as internationally.

         For the ten month period July 1990 to end April 1991 the charge for media monitoring made on the Department averages out at $7 356 per month. Not surprisingly, with extensive media attention given to a number of issues which come within the Department's area of responsibility (**(viz contract administration, disclosure laws and political advertising)**) the monthly charge made by the service has increased to $18 260 and $17 700 for March and April respectively. This increase is seen as temporary (** and directly related to concurrent media interest in several topical matters **).

I also refer to the fact that sole parents are permitted to earn $15 a week in maintenance income for one child and a further $5 a week for each additional child in maintenance income before their pension is reduced. This contrasts with a limit of $40 a week for income from other sources before their pension is reduced. Firstly, does the Minister acknowledge that failure to address this situation has disadvantaged custodial parents, in particular those who are reliant on only the sole parent pension and maintenance? Secondly, in view of his reported concern for sole parents and their children, will the Government be moving to treat maintenance income on the same basis as other earnings for the purpose of the income test for the sole parent pension; and, if not, why not?

The figures that Senator Lees gives on the maintenance income test for sole parents, at what point the penalty is suffered and the other penalty-free area are correct. It has to be noted that, from memory, there was a wrong figure in that article. At the moment, about $10m a month is paid in maintenance as a result of the setting up of the Child Support Agency, so many thousands of sole parents and their children have been the beneficiaries of that maintenance. It means that custodial parents are taking on responsibilities that they have never had before. It should be acknowledged that for many sole parent families that has been of particular benefit. I mention that because the figure in the article is $40m a month. I wish it were true, but that is quite clearly an exaggeration.

         —As Senator O'Chee would be aware, on 13 May the Government decided that negotiations should proceed with all potential purchasers of the Associated Plywoods Sales sawmill in Ravenshoe regarding some Commonwealth financial assistance to ensure that the mill could continue to operate. Of course, the continued operations of the mill has always been our priority. Since that date the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has undertaken a detailed examination of the proposals for the mill's future that were submitted by three potential purchasers. They were the Simms Consortium, Greys Sawmilling and Jiddabul Aboriginal Corporation.

       <para>
        This examination included an assessment of the financial aspects of each proposal by the Department's accounting advisers and an assessment of the technical aspects of operating the mill by an independent timber and sawmilling industry expert, as well as discussion and meetings with the proponents of each proposal. The Minister has now considered the advice provided on those proposals and has decided to authorise further negotiations with the Simms Consortium. The Department has advised each of the proponents and the receivers and managers of the mill of this decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        If those negotiations, which are being expedited, are successful, and the receivers are aware of them, I am very hopeful that an agreement can be made on a purchase price, on the level and method of government assistance in that purchase, and also agreement on accountability for it before the date of auction. I understand that the auction was to take place by the end of June. I am sure that in the light of the Minister's announcement we might be able to get an extension of that date, if it is necessary, although I hope that the matter will be resolved before that proposed date and we will be able to see the mill return to its full operating capacity.

        SENATOR BUTTON: On 15 May 1991, at Hansard page 3373, Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it a fact that the Commissioner of Taxation is denying primary producers the right to change the basis of valuation of livestock in these recessed conditions from cost to market price under a section 33 discretion of the Income Tax Assessment Act? This refusal is based on the grounds that a general fluctuation in livestock prices, where the market movement is one occasioned by widely prevailing economic circumstances, is not sufficient to warrant a change in the manner in which taxation on livestock is assessed. Is not such a decision uncaring, unreasonable and destructive? Will not such decisions cause unwanted financial hardship to primary producers caused by a collapse in sheep livestock market prices?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commissioner of Taxation has, wherever possible, adopted a sympathetic approach in exercising his discretion under section 33 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, the Commissioner as a matter of public duty must take into account all considerations relevant to the intent of that section in order to exercise his discretion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until 1936, a primary producer's election to adopt either cost or market value for stock on hand was irrevocable. This was changed with the enactment of section 33. Section 33 provides that a taxpayer shall not, except without the leave of the Commissioner, adopt a basis of valuation of his live stock taken into account at the end of the year of income different from the basis on which the valuation of his livestock was made when it was last taken into account at the end of a previous year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the amendment stated that the election to change may be made, for instance, where a partnership is created and the various members desire a common basis for bringing the value of the livestock of the partnership to account.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commissioner takes the view that the enactment of section 33 was made to apply in very narrow circumstances, such as where there was a change in the business arrangements, and that it was not enacted so as to allow primary producers to change the basis of valuation of stock on hand because of mere price fluctuations.
       </para>
       <para>
        If a primary producer was able to change the basis of valuation because of changes in seasonable or economic conditions the Commissioner could be placed in the situation of never being able to arrive at the true profit of the primary producer. This state of affairs could be maintained on an indefinite basis, due to the rise or fall in prices in the rural sector. A consistent method of valuation is needed for the Commissioner to make a proper assessment of a taxpayer's income.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, few primary producers if any, would be able to ascertain accurately the cost price of their live-stock after having adopted market value for one or more years. This would be a particular problem in relation to live stock acquired by natural increase in the year following acquisition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Primary producers are entitled to average their incomes over five years and can also participate in the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme. It is these provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act which have been designed to compensate farmers for the fluctuations in their incomes. Few other taxpayers have these or similar entitlements.

        <para>
         Senator Spindler asked me, as Minister representing he Treasurer, a question without notice concerning Tate &amp;Lyle's takeover of Bundaberg Sugar. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government welcomes direct foreign investment which is consistent with the needs of the Australian community.
        </para>
        <para>
         - Proposals in the majority of industry sectors are approved unless judged contrary to the national interest.
        </para>
        <para>
         The foreign investment policy was significantly liberalised in 1986/87 when the net economic benefits test was replaced by the not contrary to the national interest criteria.
        </para>
        <para>
         - Since then few proposals have been rejected on national interest grounds apart from those involving developed residential real estate.
        </para>
        <para>
         - Investors can expect that approval will not be withheld from a proposal on national interest grounds other than in unusual circumstances affecting Australia's vital interests and development.
        </para>
        <para>
         Against the background of Australia's current account deficit and foreign debt burden, it would be singularly inappropriate to be tightening foreign investment policy across the board.
        </para>
        <para>
         - To do so would have an adverse effect on the long term direct foreign investment necessary for Australia's future growth and development, the creation of jobs, the restructuring of the economy to make Australia competitive internationally and improved living standards.
        </para>
        <para>
         - The foreign investment policy of the Democrats would greatly curtail foreign investment in Australia and that policy would undoubtedly be contrary to the national interest.
        </para>
        <para>
         In the case of Tate and Lyle, policy does not require the parties to demonstrate net economic benefits and the Government was satisfied that the proposal was not contrary to the national interest after taking into account:
        </para>
        <para>
         - The views of the Queensland Government and the Trade Practices Commission;
        </para>
        <para>
         - Representations from interested parties including the Queensland Cane Growers and Bundaberg Sugar Co Ltd;
        </para>
        <para>
         - Tate &amp;Lyle's actions as soon as its executive became aware of a potential restrictive trading agreement with British Sugar PLC in ending the arrangement and informing the appropriate authorities; and
        </para>
        <para>
         - the fact that although Bundaberg is a significant sugar miller, a successful Tate and Lyle takeover would only put the UK company in control of 5% of the Australian refined sugar market.
        </para>
        <para>
         There were no conditions attached to the Government's approval of the Tate and Lyle proposal.

        <para in-line="1">
         —Yesterday Senator Reid asked me a question about the proper definition of development assistance and scholarship guidelines. The answer is as follows. The 1989-90 Special Assistance Program for South Africans annual report, which I will now table, contains a schedule-Annex B-which lists the 41 non-government organisations (NGO) funded from the SAPSAN allocation. Annex C of the report also gives a breakdown of the number of black South Africans and refugees who receive training assistance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also seek leave to incorporate in Hansard at the conclusion of this answer a two-page schedule giving a list of projects funded from the SAPSAN allocation in 1990-91, the expenditure incurred during this financial year and the voluntary organisation responsible for administration and initial audit.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the financial year has not yet closed, details on training benefits are still being compiled. As soon as the 1991 SAPSAN annual report is completed, a copy will be made available to Senator Reid. These reports are available to any senator who is interested. As can be seen from the description of the projects in the tabled report, all of these activities are properly what I described yesterday as quintessentially development assistance, with clearly a very heavy emphasis on training and education. As the SAPSAN report shows, scholarships are provided through numerous channels. In the case of full sponsored bursaries, Nassau fellowships and Nassau study places, selection is through the Commonwealth Secretariat. Australian NGOs are responsible for the selection of their bursary and training students. In all cases of South African student exiles attending Australian institutions, they must evidently meet the normal academic entry requirements of those institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of in-region scholarships, students meet local academic entry requirements which are often stricter for non-nationals. It is not Australia's practice to means-test refugees applying for scholarships, nor does the Australian Government means-test any of the students nominated for government to government scholarships under the sponsored training program.

        Notes: Even where first line auditing responsibility is with international organisations AIDAB allocates funds on an accountable basis. Written agreements specify the purposes for which aid funds are granted. Apart from checks by desk and embassy staff, AIDAB also uses internal and external auditors and is subject to review by the Office of the Auditor-General. Expenditure by overseas posts is also audited by DFAT auditors. In 1990 SAPSA expenditure by posts in Harare, Lusaka, Nairobi and Pretoria was audited by DFAT'S auditors.

         —Yesterday Senator Kemp asked me a question about reporting on the use of Australian funds under the Special Assistance Program for South Africans (SAPSAN) in the four years to July 1990. I give him the following further answer. As noted by him, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) review team's report on the special assistance program, which I tabled earlier-it is part of AIDAB's auditing process-picked up some instances where some small non-government organisations operating within the front-line States of South Africa, in dealing with training and educational programs for refugees and/or disadvantaged black South Africans, have not always been timely and sufficiently detailed as far as listing students' courses and the like is concerned. In some cases these problems have resulted from the use of aliases by refugees and the difficulty experienced by non-government organisations in reconciling details is quite understandable. For example, the education office in Lusaka was one of those bombed in 1988. In all cases appropriate follow-up action has been initiated. Post activities, including this funding, in Harare, Lusaka, Nigeria and Pretoria were audited in 1990 by the Department's auditors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Most of the aid projects funded from the SAPSAN allocation are administered through Australian or international voluntary organisations such as Austcare; the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad; Community Aid Abroad; the Overseas Service Bureau; and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. These voluntary organisations are responsible for audits of funds they are administering and for the submission of reports to AIDAB. These organisations themselves are also subject to periodic audit under their specific charters.
       </para>
       <para>
        A fuller outline of projects reporting processes, approval guidelines and summary of expenditure to June 1990 was given in my answer to a question from Senator Kemp on 27 November and also to question on notice No. 639 from Mr Cobb in the House of Representatives. While reports from NGOs have at times been delayed and have required follow-up by AIDAB in respect of points of detail, there have been no instances where payments have been continued in the absence of satisfactory reporting.

         —Yesterday Senator Coulter asked me about Indonesian nuclear reactor capacity. The short answer is as follows: The Indonesian Government has not yet made a decision on the type of reactor to be chosen for its proposed nuclear power program. It is our understanding that Indonesian authorities are engaged in discussions with nuclear reactor suppliers from the United States, Japan, Canada and France and have yet to begin a full feasibility study for the first reactor. Decisions on fuel for the reactor will clearly be made only once a reactor type is chosen. As to the enrichment of Australian uranium exports, they can only be enriched in countries with which Australia, as I said yesterday, has a bilateral safeguards agreement. Enrichment currently takes place in either the United States, France or the United Kingdom.

       As my question was about the completely improper payment that the Minister was responsible for making to a political party in South Africa, I find it highly offensive that he should imply that I would act in a way similar to him. It is important to place on the record that in no way, shape or form would I or anyone else on this side of the Parliament indulge in such behaviour. As I read the press release that Senator Evans had incorporated into the Hansard as part of his answer to me when he fully misrepresented me, he has, on any reading of that document, misrepresented points in it in two ways: firstly, nothing in the report by Professor Garnaut justifies--

        —Thank you, Mr President. I will keep my personal explanation as brief as I can. Senator Evans chose to say that $2m would be necessary to arrange an appointment for me to see such a person, whereas I only raised the sum of $83,000 as being a condition precedent. However, reading the South African program of assistance on economic policy and planning, which Senator Evans provided, I see that far more than $83,000 was paid; indeed, one could say that most of the $2m was provided, as there is an intent to equate the African National Congress (ANC) with the democratic movement. Indeed, at each and every stage it is the ANC which is involved with the expenditure of that money.

       I was making the strong point that far from there being a necessary payment of $2m to make an appointment for me to see anyone in a foreign nation, as it is necessary for the Minister, the justification that the Minister gives of Professor Garnaut's report somehow justifying the payment is totally without foundation in the document that he has tabled. I invite anyone to read the document as a complete negation of the answer the Minister gave, in which he thoroughly misrepresented my position.
      </para>
      <para>
       In making this personal explanation, I would say that I asked Senator Evans to table all advice that he had received to justify his payment. He evaded completely that part of my question whilst managing to misrepresent and insult both me and this side of the Parliament at the same time.

         —Last night we witnessed yet another act of economic vandalism perpetrated on every Australian by a scared little Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who has yet again shown he is totally incapable of keeping his word. On the strength of assurances from this discredited Prime Minister, the Coronation Hill Joint Venture proceeded to spend some $14m on exploration and feasibility studies with a view to developing a resource. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, which was then involved, in fact received a letter from Mr Hawke dated 9 October 1987 stating:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I can assure you that there has been no change in Government policy on the Conservation Zone concept or in relation to Coronation Hill.
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one told Brian Loton that the only way to deal with this Prime Minister was to line up Sir Peter Abeles and Bill Kelty as witnesses-and even then he does not keep his word.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just what is Coronation Hill? It is part of the buffer zone for the Kakadu National Park, described by Senator Evans-I am pleased to see him in the chamber-as `clapped out buffalo country'. It was previously mined by United Uranium in the 1950s and 1960s and some 25,000 to 35,000 tonnes of ore were extracted from the area. However, relying on the Prime Minister's written guarantee, the Coronation Hill Joint Venture went ahead and proved up deposits of gold, platinum and palladium.
       </para>
       <para>
        These reserves have the potential to employ some 200 people during the development phase and 200 to 250 Australians in the operational phase, of which at least 30 would have been Aboriginals from the Jawoyn race. Because of the flow-on multiplier effects, a further 175 jobs would have been generated elsewhere in the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Export or import replacement earnings would have been in the order of $62m per year, plus $43m generated from the multiplier effect. It is very sad that I have to stand here today and say `would have been', because that is past history. It is ironic that the platinum and palladium are used, among other things, to help cut car exhaust emissions and that Australia spends some $40m a year importing these metals from South Africa.
       </para>
       <para>
        Towards the end of 1989, this project and this long sorry saga which had satisfied all the environmental demands of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories was put on hold. Our discredited Prime Minister was not prepared to discuss the issue with the much respected Sir Arvi Parbo, but happily spent some 90 minutes on the phone with Phillip Toyne of the Australian Conservation Foundation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Richardson, the engineer behind this campaign, who is looking across the table will appreciate, this environmentally-approved, export-oriented project was put on hold for purely political purposes-the pending Federal election. This nation, suffering from the recession we had to have, was to be sacrificed to the green vote marshalled by Senator Richardson and Phillip Toyne.
       </para>
       <para>
        After the election, Coronation Hill was referred to the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC), although it was understood that there were no environmental constraints. The RAC discovered that the Australian Conservation Foundation-knowing that the environmental card was worthless-now concentrated attention on the Aboriginals who had previously supported mining. No-one will dispute that. It was claimed on their behalf that the area housed a spirit called Bula who, if disturbed, would bring catastrophe to the local area and perhaps to the universe. However, there is no conclusive evidence, as members of the Australian Labor Party would realise, of Bula's presence, and there was no suggestion of his presence until some five years ago.

       <para>
        In 1989, Senator Bob Collins, a humble backbencher at the time, but now a Minister in this Government, who was a party to this decision, accused those orchestrating this change of mind of being `consummate ratbags', acting against the long term interests of the Jawoyn community. They were the words of Senator Collins in 1989. I think that that is an apt description of the Labor Government itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surprise, surprise-what happened next? Our discredited agnostic Prime Minister found an escape route-a rat hole-which would enable him to reward the loony Left of his Party for saving his hide in the recent leadership challenge. What unmitigated hypocrisy! This person, who thumbed his nose at his own Christian principles and bragged in his biography of his religious disbeliefs, would now have us accept that he is a `born again Bula'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Make no mistake about it, this spineless Prime Minister could not care less about the Jawoyn people or Bula. He has not acted from integrity-he has proved over and over again that he has none. He has acted out of sheer and utter terror-terror of the socialist left; terror of the greenies; and, of primary concern to him, terror of the honourable member for Blaxland who is waiting to pounce, and pounce he will. The Prime Minister does not care about the Jawoyn and does not care about Australia. To his utter disgrace, he is simply using-or should I say abusing-the Jawoyn peoples as pawns in his little game. It is a disgrace.

        We have a recession in Australia which has been imposed upon the Australian people by this Hawke Labor Government. Every time the Hawke Labor Government pulls a political stunt like this, it consigns thousands of Australians to the unemployment scrap heap. It is not just a matter of people directly or indirectly missing out on employment at Coronation Hill; it is also a disincentive to investment in the only industry which can make a major contribution to lifting Australia out of the economic disaster inflicted upon us by this pusillanimous Prime Minister.

        Treasurer Kerin says that Coronation Hill has been blown out of proportion. Most people would have expected something better from John Kerin. He, of all people, knows of the damage to investor confidence that will follow this opportunistic decision. The Prime Minister's craven cowardice will cost Australia dearly. It will cost jobs; it will cost export income; and it will add to our import bill. Our foreign debt will continue to soar. The standard of living of every Australian will continue to decline. It is apparent that Treasurer Kerin, for whatever reason, has caught the Hawke disease. He is living proof that if one lies down with the dogs, one gets fleas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The losers are not the joint venture partners; they have competing sources of scarce resources. Regrettably, because of this decision, few of those sources in Australia will be attractive. The losers will be the Jawoyn people who are deprived by this decision of the opportunity to negotiate with the joint venturers-it has been cut off. This decision consigns those people to continued poverty. They will remain reliant on welfare, with little future and little hope for independence. The losers will be the people of the Northern Territory. The losers will be every Australian.

       <para>
        Coronation Hill joins a growing list of projects which have been torpedoed for political expediency. Because of the decisions on Coronation Hill and Wesley Vale and because of the crazy three-mine uranium policy, the cost to Australia is some $1,000m a year. This is the cost in respect of just those three areas. Is it any wonder that we are in the worst recession in 60 years? Because of the actions of this Government, there is no end in sight.
       </para>
       <para>
        I challenge people on the other side to tell me where this recovery will come from. All people in the Labor camp must be very proud indeed of the havoc and devastation they have wreaked on Australia-a country which should be prosperous but which, because of the Government's actions, is wallowing in the despair of a recession.

        The position of the Prime Minister on this issue and on a host of other issues going back decades which have involved Aboriginal people ought not to be put in question. Those opposite may attack the Prime Minister for all sorts of things, as indeed they can attack any of us. But the Prime Minister's record on the heritage and beliefs of Aboriginal people is first-class and goes back decades. It should be remembered that in the leadership challenge that occurred some weeks ago my close friend and colleague Senator Robert Ray was a very strong supporter of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is not a hostage of Senator Robert Ray, Senator Gareth Evans, anybody else who supported him, or the Left. The Prime Minister has shown time and time again on this issue that he is the hostage only of his own conscience. That is what all prime ministers ought to be.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of Coronation Hill, I note the opening phrase in Senator Parer's speech, which I think sums up the attitude of the coalition on this decision and a host of other decisions, and that is the phrase `economic vandalism'. At any time the Government takes a decision against any development, for whatever reason, we are considered to be economic vandals. The truth is that there is a host of reasons for decisions that are taken that will never satisfy the likes of Senator Parer or the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        For Senator Parer and the Opposition, the type of technology that would be used at a pulp mill at Wesley Vale is irrelevant. Whether or not organochlorins or anything else were to be pumped into Bass Strait is irrelevant. Senator Parer has no worry about that at all. But he must understand at some point that millions of Australians have that worry. One of the reasons that I know that is because Senator Parer is sitting opposite and I am sitting here. Millions of Australians have that concern. If one takes Wesley Vale as an example-and Senator Parer raised it today-the very same people who walked away from Wesley Vale because they could not abide the Commonwealth guidelines are now queuing up to do it again under those same guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The truth is that the Government had at the time set up some tough guidelines. Australians believe and are entitled to know that the Government did not walk away from them on that occasion and will not in the future. But the really offensive part of Senator Parer's contribution was this business about there being no conclusive evidence of Bula's presence and their having no idea of him until five years ago.

         —They are Senator Parer's words. I refer to the report of the Resource Assessment Commission which examined this issue under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Stewart. It is quite obvious that Senator Parer has not read it. It never takes long in times like these for reactionaries to crawl out from under every rock in the country. My God, the rocks have been emptied this morning and again this afternoon in the Senate! We had Marshall Perron this morning dismissing any Aboriginal beliefs in Bula in the region as `superstitious mumbo jumbo'. While we have not had much colour from Senator Parer-and that figures-we have got this phrase `no conclusive evidence of Bula's presence'.

        I quote from the second reading debate on the Bill to set up the Resource Assessment Commission. The then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, said:

        That is what he said and that is exactly what has happened. The problem for Senator Parer is that it did not go the way he wanted it. There are two passages in Justice Stewart's report that I think dispel this nonsense on Bula which Senator Parer was parroting about today. The first passage says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of whether the Bula tradition is a living religion or an archaeological relic is ultimately subjective. The evidence presented to the inquiry and confirmed by the inquiry's consultants confirms that Bula ceremonies are no longer performed. But the beliefs are still widely held. Men still sing some associated songs. Restrictions continue to be placed within and around Bula sites and those who believe in Bula still feel the consequences of disturbing him. In the minds of many Jawoyn people the Bula cult is a living religious belief.

        I note the interjections of Senator Crichton-Browne on Merlan and the consultants. I will have something to say about that later on, because he is not the first person to attack the consultants, and he is not the first to have his allegations about them and their objectivity smashed. What Mr Justice Stewart says in section 761 of the report is interesting in relation to the five years of Senator Parer. He says:

        There is no doubt that it was well established and known in detail by senior Jawoyn Aboriginal people over four decades ago. It is obviously not a modern invention and many contemporary Jawoyn people hold a sincere belief in its power.

       <para>
        The concepts of the `sickness country' and multiple Bula sites occur in the first anthropological records of the area, which date back to the early fifties. By the early eighties Bula's presence and influence is recorded by anthropological observers as connecting focal sites by a network of sensory links. Coronation Hill, known to the Jawoyn as Garatba, is part of the Bula tradition.

        At 7128, Justice Stewart says:

        Whatever the combinations of reasons and influences might be, it is clear to the inquiry that the custodians regard Garatba as being associated with Bula and as containing the essence of Bula.

        There is the answer to the `What about Coronation Hill?' interjection of Senator Parer. After a very lengthy, painstaking examination of Aboriginal traditions and beliefs, that is what Justice Stewart and his commissioners had to say. Senator Parer's problem is that it does not accord with his predetermined views.

         —`Prejudices' is certainly a far better word to use in this context. However, in looking at the reports by consultants on the anthropological aspects of this, the mining industry did much to trumpet a report by Dr Brunton. We were told that this was the report that we had to take notice of. There are two things to say about that. Firstly, while Dr Brunton may have an excellent track record in Melanesia, in looking at kava use and so on, one wonders about his expertise in looking at the Jawoyn or the Aboriginals of northern Australia.

The problem is that every time an independent expert looks at this, Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Parer think he is wrong. The kind of high quality research into the environmental, economic and cultural issues that we are talking about here, which were examined in this inquiry, must be taken into account.

        From an environmental point of view, I had always had the concern that there may have been environmental damage, particularly if other mines in the Coronation Hill conservation zone area were to go ahead. But it is obvious from the attitude of the companies in recent times that El Sharana did not turn out to be what they had hoped and that the pressure that would have been on the tailings dams at Coronation Hill from an additional very large mine simply would not exist. So the idea that the conservation zone should go into the park is not locking up a whole lot of sites, a whole lot of potential mines; it is locking up one. When we try to work out what this one site is worth, what we are saying--

It could perhaps, at full capacity in several years time, contribute something like one per cent of Australia's gold production-not some great bulk of production in Australia but only a tiny bit. The mining companies placed an advertisement in the newspapers the other day that suggested that the Prime Minister should not make a $38 billion mistake. There were those of us who scratched our heads and tried to work out how Coronation Hill was going to be worth $38 billion.

The idea that in some way the whole of the mining industry in Australia is at risk because one decision is taken about one much smaller mine leaves me a bit cold. But the RAC has said that the direct net benefit of the Coronation Hill mine to the Australian economy is $82m. Furthermore, if mining had proceeded in accordance with the guidelines that were put up by the RAC, that benefit would have been reduced to an estimated value of $64m, which figure was arrived at by the Australian Bureau for Agricultural and Resource Economics. So the kind of money we are talking about here goes nowhere near the billion dollar figures that are bandied around in this debate.

        Even this morning on commercial radio, according to the first report, the mining industry put the figure at $500m. By the time we got to the third news report, the figure was $10 billion. What the mining industry is doing on this occasion-and it is quite dangerous-is to hugely exaggerate the value of what would have been one relatively small goldmine, and that ought not to be done. When one considers the value of this area to the heritage of the local Aborigines-and I have quoted at length from what real independent experts have had to say about it-I do not think we can put a price on those beliefs. When I look at one of the great national treasures of Australia in Kakadu, I do not want to see it wrecked and ruined by the greed of anyone and, in particular, of Senator Parer and those opposite.

         —The Australian Democrats strongly welcome the decision which the Government has made. Although we have some reservations about the reasons which lie behind that, we do not in any way question the sincerity of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to his concern about Aboriginal beliefs. I would here and now totally dissociate the Democrats from the derision which Senator Parer a moment ago sought to heap upon the beliefs of some of the original Australians and which one of his former colleagues, Senator Stone, did in an article in the Australian Financial Review a few weeks ago.

        Three separate matters are at issue here: the exploitation of a non-renewable resource, the mining in a natural area in relation to a national park, and the exploitation of a site of cultural and religious significance to the Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the first matter-the exploitation of a non-renewable resource-nothing indicates more vividly than the discussion which has surrounded this decision the fundamental flaw which lies at the basis of economic analysis of resource exploitation being carried on by the Government, the Opposition and, indeed, by most economic journalists in this country. This concerns the way in which the accounting methods fail to recognise the real world and have led, and continue to lead, to wrong conclusions about the benefits of resource exploitation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Every company accountant knows that companies keep a capital and a cash flow account. Capital must be maintained or, to use the in term, sustainable. If expended, it appears in the accounts as a transfer from the capital to the cash flow account. Nationally, however, economists have developed a measure of cash flow-it is called the gross domestic product (GDP)-but have never developed a national capital account.
       </para>
       <para>
        The economists' view of the world is one of infinite resources and, therefore, one in which it is unnecessary to keep national capital accounts. Essentially, according to this view, resources are indefinitely and infinitely renewable and/or there is no such thing as a non-renewable resource. This is the basis of the Government's and the Opposition's economic analysis. It does not accord with the real world and it does not accord with the most fundamental law of science-the second law of thermodynamics.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proper national accounting would recognise that there is no such thing as developing a resource. This false notion is analogous to saying, `You are developing your bank account by taking money out of it'. In the case of Coronation Hill, the gold, platinum and palladium are capital assets. They will remain there as capital assets as long as they are not exploited. I use the word `exploited' repeatedly rather than the word `developed' for the reasons that I have just indicated.

If, in 50 years time, our grandchildren find an overwhelming need for these resources, they will still be there, probably even more precious than today. We cannot develop these resources, we can merely exploit them or transfer their value from the non-existent national capital account to the cash flow account or to the GDP. I interpolate here that Senator Parer mentioned earlier the exploitation which had already occurred at Coronation Hill, yet we find this country going down the gurgler. So much for the benefit which flows from exploiting non-renewable resources.

       <para>
        The absence of a national capital account gives us the illusion-and I stress that word-of becoming more wealthy by exploiting these and other non-renewable resources. It is an illusion; it is a trick of the defective method of accounting which we practise which, in turn, is based on a falsehood in relation to our perceptions of the real world.

        Secondly, Coronation Hill sits within the catchment area of the Alligator River system. It is upstream of the important wetlands of the existing Kakadu World Heritage area. The conservation movement has correctly held for many years that, in setting areas aside, natural boundaries such as catchment limits rather than arbitrary lines on maps should be used. Accordingly, it is argued that the whole of the Alligator River system should be within the Kakadu National Park.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although I said I would resist assessment of value of natural areas based entirely on dollar values, real or imputed, from what I have already said such exercises should be a part of a comprehensive and realistic system of national economic accounting. The totality of the values of Kakadu are represented in the decision to declare it a World Heritage area. Part of this totality, and part only, can be represented in dollar terms. As such, damage to this dollar value would be shown in my suggested proper national accounting system as a debit against the claimed benefits of exploitation. An attempt to do this was made by the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC).
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think the RAC would claim its dollar assessment was a comprehensive one of all values or that its methodology was not open to criticism. Nonetheless the attempt to place a dollar value on certain aspects was correct, as is the implication of that exercise that if one is to exploit a non-renewable resource within environmentally sensitive areas, these assessed costs, the costs of environmental damage, must be offset against any claimed benefits. As everyone knows, that process very substantially reduces still further any claimed benefit from exploiting this non-renewable resource. Thus a proper accounting of the costs and benefits of mining Coronation Hill would show that the value of the resource was not gained by the act of exploitation but merely transferred from capital to cash flow and that in the process environmental costs were borne which together show that the act of exploiting this resource-and again I stress the words `exploiting this resource'-produces no benefit at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, there is the matter of the mining and its considerable impact on the cultural and religious significance of the Jawoyn people. Very briefly, I say that here we totally dissociate ourselves from the lack of respect which has been shown by members and former members of the Opposition with regard to Aboriginal beliefs. We welcome at long last the fact that the Government has given some official recognition to the legitimacy of those beliefs and, in so doing, is seeking to protect the area of Coronation Hill.

        It is absolutely appropriate that Coronation Hill should be returned to Kakadu National Park and subsequently included in the World Heritage area. It is an absolutely right decision on two grounds-both cultural and environmental. While I support the Jawoyn people in their spiritual attachment to the area, and I am delighted at the outcome on their behalf, it must also be acknowledged that on environmental grounds alone, and quite separately, Coronation Hill should have been returned to Kakadu because it is an ecologically sensitive area and should not be subject to mining. The South Alligator River system would have been subject to contamination had mining been allowed, and this of course could have affected the entire wetlands system, the fundamental asset of Kakadu.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contrary to some statements which have been made about the decision, the Resource Assessment Commission clearly questioned both the likely environmental and cultural effects of mining within the conservation zone. These factors were weighed up against the net benefit to the country from mining which was assessed by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to be $63m. I believe that the mining industry should be charged under the Trade Practices Act for misleading advertising in relation to the outrageous claims it has been making. The mining industry should be wary of trying to portray this as a test case for all mining projects. Rather than trying to discredit the process by which the decision was made, the mining industry should learn from it and accept that even in hard economic times the community wants respect shown for social and environmental values.

Far more qualified researchers in work published over a period of twenty years failed to record or support any of the claims now being made by Cooper and Josif. Based on its consultations with its nominated custodians and in accord with their (recorded) instructions the ASSPA has in fact given a number of formal approvals for work to be carried out on Coronation Hill. Only one nominated custodian, Peter Jatbula, has ever had any consistent reservations about work on the area. All other nominated custodians and senior Jawoyn leaders have expressed support for the proposal.

         —I thank the Senate. I want to touch on one other matter that was raised by Senator Richardson. I am not questioning Dr Francesca Merlan's integrity. I am questioning the compromising situation she has been put in. She was responsible when working for the Jawoyn people to identify and have sacred sites registered. She then worked for the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority checking the validity of her own work. Then she worked for the Northern Territory Land Council when it was debating the question of whether the Aboriginal community was entitled to a land claim. If that is not compromising, I do not know what it is, Senator Vallentine. I regret that I have only five minutes in which to complete my speech. I think it is absolutely impossible to get any sort of responsible judgments made as a result of those matters.

        Can I just quickly go to a number of other matters. Firstly, I refer to a document that was prepared by Senator Collins himself. I want to go to this question of whether or not the Aboriginal community support mining. Senator Collins said:

        It is acknowledged that Nipper Brown is the only person still alive who has attended what appears to have been the last Bula ceremony. He attended that ceremony as a boy of fifteen in about 1940. All evidence indicates that it has never been performed since. On his own evidence Nipper has no personal knowledge now of any of the Bula songs or ceremony and all other persons related to that ceremony are now dead.

        When I asked whether there are any custodians who do object, he said, `Few'. I asked, `What about the majority?'. He said that they have no objection to mining on Coronation Hill. It is not without significance to note that the application to make Coronation Hill a sacred site was allegedly signed by Nipper Brown, Sandy Barraway and Peter Jatbula. I asked those people individually, `Have you ever or do you ever remember signing an application form for Coronation Hill to be a sacred site?' They replied, `No. Never. Nothing. It is free'.

        The irrefutable evidence, which was given under oath by the custodians, the Jawoyn people, is categorically, without qualification, that they do not believe it is a site of significance, a sacred site or a site that presents any barrier or bar to mining; yet we now have the Prime Minister telling Australia that we shall not have mining at Coronation Hill because of the concerns of Aboriginal people. He knows that the truth is that it is a phoney excuse. Senator Collins has been asked on numerous occasions whether he supports mining on Coronation Hill. I do not have time to quote from what he has said, but his answer has been, `Yes, without question'.

        The truth of the matter is that this Government finds itself seeking to prop up a failed and failing Prime Minister. The price that this country has to pay for this is $500m of export earnings simply to keep Bob Hawke in The Lodge. This has nothing to do with realities, economic decisions, the Jawoyn people or the environment; it is all to do with keeping Bob Hawke in his job. As Senator Graham Richardson himself said in Cabinet last night, `We have to go along with you to save you. Don't you know that the vote is 12 : 8 against you? The truth of the matter is that we will stick with you, even though it is a wrong decision, simply because we cannot afford to damage you any more and roll you. Therefore, we will compromise ourselves, this country, the taxpayers, the company and vote in a way which we know is an aberration of reality and truth'. Is it not sad--

         —I just want to speak very briefly in this debate and, in doing so, I wish to put the record straight with respect to a number of points that have so far been made. I am glad that Senator Crichton-Browne is here at the moment. He asked me a question yesterday on the Jawoyn people's approval of exploration and mining in some other parts of their territory. The inference of the question was that in their agreements they had agreed to mine on sickness country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I refer Senator Crichton-Browne to a press statement put out yesterday, I believe, by Poseidon Exploration Ltd and the Northern Land Council. They put out this press statement in order to clarify `a misunderstanding that appears to have surfaced regarding exploration licence applications in south-west Arnhem Land'. The statement, which is essentially one paragraph, reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        The terms and conditions of the proposed exploration agreement between the Northern Land Council and the joint venture involving Poseidon Exploration Ltd preclude exploration on any area of exploration licence 6354 which may fall within what is known as the sickness country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put that on the record. It is a statement from both the exploration company and the Northern Land Council. No matter how much the Opposition wants to maintain a framework of misinformation and disinformation on this, there are some undisputable facts about this debate. The real task of government is to make decisions.

         —The basic thing we must remember about the area we are talking about is that Coronation Hill is a registered sacred site under Northern Territory legislation. It has been so registered since October 1985. There are also within that conservation zone area a number of other registered sacred sites. In addition, there has been an application to register the sickness country as a sacred site.

        The first point I make is that we have this degree of disinformation, but also ignorance, on the part of the Opposition with respect to the latter point on the sickness country. It is stated that it is only a recent invention and that it has only been in the last five or 10 years that the sickness country has evolved as a concept. To highlight that degree of ignorance, we have the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, saying on 17 May:
       </para>
       <para>
        But if you know anything about Aboriginal heritage, Bula didn't exist 10 years ago.
       </para>

        No more ignorant a statement could be made on the issues involved than Dr Hewson's statement. It shows once again that he lacks the capacity, the intelligence and the application to become a successful leader in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The basic point is that as long ago as 1962 the concept of sickness country in this area was recognised. It is documented and it has been recognised by the Stewart report. That cannot be denied.

         —I make the point that the concept of sickness country has been established for a long time. But I also make the point that for the last 45 years or so, anthropological evidence has been documented and white people have written about the Jawoyn people and their belief in Bula. Over that period there has been one consistent factor and that is a recognition of sacred sites within that conservation zone area. To provide evidence for that, I will quote what Justice Stewart says in his Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) final report at 7126, because there is nothing more definite than what he says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bula tradition is not a modern invention. The concepts of the Sickness Country and multiple Bula sites occur in the first anthropological records of the area, which date back to the early 1950s. Subsequent records are scant, but persistent. By the early 1980s Bula's presence and influence is recorded by anthropological observers as connecting focal sites by a network of sensory links and as having spheres of influence of up to 10 kilometres around important Bula sites.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other thing one cannot deny in relation to the conservation zone is that it is littered with archaeological sites of-to use the jargon of the trade-top cohort quality. There is no doubt in the eyes of the independent assessor, Mr Justice Stewart, that what we do have here is not only a sacred site but also sickness country and, as a consequence, the conservation zone is a sacred site. That is in his report. We also indisputably have the fact that the belief in Bula has been documented, acknowledged and respected for more than four decades.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the law of this country does and what the law of country has been recognised and respected internationally as doing, is to recognise that the basic part of Aboriginal religion is its interwoven links with the land. There are a whole host of quotes I can go to in terms of the importance of that link with the land. Their religion lies in their land. We cannot in this place say to them, as others have tried to say, that we just do not believe that this concept is real. There is nothing more patronising than that, nothing more paternalistic and nothing more discriminatory.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find the points of view that have been put forward by the mining industry extremely offensive. Mr Quinn, who sees himself as some sort of cavalier in this particular issue, with what is nothing more than a paternalistic and arrogant attitude stated on 13 May:
       </para>
       <para>
        If Aboriginals and their culture are to survive they must come to terms with the twentieth century.
       </para>
       <para>
        One just cannot dictate to people what they should do with their religion. White people's religions evolve and change but there are some basic precepts and beliefs that have not changed to accommodate the twentieth century. Why should we demand of this group of people that they conform to white man's law and white man's religion?
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes even further than that. The degree of disregard for these people and their rights is just astounding. For what reason? What is at stake here? What we are being asked to sell out is Aboriginal religion. We are asked to do it for the price of one packet of cigarettes per Australian. That is all we are on about. Justice Stewart, an independent arbitrator, was asked by the Government under legislation passed by this place to inquire into the validity of the Aboriginal beliefs and the need or otherwise to protect them. He makes the point very clear in an economic assessment based on the practice of economists from the Industry Commission across the board. He goes to the net present value and the net present value of the mine was documented by him at $82m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once we take out of that figure the cost of monitoring and the other costs that would have to be involved in back filling, which would have had to be incurred by the joint venture, the price goes down to $63.9m, with a net return to the mining company of $14.4m. It is less than the price of a packet of cigarettes per head of the Australian population. We have been asked to sell out what these people believe in for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government is not going to be stood over by fallacious arguments, by mythology and by the sorts of fabrications and ignorance that are perpetuated on the other side. We are on this side of the chamber because we make rational assessments. In coming to our assessment on this issue, we took into account the threat of a capital strike. Two or three years ago everyone in this place talked about how international capital would flow out of Australia because of our deferral of this particular decision. A couple of things have changed over the last few years. In respect of this mine, the joint venture structure, there has not been a flood of capital out of the country. There has been a 23 per cent increase in foreign interest in this particular venture. If there is a buck to be made the mining companies will make it, and good luck to them. Let us not deny that. The assertion that we are threatened with a $38 billion disaster, as has been put forward in the newspapers recently, is fallacious, intimidatory and dictatorial. The mining company took its case to Justice Stewart. It had it assessed and re-assessed and it was rejected. CRA Ltd is on the record and documented in paragraph 6.43 of the RAC report as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        If a mineral exploration company chooses to explore an area which has high conservation-or other-values, it does so in the knowledge that finding a mineral deposit will not mean that it can expect automatic approval to develop a deposit. A company has to be prepared to bear that risk. If it fails to get approval, the company sustains the loss-not the public.
       </para>
       <para>
        So be it. This Government was not prepared to set aside these people's beliefs for the price of a packet of cigarettes. We are proud of this decision. It will go down as one of the best decisions that this Government has taken. It highlights the difference between those on the Government side of the chamber and those on the other side. Those opposite are concerned about dollars and cents. We are also, but we are concerned about people and their beliefs as well.

         —Senator Parer's matter of public importance focuses on three points: firstly, the price we have had to pay for the hostage of the Left by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke); secondly, the broken promises of the Prime Minister that will cost the nation millions of dollars and thousands of jobs; and, thirdly, the fact that the Prime Minister is destroying opportunities for the Jawoyn people. Consider how yesterday's Cabinet meeting was written up in the Age this morning:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Bordering on tears, Mr Hawke made a highly emotional speech to ministers, accusing the mining companies of supremist attitudes and said no one could question his integrity on Aboriginal issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . Senator Richardson, declared during the meeting that Mr Hawke obviously did not have the numbers. But it was important that the Prime Minister's position was carried because he had publicly declared his attitude on Monday.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister won not on the arguments but because his Ministers could not afford to dump him. What a load of opportunism and lost opportunities for Australia. The conniving between so many different groups and people who have worked on this is absolutely phenomenal to consider. The consequences to the economy and to the Northern Territory need to be considered: $500m in today's dollars; 180 direct jobs and 150 indirect jobs, plus, of course, the operating expenditure for fuels, services and supplies that would flow on everywhere; and an increase in Northern Territory employment of at least 3 per cent. They are important issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other speakers today have focused on some of the Aboriginal issues. In no way do I share the patronising attitudes of so many of these people. Aboriginal culture is not static; it is flexible and it is capable of change. We do not have to cocoon people into the nineteenth century. It is very important that Aborigines can reconcile mining with spirituality. We should look at Ranger, Gove and Groote Eylandt. People and cultures do change, and this was pointed out in the Resource Assessment Commission report. The Prime Minister's stance has now jeopardised the potential for hundreds of other projects and joint ventures for many Aborigines throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In effect, they are trying to bypass so many other areas. What about the Constitution of Australia? Section 116 states:
       </para>

        The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

        The Prime Minister has shown that he is very capable of cheating, lying, scheming, compromising and ratting on his words and commitments; he has done so over and over again. For example, in this decision he relied on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Interim Protection Act. Let us go back to the second reading speech of that Act and what the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Holding, said when introducing it in 1984. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I must make it clear from the outset that this is not interim land rights legislation nor is it intended to be an alternative to land claim procedures. I will not be making declarations with respect to vast areas of land in de facto recognition of a claim which Aboriginals may wish to make later under another law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, he said:

        In practice the Commonwealth sees this as legislation to be used as a last resort.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the commitment that the Government made and the Prime Minister has now broken. What did the Prime Minister, Mr Kerin and Senator Richardson say when the Resource Assessment Commission was established? They said that the Commission would be established not to look into individual projects but to concern itself with broad policy-making on industry matters. Out of the window-not considered. Instead: get in and focus on just doing the bidding of the Prime Minister-how to achieve it-and come back to rely totally on his particular area.

        The Conservation Foundation of Australia has shown itself to be both opportunistic and cynical. One only has to look at the press statement it put out yesterday with regard to how it sees the hidden agenda as being the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Federal Conference in Hobart next week to see that. The Conservation Foundation wants to put the ALP under intense pressure to oppose the freeing up of uranium mining and this decision is importantly linked to that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision goes against a majority of economic Ministers in the Cabinet. We know that; it has been quite public. Hawke had to cry his way out of this one. Perhaps the opportunism of the ALP was best illustrated in the quote from Senator Collins which I used here several weeks ago, `A Greenie in the hand is worth two gold bars in the bush'. Senator Collins came into this chamber and acknowledged that he had made that statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, Senator Collins, as President of the ALP in the Northern Territory and as a Northern Territory senator, has been sold down the drain on this issue and totally compromised. It is the lost opportunities for jobs and boosts to the Northern Territory and the national economy that are important. Unfortunately, Senator Collins has failed on these counts just as much as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and Senator Bolkus from the Left, who have screwed the Prime Minister to the wall and thrown every bit of punching bag that they could to weasel this decision out of him, have failed. It is against the national interests, the interests of future generations of Australians and, in particular, the Jawoyn and other Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.

         —I asked that this matter be adjourned this morning to enable a chance for consultation to take place-the consultation that did not happen before the altered proposed reference of this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I re-emphasise that we have a system of eight standing committees, to each of which particular portfolios of government administration have been allocated. Issues concerning the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are relevant to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Anything in that area-whether it be related to the Department, a statutory authority or any other body associated with that portfolio-ought, by definition, to be dealt with by that Committee. It is the only sensible and efficient way of dealing with things. If there is a reason for something to be referred to a committee, I suggest that it ought to go to the appropriate committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main part of the motion proposed by Senator Hill is about whether the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is fulfilling its role to protect and advance Australia's foreign policy interests, and then it adds on four items that the Department should particularly have regard to. Frankly, I find it embarrassing as the Chair of the Finance and Public Administration Committee-which has Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, and Finance portfolios within its responsibilities-to deal with foreign affairs and trade, which colleagues in another committee have the main expertise and interest in and who ought to have the relationship with the Department and other agencies. I believe very strongly that if there is something in this area to be referred to a committee, then it ought to be referred to the relevant committee and there ought to be no doubt about which is the relevant committee on this occasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        This morning Senator Evans gave some very cogent reasons about why there was no need at all to refer the matter to a committee. His arguments were very convincing to me, but I am happy to leave him to have made those arguments. I merely want to make sure that, if there is to be such a reference, it be to the appropriate committee. In any case, I have circulated in the chamber an amendment which I propose to move to seek to modify Senator Hill's motion to recognise that the Senate has already set up a procedure for investigating and monitoring the activities and operations of departments and agencies of the Government. That is the process of formal referral of annual reports of departments and other bodies to committees for their consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        When committees get those reports, they can look at them in a variety of ways. One of those ways can be to have a public hearing and to call officers before the committee to examine particular aspects of the annual report or to focus on parts of the annual report that bring up issues of interest, such as items (a), (b), (c) and (d) in Senate Hill's motion. So the process is already there. That sort of thing could happen when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade annual report is tabled sometime after 30 June, in any case. If the Senate wishes to give some guidance to a committee as to the extent of its examination of a particular annual report, let that be as well. That is what I am suggesting we should do in this case. I move:
       </para>
       <para>
        Omit ``the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for inquiry and report:'', substitute: ``when the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade considers the 1990-91 annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in accordance with the resolution of the Senate of 14 December 1989, it pay particular attention to:''.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remainder of Senator Hill's motion would stand, setting out the sorts of things that he wishes the Committee to look at. I see no problem with that happening within the program of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade if its members wish and, as is suggested by Senator Hill, to have a public hearing, call in the relevant officers, and even go to the extent of advertising for submissions. Senator Hill ought to acknowledge that there should be some credence given to the ability of a committee to run its program of hearings and to mesh in this particular proposal with its other work. That, of course, can quite easily be done under the referral of annual reports procedures, as I suggest.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have to emphasise, as I did this morning, the issue of the workload of both the Finance and Public Administration Committee and the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. I am speaking here of not just the workload of committee members themselves but also of the committee secretariats which work particularly hard looking at annual reports, dealing with Bills referred to their committees and handling major references which are already part of their responsibilities and which have been given to them by the Senate. The Finance and Public Administration Committee, for instance, is in the midst of a major inquiry into the Ombudsman and that inquiry ought to have priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        In earlier years, I can recall being in a situation where the Committee was absolutely and totally overloaded with work. This meant that it was not possible for any of us to do with any degree of satisfaction any of the jobs that had been given to us. I certainly do not want to get back into the position of feeling that the whole operation of the Committee was out of control because far too much work was loaded onto us. I guess I speak on behalf of Senator Maguire, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, in suggesting that the load of that Committee is also high. It already has major references before it.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I urge the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to give serious consideration to supporting my amendment, which I believe is a very sensible attempt to acknowledge the sorts of things that Senator Hill wants to have examined by the Finance and Public Administration Committee but, at the same time, recognises the existing processes and does not seek to load additional work onto the wrong committee.

         —The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has built up a strong reputation for the evaluation of administrative performance. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Senate has shown its confidence in this Committee's ability to conduct an investigation into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I am not surprised to find opposition from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, given the wide range of very critical Auditor-General's comments that have been directed at this Department. In fact, I remind the Senate that at a recent conference in Darwin, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was castigated by David Shand-a former Department of Finance officer who is now working for the Queensland Government-for not pursuing a number of concerns.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I will give one example as a background to the need for such an inquiry. Ten million dollars was expended by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on an overseas accounting system which was undertaken contrary to the advice given to the Department. This $10m project was subsequently abandoned without trace. This is just not good enough. It is a not good enough discharge of responsibility by a major department of state to expend such a large amount of money contrary to advice and then abandon it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the Senate's attention to a wide number of Australian National Audit Office reports on this Department, all of which were critical. Since the major inquiry of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman is drawing to a conclusion, I believe that the planning schedule should enable the Committee to accommodate the reference, although I admit it may be desirable to second the services of an officer from an area such as the executive development scheme or from the Department of the Parliamentary Library in order that the reasonably heavy legislative program evaluations, in the number of references of Bills to the Finance and Public Administration Committee, are not impeded.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coates mentioned that the process could be accommodated within the framework of committee appraisals of annual reports processes. The issues that have been put before the Senate are far greater than the coverage envisaged within that evaluation. I have spoken to my Opposition colleagues who served with me on the Committee and they are happy to pursue that inquiry. At the same time, they reject the amendment that is currently before the Senate. We therefore have great pleasure in endorsing the original motion moved by our leader, Senator Hill, who has great expertise in the area of foreign affairs and whose concerns are reflected in this motion.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate that Opposition senators are used to hard work. We are keen to fulfil the wishes of the Senate and, in doing so, to discharge in a proper and professional manner our own senatorial responsibilities.

         —I will be brief, but I think there are some important questions about the manner in which legislative and general purpose committees should operate and the priorities which should be set that relate to this matter. I want to make some general points about that and some specific points about this motion in supporting Senator Coates's amendment. I will not go to the general questions addressed in the motion about the overall merits of having such an inquiry. They have been adequately addressed by Senator Gareth Evans, and the arithmetic of his cogent arguments is clear, so I will not waste the time of the Senate on that, as we are all busy.

       <para>
        I want to make one comment about why I believe Senator Coates is correct and that it is more appropriate that this should go to the legislative and general purpose committee relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I believe that one of the very important things we should be seeking to have those committees do is develop a more comprehensive and effective familiarity with all the activities and functions of the departments for which they have policy responsibility-in this case, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many references I could refer to, but let me quote from pages 66 and 67 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-a very appropriate authority in this particular debate-when it reported on Estimates committee documentation and procedures. The report said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is widely agreed that the Senate standing legislative and general purpose committees have some responsibility for review of the performance of agencies. This responsibility was given additional weight by a resolution of the Senate of 14 December 1989 requiring the standing committees to review all annual reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee believes that the Senate's resolution on annual reports acknowledges a need for the standing committees to be more systematic in their review of the performance of public agencies.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the general principle. There is a lot that could be said about it but, in the time available, essentially that is the first point that I want to put on the record. Secondly, this matter raises four specific points with regard to the procedures and operations of the Department; but all of those are particular subparts of a reference with regard to whether that Department is fulfilling its role to protect and advance Australia's foreign policy interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is only one committee given the responsibility by this Senate to look at whether particular activities of any aspect of government, Australian society or broader issues relate to the protection and advancement of Australia's foreign policy interests, and obviously that is the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. To illustrate that, I remind the Senate of two similar inquiries that have been conducted into the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, subparts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They were conducted by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-comprehensively and adequately, as they should have been. The general principle about where this should go, the specific point, as it relates to this report, and the precedents all indicate that Senator Coates's amendment is the superior proposal before us.

         —I rise to support the motion which has been moved by Senator Hill; therefore, I find it very hard to support the amendment which Senator Coates has moved. I will briefly comment on the background to Senator Coates's amendment. It seems to me that there is a disposition in the Senate that there should be a comprehensive review of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The question is whether that investigation should be carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration or the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Basically, this Senate is asking for a comprehensive review. In my view, the comprehensive review would involve the same amount of time-and, presumably, the same amount of work-by either Committee.

        The device of Senator Coates's amendment to use the annual report to try to swing this back to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs is just that-a device; because, in reality, if the wishes of the Senate are adhered to, there will have to be a very comprehensive review by either Committee. Senator Coates has drawn our attention to the fact that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also has a very busy program. He mentioned that that was the view of Senator Maguire, the Chairman of that Committee. We take that on board.

        Senator Coates was quite right to draw to the attention of the chamber that our own Committee also has a heavy program. As a member of that Committee with Senator Coates, I do not shirk from the responsibility involved in standing committee work. I assure Senator Coates-and I am sure that my colleagues will do this-that we would be more than happy to make the time available to ensure that a comprehensive inquiry into this is carried out.

         —I wish briefly to address the amendment moved by Senator Coates and then close the debate by responding to a few of the matters raised by Senator Evans this morning. I did not speak in the debate this morning because in December, when I first put this motion down, I put with it the reasons for the proposed reference and I therefore believe it unwise, within the time constraints of the last few days of this session, for me to repeat those matters. It seems to me that two issues arise out of Senator Coates's amendment. The first is the question of the more appropriate committee to take this task upon itself, and the second is the means by which Senator Coates is seeking to restructure the reference under the head of an examination of the annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)-and I will deal with both of those matters.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If I can deal with the question of the more appropriate committee first, I have to accept that that matter is arguable. I could not but do that, seeing that when I put the motion down in December of last year I was in fact suggesting that it go to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. However, it seems to me on reflection that, on balance, the reference, particularly in its amended form which moves it away from specific allegations of malpractice and financial irregularity within the Department, and the matters that are or would be the subject of the inquiry, are more appropriate to the Committee on Finance and Public Administration rather than relating specifically to foreign affairs issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I look around to see my colleague Senator Watson and consider his particular skills and record, I would have to say, without any disrespect to anyone else in the chamber, the key part of this reference being aspects of the management systems and program evaluation procedures within the Department, that I cannot think of a more appropriate person to be addressing those very important issues. On balance, it seemed to me that the more appropriate committee was the one with the skills and expertise to deal with these general issues of departmental structure and the type of systems that can best meet efficiency requirements. Therefore, I settled for the department which is in the terms of my amendment earlier today, rather than the portfolio Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also the issue of the attempt to change the reference to deal with it under the head of an annual report, and I have to say to Senator Coates that I think that would be inappropriate also. References to and considerations of annual reports have been limited to the year in question covered by the annual report and, in my experience anyway, matters that have arisen out of the annual report. What we are concerned with in this inquiry is an ongoing series of difficulties within the Department that do not relate just to this year. The questions of the shortcomings of the systems that have allowed financial irregularities for a long time have been around well beyond the year in question. The problem arising from the lack of or inadequate security mechanisms with documents and the international embarrassment that has been caused to Australia as a result goes well beyond the year in question. Therefore, attempting to amend the reference to deal with it under the head of an annual report seems to me to be inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not want Senator Coates to believe that we are, therefore, of the opinion that every other reference that deals with matters arising out of the management of a department should also go to his Committee. Several notices of motion were given by the Australian Democrats this morning that will obviously have to be addressed carefully and the same test applied to them as I have sought to apply to this one. One notice of motion moved this morning dealt in particular with FM radio questions. It might be that that matter is more appropriate for a specific committee other than his, but I am not giving a commitment now because it has to go through the full party procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only other point I make in addressing Senator Coates's speech this morning is that whilst I do not know that I need a lecture on courtesy from him, I do appreciate that I should have informed him last night. I regret that I did not. I plead simply the pressure of business. Therefore, we will not support the amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will deal briefly with the matters that were raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, that go to the substance of the issue. The Minister should not be afraid of parliamentary scrutiny as he seemed to be this morning. I also say that the capacity to inquire within the structure of Estimates committees is somewhat limited. The issues that we are seeking to pursue within this inquiry are really inappropriate to the Estimates committee mechanism.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, the decision to seek the reference has in part come from our experience of being unable to get to the bottom of the issues that concern the management systems within the Department. There is the inability of the Department to formulate proper program evaluation procedures that deal with the Estimates Committee being unable to get to the bottom of why these leaks of sensitive information are continuing, despite the Minister's assurances that everything possible is being done. It is these failures of the Estimates Committee to produce the answers that we require that, in part, has led us to believe that the only way to get to the bottom of these issues is by a more in-depth inquiry, and that the appropriate mechanism for that is a standing committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that extensive financial irregularities have been disclosed within the Department for some time. I am pleased to say that it seems that those that have been disclosed have now been largely answered. What we do not know is whether the Department's systems have now been changed in a way that will avoid a repetition of that embarrassment. That is the sort of inquiry that could be undertaken by this Committee. Similarly, in the wider area of management systems and evaluation procedures, it will be able to be examine in depth whether they are inadequate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has been constantly defensive on this aspect. I remind the Senate that, when questioned in the Estimates Committee hearings in September 1990 as to whether there have been any independent or objective assessments of management and support, the head of the corporate management division claimed that the Department had just developed an external evaluation plan in which DFAT had invited the Department of Finance to participate.
       </para>
       <para>
        To balance that-and from a more objective point of view-we had the advice of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), which subsequently reported that DFAT had shown resistance to the implementation of stage 1 of program evaluation `and lack of understanding of and commitment to evaluation'. That was in the ANAO audit report No. 23, with which Senator Watson is probably very familiar. It was said that DFAT had found it difficult to get corporate commitment to the evaluation strategy and, consequently, general staff commitment. The ANAO concluded that DFAT has so far made very little progress with the evaluation strategy. The Minister's answer to that was that his Department was a policy department and policy departments should be treated differently.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is Senator Coates's Committee which can best make the assessment on behalf of this parliamentary process as to whether the Minister's case has been made out or whether the case of ANAO is made out, and the Department should be treated in the same way as any other department.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in fact long overdue for a substantial review of its structure and administrative efficiency. The last comprehensive review of the Department was in its former state, pre-amalgamation, which was back in 1978. It was conducted, I have to concede, by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. There has not been an external evaluation since. There have been some internal evaluations of particular aspects, but there has not been any evaluation in the post-amalgamation period, that is, since the Department of Trade and the Department of Foreign Affairs were brought together.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, which I am excluding really from this reference, has been examined in depth both by the Jackson Committee of Review on the Australian Overseas Aid Program in 1983 and by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in 1989. Austrade, of course, was subject to a major external review recently by management consultants McKinsey and Co. Inc., and that has now been brought within the Department also. The core administration of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not been subject to any such review, and I think it is time now for such outside scrutiny. A McKinsey type inquiry, I say in passing, might in fact be a better course of action. We did float that in the Estimates Committee but certainly the senior officers of the Department did not respond positively to the suggestion that it might be in their best interests to be subjected to a comprehensive outside professional evaluation. So we return to the mechanisms within our control, the committees of this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the Department 1990 was clearly a bad year. There were numerous allegations of maladministration, leaks of sensitive documents and claims of indifference to overseas conditions of service leading, regrettably, to industrial action. There were clear signs of morale and discipline falling. I see that personally from the number of representations I receive from officers within the Department-very genuine and well meaning people who are concerned by these various issues. In the supporting information to the motion I put in December last year I gave a sketch of details of a whole series of security leaks before that date.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Estimates Committee I have given details of some 12 very serious leaks between that Estimates Committee and this one on the Supplementary Estimates, and there have been at least five very serious and damaging leaks since then, despite the Minister's assurances that this was now going to change. I raised one in the Senate concerning the Australian Government's assessment of Singapore's involvement in Burma, which was so embarrassing to have leaked, and another concerning the Khmer Rouge and the fact that it was gaining benefit under the various plans. I will not detail them now because now is not the place. The place to put them is before the Standing Committee so it can examine them.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is evident on the face of that is that there is not in existence at the moment a system which can adequately safeguard the highly sensitive information of the Department. Hopefully the Senate Standing Committee will be able to constructively help with that. As I indicated a moment ago, I have been told that morale has been affected by the ongoing problems, and one of those problems relates to conditions of service overseas. The overseas living allowance (OLA) system has been criticised for being non-transparent in the sense that no-one can give a proper explanation as to how various allowances for service overseas have been arrived at.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans expressed the hope to the Estimates Committee in September 1990 that there could be a just and final outcome and proper processes in place for the future which are a bit more transparent and a bit more systematic than has been the case in the past, but as it has turned out the result is not to the satisfaction of staff. Subsequently Senator Evans said that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) had negotiated a package which was fair and balanced, though not as generous as ideally. He noted that staff at some posts accepted the packages while others did not.
       </para>
       <para>
        What he failed to address, however, was the issue of transparency, which he had earlier stated to be the central issue. Staff feel that their salary and allowance packages are constantly rising and falling without any predictability or identifiable relationship to conditions at the post. The net result is that there is considerable dissatisfaction. Much of this dissatisfaction can be linked to the fact that the issue has dragged on for years with the Department apparently helpless to deal with such a major issue affecting its management and administrative performances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department's annual report in 1986-87 recorded that OLA `failed to meet all the objectives set for it by the Public Service Board and operating departments'. The following year, the annual report was able to say that the Department of Industrial Relations agreed to address anomalies identified by internal review of OLA. And so the issue dragged on for four years before reaching its present position. It seems that, in that unsatisfactory situation, some outside body should look at OLA and, hopefully after the passage of this motion, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration will be able to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another aspect of the morale problems has arisen from the issues that have not been adequately addressed in and following the amalgamation of the departments. I am advised that the Foreign Affairs officers' (FAO) stream, which was a fundamental principle of departmental organisation from its establishment and the route to the top for most present senior departmental managers, was abolished to accommodate the amalgamation with the Department of Trade but it continues to influence the working of the Department. So there is a situation of confusion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Positions were designated policy or administrative, partially reflecting the former distinction between the Foreign Affairs officer and consular-administrative streams. Former trade officers have fitted uneasily into this new structure. Officers not recruited via the FAO stream, whether from Trade or the former consular-administrative stream, often feel disadvantaged and threatened. The statement put to the Estimates Committee by the Department that there are people in the Department without the skills required now and required increasingly in the future alludes to this problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        Officers spoke of the need for training or the possibility of early retirement packages. Attempts such as this to get rid of perceived troublemakers will not solve the fundamental problems that have given rise to them, and such issues arising out of the amalgamation that have not adequately met the concerns of officers of the Department can be looked at by this Senate Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, the notice of motion of 21 December, as subsequently amended, seeks to bring independent analysis and public scrutiny to the operations of DFAT in a way that will assist the Department to fulfil its charter in relation to the conduct of Australia's international relations. It seeks to look at the serious allegations and symptoms of poor morale within the general context of the management systems and program evaluation procedures of the Department. If the Department has already taken action to solve all of the problems that have been aired, which does not seem to be the case from what has been put before the Estimates Committee in any event, the Senate Standing Committee report can only help to restore confidence in the Department. If action has not been taken, the Committee can make recommendations to assist the solution of the problems facing the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said at the outset, it is now 13 years since such a public inquiry has been made into DFAT and, bearing in mind both the major changes that the Department has undergone in recent years and the continuing signs of management and morale problems, an independent examination of the management and operation of the Department is long overdue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regret to say that the Minister has shown little interest in questions relating to the administration of the Department. Perhaps if he had been more interested and concerned with the terms and conditions of service of his officers, this inquiry may not have been necessary.

       <para>
        The report of the Administrative Review Council, entitled Review of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act: Statements of Reasons for Decisions, addresses the issue of what power the judicature should have in dealing with the Executive. The Executive and the judicature are two separate arms of government, the third being the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The phrase `separation of powers' has an esoteric ring to it but describes a mechanism that is central to the well-being of the community. Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitution establish that mechanism by distributing the powers of government amongst the Parliament, the Executive and the judicature. When each of the three entities exercise distinct powers of government, there is a reasonable expectation that a happy balance will evolve: where none can harm any member of the community, all should serve. Unfortunately, imbalances keep arising which allow people to be damaged by the actions of one or more of the entities.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent times there has been much proper concern expressed about the way the dynamics at work among the arms of government have been markedly disturbed. Senator Peter Walsh turned his considerable mind to the issue in his article in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, 18 June 1991, in which he points out that bodies such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Resource Assessment Commission, the Law Reform Commission, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other such bodies have taken on work which was formerly done by parliamentarians. Senator Walsh, in doing that, has raised a central issue which we as a parliament should address. The fact is that for many years now Parliament has not exercised the restraint over the Executive that it formerly exercised. There have had to be other bodies set up to deal with that.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, we have statements by Mr Justice Brennan of the High Court of Australia, a very eminent jurist, who says that in fact the Executive has now taken on too much power. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        As the wind of political expediency now chills Parliament's willingness to impose checks on the Executive and the Executive now has a large measure of control over legislation, the courts alone retain their original function of standing between government and the governed.
       </para>
       <para>
        He puts in a plea-if that is the way to put it-for the courts to have an ability to exercise a proper power over the Executive. Senator Walsh and Mr Justice Brennan are two of the many people now raising the issue of the proper relationship between the arms of government. It is an important issue, one that we ought to deal with more fully than we do and one which is addressed in this excellent report.

        I note the list of people who are on the Administrative Review Council. Professor Cheryl Saunders is the President.

It is proper that those views be discussed further with them.

       We have had access to this report for two hours or so-maybe slightly more. This is an extensive and long report by the Auditor-General entitled Department of Community Services and Health- Administration of the Medicare Benefits Schedule. It should be noted on every occasion in this chamber when mention is made of the Medicare benefits schedule (MBS) that it is a myth perpetrated by those on the other side that the Medicare levy of 1.25 per cent of our incomes covers the cost of medical and hospital services. The message that needs to be put across over and over again is that the levy contributes only about one-third of the funding that is outlaid on Medicare programs. Anybody in the Australian community who thinks that their Medicare levy is paying for the medical expenses of this country is living in the land of--

        —Yes, we have not had enough dreams! This report is in some ways a condemnation and it also indicates the head-in-the-sand attitude of the Department of Community Services and Health. It is a condemnation of both the administration of the Medicare benefits program and the lack of responsiveness by the Department to the recommendations made by the Auditor-General.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It seems to me that this sort of thing is frequently experienced. When the Privacy Commissioner expressed concerns, the Government did not respond. Here is the Auditor-General expressing concerns, as he did with issues such as Telecom Australia, the system for social security and the matters that we raised yesterday. The Auditor-General has outlined a lack of care and attention to detail, which means that the taxpayer is paying the bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the things that this report has highlighted is that there has been a deterioration in the basis of how the fees are set. These fees have grown up across time a bit like Topsy and the Auditor-General is recommending that a standard methodology for establishing the value of schedule fees should be developed and that there should be a greater consistency and equity of fees between items in the MBS.
      </para>
      <para>
       This report also points out that there has been quite a significant growth in Medicare benefit outlays. We all know that much of this growth can be attributed to a number of issues, such as the ageing of our population, greater dependence of our population on medication, the ease of access to medical advice and also the increased size of the population. The Auditor-General also points out that one of the contributing factors in the increased cost of medical services has been direct billing. In fact, he says that a significant proportion of this cost has been as a result of direct billing. The Auditor-General says on page 15 of this report:
      </para>
      <para>
       It was noted by the ANAO that the areas with the highest growth in outlays are frequently those areas with a high proportion of direct billing.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have a number of problems here. The Department has said that this is not necessarily the case. It has buried its head in the sand over this issue and says that the Auditor-General should have come up with much better figures and a much better method of examining the matter. It has been quite derogatory in some ways about the recommendation that this issue ought to be addressed. But there are a number of areas in regard to direct billing that ought to be addressed. A number of people are responsible. Firstly, the Government and the Department of Community Services and Health ought to be addressing it. Secondly, our medical profession has a responsibility to the Australian community not to abuse the system of direct billing. Also, we as citizens have a responsibility to realise that every time we go to the doctor and are direct billed our fellow taxpayer is contributing, since our Medicare levy does not cover the cost of our medical expenses.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report signifies that there is a real need for a total review, a total analysis, and some very clear-headed thinking with regard to the cost of medical benefits to our population. We have seen an enormous growth in Medicare benefit outlays. The Auditor-General says that the cost of medical services to the patient has grown and the cost to the community has grown. If that cost has grown, we ought to have seen an improvement in public health; otherwise the cost increase is not justified. The Auditor-General says:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the cost of medical services to the patient, as represented by the difference between provider charges and benefits received, increased from $295 million in 1985-86 to $668 million in 1988-89. In this period the patient contribution to the cost of medical services increased from 10% to 16%. A proportion of this higher cost can be recovered if patients have private health insurance but this is ultimately reflected in higher insurance premiums.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given the current Government's policy, because of these increased costs and increased premiums and because of the myth that the Medicare levy covers the cost of our health care, in 1990, the Auditor-General says, only 43 per cent of the population has private insurance. Many of those are pensioners, people least able to afford it but who realise that they are the ones who are going to join the hospital waiting queues in every State. Many of them are taking out or keeping their health insurance and paying the higher premium.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Auditor-General's report-as I said, we have not had time to go through it in absolute detail-has put the Department on notice that there are many areas that it can address and savings that can be made. Our Medicare benefit payments have increased from $2.6 billion in 1985-86 to $3.8 billion in 1989-90. We cannot afford that sort of escalation without a very serious review of how we can curb those costs and maintain an adequate and proper standard of public health.

        —I refer to the Auditor-General's report regarding the administration of the Medicare benefits schedule. The report highlights the need for a more systematic process for the review of items and fees in the Medicare benefits schedule. It recommends that improved information gathering systems and analytical techniques should be developed to provide early detection and timely implementation of required amendments to the schedule. It also points to the need to develop a strategic plan for a comprehensive and systematic review of sections of the schedule. The audit found that a variety of methods have been used to determine Medicare schedule fees and, in the absence of a standard methodology, there is no readily available measure to assess the consistency and equity of fees.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Analysis of change to Medicare fees in recent years revealed that actions by medical practitioners had limited the effectiveness of measures to reduce Medicare outlays. It was also noted that reductions in scheduled fees have generally resulted in reduced observance of scheduled fees by medical practitioners and an increased contribution by patients towards the cost of medical services. Bulk-billing has been actively encouraged by the Government and has obviously been increasingly taken up by general practitioners.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is fairly obvious that the 50 per cent increase in the number of doctors between 1980 and 1990-now 38,000 in Australia and increasing by 800 each year-has meant an oversupply of medical practitioners. This has been accentuated by the number of immigrant doctors now being registered. It is estimated that 350 medical graduates enter the country every year-the equivalent of the output of two Australian medical schools. This is to the detriment of the students wishing to go through our medical schools-Australian children, 30 per cent of whom are the children of immigrants. Australia now has the second lowest doctor-patient ratio in the world-second only to Belgium.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is little doubt that this combination of oversupply and increased competition has led to an increase in the number of medical services being bulk-billed. Last week I received a letter from a friend of mine who is the Professor of Surgery at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former President of the American Association of Surgeons. The letter states:
      </para>
      <para>
       I intend to spend my spare time within the coming year demonstrating that we have about 20 per cent more physicians in the United States than we currently need. We made the mistake of opening our doors to tens of thousands of immigrant physicians. They haven't done any harm, have done no measurable good, and have cost us a bundle! Finally, about two years ago the government woke up and stopped the immigration entirely. It was contrary to our constitutional philosophy, but the cost became unbearable. I have some fascinating data which show that the cost per unit service (office visits/operations) is a straight line function of the number of doctors per 100,000 population. It is directly contrary to the law of supply and demand--

The Government has attempted to control the burgeoning cost by decreasing the refund on medical fees, particularly in pathology, and also by reducing the refund for in-patient procedures from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the scheduled fee. This has resulted in an increasing gap between Medicare fees and Medicare refund. In fact, that gap has increased by 120 per cent in the last five years. Is it any wonder that people are complaining about this gap when they are forbidden by the law of this Government to insure themselves for it unless they are in-patients in a hospital?

       Paradoxically, the increasing cost of private hospital insurance has led to an increase of 100 per cent in insurance rates in the last five years which, in turn, has led to a fall in the number of people covered by private insurance from 70 per cent in 1983 to 43 per cent in 1991. My own State of Queensland has an insurance rate as low as 32 per cent. The Government does not seem to understand that for every one per cent of the population which opts out of private cover, $80m is added to the public sector cost per annum.

       Finally, the direction in which Medicare is heading will mean that not only will Australia be a banana republic in economic terms, but also, with the rationing of health care, we will have good quality health care available only to those who can afford it, and lengthening queues for those who cannot. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —Neither the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 nor the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991, which are allied Bills, are earth shattering. With the exception of one matter, which we will be opposing at the committee stage, we support the two Bills. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 contains some relatively minor policy changes and allows for the amendments made to the 1947 Social Security Act during the current autumn sittings to be incorporated into the `plain English' Social Security Act.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The proposal that we regard as most controversial and the one to which we are opposed, relates to those clauses which seek to change the eligibility criteria for special benefits, allowing them to be payable at the discretion of the Secretary of the Department to a person who is the holder of a conditional two-year residence permit, granted on the basis of a relationship with an Australian resident, where the application for that payment was made on or after 15 April 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the recently introduced migration rules, as from 15 April this year a two-year conditional residence permit can be granted to a person who has entered into a formal marriage or a de facto relationship with an Australian citizen or resident. The proposed change would allow special benefits to be paid to such persons and, if necessary, backdated to the commencement date of the new rule. It must be presumed that applicants for such conditional entry permits and, indeed, the overwhelming proportion of migrants to this country, are able-bodied citizens who are entering Australia with adequate means of support. To allow newly arrived migrants immediately to receive social security income support sends precisely the wrong signal to prospective entrants.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, the way in which this clause is framed would enable people to come here under the guise of entering-or having entered-into a permanent relationship, be granted a conditional entry permit for the next two years, immediately receive special benefits, then dissolve the relationship, have the entry permit terminated and leave the premises, so to speak, having received welfare payments for the duration of that term of entry. That seems to us to be inherently unsound.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no justification for, in effect, inviting people to come to this country on, in a sense, a probationary basis. That is the whole purpose of denying them permanent entry status. They come here seeking to prove their bona fides-otherwise they are queue jumpers. It is proposed that we then should turn around and offer them welfare payments. We do not think that is adequate and, therefore, we propose that these clauses be removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is even less justification for any retrospective operation. Whilst the Department may have promised such payments as from 1 April, it had no authority to do so. Presuming the new arrivals have survived financially to date, there is no justification for now providing them with a backdated lump sum payment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other changes involve the indexation of the maintenance income free area. That is an uncontroversial proposition. The measure will ensure that the allowable level of child support is not eroded over time by inflation. The indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance, which is to be indexed from the first pension or benefit payday after 20 September each year, does have very significant financial consequences because it involves an estimated annual cost in excess of $200m. Nonetheless, given the commitments that were made to pensioners in the context of the changes in the last Budget which replaced the pharmaceutical beneficiary charge, I think we would take the view it is proper that the amount of the allowance be indexed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We support the changes to the pension portability provisions. The Bill adds further refinements to the restrictions on the portability of wives and class B widows' pensions which were put in place last year. Otherwise, we can have a situation-it exists presently-where people who have never resided in this country have married an Australian resident, who then dies, and then remain perhaps at their place of birth and continue to receive a widow's pension. We share the Government's view that in those circumstances those people should not be entitled to continuing welfare support. We therefore support that proposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The pharmaceutical benefits card eligibility is another measure that the Opposition supports. In the last Budget, pensioners were promised that they would not lose their entitlements to the pharmaceutical benefits card if, as a result of complying with the deeming arrangements, the rate of return on their savings took them above the designated savings threshold, which in respect of fringe benefits is currently $95 a week. As a result of the rearrangement of assets, the whole purpose of the exercise is that people will be pushed to a point where they are entitled to less pension moneys than they would otherwise have received, thus ensuring that they maximise their returns on their investments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Patterson, who has identified a transitional difficulty which I see the Government is now proposing to correct. That will honour the promise; so we will simply find that, as from March when the deeming legislation came into force, not only those people but also anyone who has rearranged their affairs as a result of the Budget announcement will be protected.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition accepts that the reciprocal social security arrangement with the Netherlands ought to be written into the Bill. That will, as it does in most other instances, bind other countries into paying pensions and benefits for their nationals residing in Australia. The agreement will result in an estimated net saving of almost $8m in the 1991-92 financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one other matter to which I should advert at this stage and that is the provision which would exempt the Secretary's power to waive a debt from review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. This matter has had a somewhat chequered history. I think it is largely the responsibility of the Government that we have reached the situation where it has been necessary to spend a lot of time agonising over the meaning of the current provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills took the view in 1988 that there was indeed not an ability in the Tribunal to override the power of the Minister to override the power of the Secretary, in effect, to vary or amend waiver arrangements. I think that has been the conventional wisdom and we certainly proceeded on that basis when considering earlier legislation only a couple of weeks ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent days I have been provided with some material, including a legal advice, which for the first time spells out that the Government believes it is still possible to interpret the provisions in such a way that the Tribunal would be able to override in respect of general waivers. We take the view that, whilst it is important for the Tribunal to retain the right to pass ultimate judgment on the circumstances of individual cases, it is not appropriate for the Tribunal, in effect, to second guess policy matters where the Minister has determined on a policy basis that certain categories or classes of people ought not to be entitled to the waiver. In those circumstances we believe that the decision of the Minister ought to be final and that the matter should not be able to be reviewed by the Tribunal. Therefore, we will not be opposing that provision. The rewrite Bill contains a number of propositions with which we do not agree, but I will not trouble the Senate further with any analysis.

         —These Bills originally entered the Senate as part of a package of three. The Australian Democrats are very pleased to note that, with the support of the Liberal Party, we have managed to move the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill off to a committee for further consideration; and, in particular, to give those people most affected by this Bill-that is, people with disabilities, their families and the groups representing them-time to look at all the implications of what is a very major change.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 implements minor policy changes and incorporates into the 1991 Social Security Act amendments made to the previous 1947 Act during the autumn session. I want to cover only a few of these changes this evening. Firstly, let us look at the provision of special benefits and the eligibility criteria: the Bill provides for special benefits to be payable to a person who is a holder of an extended eligibility or spouse entry permit under the Migration Act. Unfortunately, again there have been a lot of very strange ideas spread around about what these provisions actually mean. Firstly, I stress that it does not mean that people entering the country can stroll in at any time and, regardless of need or their financial or other circumstances, tap into our social security system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Special benefit is a discretionary benefit. Essentially, it is a hardship provision. There are very stringent eligibility criteria that have to be met. It is a last resort for those people who have absolutely no other support service available-no other means of income support. People who have been granted conditional entry into this country should not be forced to starve on the streets. We have accepted these people into the country-the first step, hopefully, towards their becoming Australian citizens-and I do not think they should be excluded from this form of assistance, which is, as I said, their last hope.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, these provisions seem to have provided some people with the chance to severely criticise migrants, in particular. They have suggested, for example, that suddenly we will be flooded by hordes of people, realising what a wonderful social security system we have, rushing to Australia's shores. That is simply not accurate. Further information that I was able to obtain today shows that lawyers who work in this field stress that it is not easy to access special benefit; that the permit is in force for two years and this is a trial period; that the people must prove that they are genuinely seeking permanent residence; and that they must be in a permanent relationship and simply cannot get one of the entry permits if they are not.
       </para>
       <para>
        Experienced legal practitioners in the immigration area will tell us of many cases where the partner of one of these permit holders or, indeed, the permit holder himself or herself fell ill, had a serious accident and-prior to the amendment we are looking at today-had no means of support, no income at all. A Sydney-based barrister told me that she had seen people in these circumstances who were so desperate they had spoken of suicide or of returning to their home country where they would be faced by persecution, simply because they could not get any income at all in Australia through circumstances that, I must stress, are no fault of theirs whatsoever. The amendments before us, which we commend to the Senate, are designed to pick up these sorts of very deserving cases-and I stress again that there are not many of them. There are not thousands of people; there are a small number of people to whom, if this amendment is defeated tonight, we will be denying access to any support at all, whether there are special circumstances or not.
       </para>
       <para>
        A retrospective element identified in this Bill is a provision regarding a commencement date of 15 April. I understand, and I will ask the Minister later as we move into committee, that this is presumably because of the linkage with the changes in the migration regulations which were done on this date. Again, the Democrats do not generally consider retrospective elements to be desirable, but we see this example as not being of great concern. It was not of great concern to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It could perhaps be best described as a benign example and it will certainly not disadvantage anyone. So in these circumstances we will not be opposing this clause.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for the maintenance income areas for pensioners and beneficiaries to be indexed on 1 July each year. This refers to the amount of maintenance or child support people can receive before their pension or benefit is affected. I note with interest the Minister's answer to a question of mine today in Question Time where he assured us that the very unjust practice of limiting maintenance income to only $15 before the pension is affected, or $5 for each additional child, will be looked at. Hopefully, it will at least rise to the $40 income that is permissible from any other source. We would hope that the income levels would rise substantially to help to reduce the poverty traps that single parents are currently facing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, the Bill contains provisions for the indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance. We also support this move, but feel obliged to point out yet again that the way the allowance is structured discriminates against married couples by providing them with the same amount of allowance as would be received by a single person. At the time this allowance was introduced last year, I made the point that this discrimination makes very little sense. It makes things extremely difficult, particularly for older married couples. We have had many letters from pensioner couples whose situation confirms this. Without much hope, I ask the Government to take another look at this problem-hopefully, it will be done in the Budget this year-and in particular to look at the problems of the really elderly people who are suffering, both of them in many cases, chronic illness or disability. The remainder of this Bill incorporates changes in the autumn session to the new Social Security Act, and the only problem we have here is with clause 20. We will be moving the same amendment as we moved a week or so previously to ensure that guidelines relating to the waiving of debts to the Department of Social Security are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill contains no policy changes. It is basically a transitional piece of legislation to ensure that the new Act incorporates changes made in the 1990 Budget session. We have no problems with this Bill and will not be moving any amendments. I take this opportunity to comment briefly on two particular social security issues that are of concern. Firstly, referring to waiting periods, I would recommend as reading for those honourable senators who are concerned at the great difficulties being faced by the people suffering hardest from this recession that we had to have the recent Victorian Council of Social Service (VCOSS) report, No Reason to Wait for Social Security. This report urges the Government to abolish a variety of waiting periods: the one-week ordinary waiting period which, I might add, usually spreads out to at least three weeks before any support is given; the four-week liquid assets test waiting period; the 26-week wait for rent assistance; and, I note in particular, a reduction in the 13-week waiting period or the three months that education leavers under 21 must currently endure. I stress here that these are education leavers. They are not people dropping out for the sake of dropping out; they are those who have graduated and those who have, unfortunately, failed their course from colleges of technical and further education, universities or whatever.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report identified waiting periods for social security benefits as a key factor in the increased demand for emergency relief and food vouchers. In response to this report, the Australian reported a spokesperson for the Minister as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister is aware of the concerns of . . . welfare groups and they will be considered seriously as part of the Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        But on 5 June when we were debating the Job Search and Newstart legislation in this chamber, the Minister expressly stated that he had decided not to raise the matter of education leaver waiting periods. Unfortunately, the Minister is not with us now, but I will certainly be asking him during the committee stage whether he will raise any of the waiting periods for Job Search and Newstart allowances discussed in the VCOSS report as part of the Budget discussions. I again note that the VCOSS report confirms that these waiting periods are causing hardship and increasing the demands on welfare agencies. Not only that, they are patently unfair and they further penalise people who are out of the work force because of this Government's economic policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area I wish to look at briefly tonight is income security for farming families. All those present in this chamber are well aware of the rural crisis. It was debated again last night as we looked at the wool legislation. I stress that sheep farmers are probably amongst the hardest hit of rural people. The enormous amount of hardship is both financial and social. The problem of providing appropriate and adequate income support to farming families this year is critical.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia Inc. estimates that 80 per cent of farmers in South Australia will not make enough money this year to meet costs. In April, a senior official from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy was reported in the Age as predicting:
       </para>
       <para>
        There would be a serious social crisis in rural Australia by the middle of 1992, despite an expected pick-up in rural exports next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to note that in the vast majority of cases the income crisis faced by farming families arises through no fault of their own. It is being caused by the unique coincidence of international and national conditions, many of which can be directly traced to the European Community and United States Government subsidies and other supports for their farmers.
       </para>
       <para>
        An Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study has found that farmers in Western countries received $383 billion in subsidies last year. That is as much as Australia's total gross domestic product. In fact, the OECD's monitoring of agricultural protection showed that the cost of subsidies soared by 12 per cent in 1990. This is at precisely the same time as the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks were supposed to be achieving a decrease but were achieving exactly the opposite. In Europe, government subsidies and other support to farmers jumped $105 billion, providing 48 per cent of farmers' incomes. In the United States, government subsidies and support for farmers provides 30 per cent of farm incomes; in Japan, it is 68 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only two countries the OECD could find worthy of praise were Australia and New Zealand-the agricultural odd couple. Australia's support for farmers is now at 11 per cent and New Zealand's is down to 5 per cent. It seems that in every country other than Australia and New Zealand governments are persuaded by arguments that farming actually has a purpose greater than its substantial economic value; it has social and other benefits which deserve acknowledgment and protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other governments around the world recognise the value of farmers, farming families and rural communities and support them. This is something that this Government and, unfortunately at times, this Opposition either cannot or will not recognise. The question of the appropriate way to support Australian farming families should be exercising all of our minds in the chamber at this very serious time. The question is: what is the appropriate way to assist farming families? Is it to provide income security for farmers through direct price support, through the rural adjustment scheme or through the means provided to all other Australians-that is, the social security system? This is the matter for debate and that debate must take place urgently.
       </para>
       <para>
        Above all, it is our responsibility to provide certainty for rural families about their rights and their futures. Quite clearly it is not being done at the moment. In fact, the opposite is occurring. A letter from Mr Con Sciacca, the honourable member for Bowman and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, written to the State Association of Rural Counselling Services in South Australia, dated 6 May 1991, reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Social security was never intended to be a subsidy for uneconomic enterprises but a payment to those who are unable to earn a living because of unemployment, age, infirmity or family responsibilities. It is not an appropriate means of assisting farmers who still own considerable business assets but who are without an income or whose income is committed because of debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        This quotation clearly lays the ground rules as far as the Department of Social Security (DSS) is concerned: farming families are not appropriate candidates for social security payments. That was on 6 May. Yet on 13 May the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and now Treasurer (Mr Kerin) encouraged farmers to apply for social security payments.I quote from in an article in the Australian on 13 May 1991:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Kerin said yesterday that Cabinet confirmed on April 17, when funding to the Rural Adjustment Scheme was increased by $100 million to $164 million, that farmers were eligible for hardship provisions under the Social Security Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, Mr Kerin referred to section 7 of the Act. The article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Farmers who meet the other normal eligibility conditions may qualify for support under hardship provisions and may receive unemployment, sickness, or special benefits and pensions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on:
       </para>
       <para>
        To receive a social security payment, farmers must prove severe financial hardship by:
       </para>
       <para>
        HAVING a total income less than the maximum fortnightly benefit applicable.
       </para>
       <para>
        as that is about $243 currently, that is very easy for farmers to do-
       </para>
       <para>
        SHOWING that readily available funds do not exceed $6,000 for a single person or $10,000 for a married couple.
       </para>
       <para>
        again that is very easy to do-
       </para>
       <para>
        EXHAUSTING all other possible avenues to improve their financial position.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a possible question mark there. Does that mean that they have to put the farm on the market? The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        NOT receiving any other forms of Commonwealth assistance, including Department of Veterans Affairs pensions or the household support section of the Rural Adjustment Scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a contentious issue. My office conducted a survey of all the DSS offices in rural South Australia and we were told there had been virtually no-one successful at getting onto social security benefits through the existing hardship provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to Maggie Martinelli of the South Australian Welfare Rights Centre, this is not surprising because there is virtually no-one being told they can apply. Contrary to the advice given by Mr Kerin, people are being told at the DSS counter that they must apply for household support. According to Maggie, the DSS has been positively obstructionist in providing adequate information and advice to farming families. DSS does not tell farmers that perhaps their wives are eligible for unemployment benefits. It does not tell farmers that if they are not happy with what they are being told, there is a right to appeal. Or perhaps they are simply told there are no appeal forms available anyway.
       </para>
       <para>
        The advice that they must apply for household support first is simply not correct. Household support is paid through the rural adjustment scheme to meet living expenses while the farmer considers whether to adjust out of farming. The farmer must be unable to obtain financial assistance elsewhere. It is not necessary for the farm to be put on the market to receive the support. However, it is normally only granted for more than three months if the Department considers the farmer is making a genuine attempt to leave farming but cannot undertake full time work off the farm because of his farming responsibilities-for example, maintaining fences and looking after stock.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems quite clear to us that the Department of Social Security is deliberately leading farmers up the garden path. It is making it virtually impossible for them to access benefits. There is also the paperwork if indeed they do make it past the front counter. Rural counsellors in South Australia, and it is certainly more than just a couple, assure us it runs to something like 35 pages of paperwork. It can take somewhere around three and a half hours to complete, and that is with an advocate, whether that advocate be a rural counsellor or, in some cases, an accountant. It seems to me that however we look at this problem it comes down to its being a matter of government and departmental will.
       </para>
       <para>
        The infrastructure is there to assist farming families, but the jumbled, confused maze of advice and competing interests, or perhaps disinterests, is severely hampering the possibilities of farmers accessing support. There is a swirl of assets test, asset valuation practices, hardship provisions, work tests, income tests and competing advice that farming families must wade their way through to obtain any support. Simplification, clarification, reprioritisation are all needed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am taking this opportunity now to indicate that this is an area which the Democrats believe urgently requires Government attention. We hope that this will occur during the Budget session, if not before, and I can assure the chamber that the Democrats will be watching this area carefully and will be taking action in the Budget session if none is forthcoming from the Government.

         —Tonight we are debating two social security Bills, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991. Both of these Bills incorporate into the new clear-English Act a range of changes to the social security system that have occurred since the last Budget. The rewrite Bill also makes a number of minor changes which help clarify the intent of the new Act.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) also seeks to introduce a number of relatively minor policy changes into the Social Security Act, including allowing the payment of special benefit to holders of a conditional two-year residence permit, the indexation of the income-free area for the maintenance income test, the indexation of the $2.50 pharmaceutical allowance and the continued provision of fringe benefits cards to those pensioners who have exceeded the fringe benefit threshold.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition will oppose the Government's attempt to allow non-permanent residents access to special benefits. It seems bizarre to tell supposedly able-bodied people that our Government will look after them. This clause is sending precisely the wrong signals to migrants. Rather than encouraging a welfare mentality, governments should be creating opportunities and rewarding individual excellence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to concentrate on just one of these issues, namely the decision to allow pensioners to retain concession cards if they exceed the fringe benefits threshold due to deeming. This promise is indicative of the Government's bandaid approach to decision making but, as with most bandaids, this one seems to have come unstuck.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Budget, it was announced that all pensioner investments above a certain amount would be deemed to be earning 10 per cent per annum. This decision caused an outcry from pensioners. One of their biggest concerns was that they would lose fringe benefits because extra income earned, or deemed to be earned, would take them over the fringe benefits threshold.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pensioners value their fringe benefits highly and are very protective of them-sometimes not in a justified way. In fact, they would be better to have earned their income. But they do feel very protective of these fringe benefits. It is difficult to put a monetary value on the fringe benefits card, but it can be used to obtain a range of concessions from Federal, State and local agencies on rates, electricity, public transport, pharmaceuticals and other items.
       </para>
       <para>
        In an attempt to curb the angry masses, the magnanimous Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) made an off the-cuff decision that no pensioner entitled to fringe benefits at the time of the Budget would lose these benefits as a result of the deeming initiative. There was no Cabinet decision, no mention in the Budget, no costings, no legislation-just a kind and compassionate Minister with a very keen eye on the pensioner vote at the next election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Everything seemed rosy. The Minister had stemmed the pensioner outcry. There was little cost for the Federal Government as the majority of fringe benefits are paid by State and local governments. However, there were unforseen circumstances that cast doubt on the fairness and equity of the Minister's promise.
       </para>
       <para>
        I began receiving phone calls from pensioners who had been maintaining their income in higher interest bearing accounts prior to the Budget and who were concerned that they would continue to be ineligible for fringe benefits, although their incomes were identical to or even less than the incomes of those people who stood to benefit from the Minister's promise. What crime had these pensioners committed? None. What they were doing was honestly investing their income, their capital, earning interest and declaring it to the Government. Ironically, they were paying the price for having conducted their financial affairs in a way that is now being openly endorsed and encouraged by the Federal Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister's promise also discriminates against pensioners whose extra income is derived from sources other than interest bearing accounts. They remain ineligible for fringe benefits, even though their total income may be no greater, or quite possibly less, than someone who remains entitled to fringe benefits. The Minister is responsible for engineering an inequitable welfare system in which pensioners with identical incomes and assets are entitled to different government benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        What was the Minister's response when I asked him what would be done to rectify this inequitable situation? He claimed that he would be using the `new-federalism' process over the next two years to introduce uniformity in fringe benefits between States. What hypocrisy! The Minister's own doorstop promise caused the inequitable situation whereby pensioners with identical income and assets have different fringe benefits entitlements. Then he stands up in the Senate claiming that he is working on achieving a uniform system of fringe benefits. I remind the Minister that the charter of the Department of Social Security states:
       </para>
       <para>
        To deliver social security entitlements with fairness, courtesy and efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        My emphasis is on fairness. The Minister's promise pays scant regard to the fairness principle. There is nothing fair about two people with identical incomes and assets having different fringe benefits entitlements. It would also be overgenerous to classify the Department's implementation of the Minister's promise as being within the realms of `efficient delivery of social security entitlements', as specified in the Department's charter.
       </para>
       <para>
        To be fair to the Department, some of these administrative problems stem from the impromptu nature of the Minister's promise. First, there was the inexcusable situation whereby people who were granted the pension after the Minister's promise were told that they were eligible for fringe benefits. They were later told, `Sorry, actually you are not eligible'. When one such person complained to the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) wrote back saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, due to a computer programming error-
       </para>
       <para>
        I remember reading just recently a quite interesting quote in a book, `Who did people blame before there were computers?'-
       </para>
       <para>
        when implementing the Government's deeming measures, some pensioners were incorrectly advised that they were entitled to fringe benefits. It was necessary to advise pensioners of their non-entitlement to fringe benefits when the mistake was discovered.
       </para>
       <para>
        This was a good try by Mr Sciacca, but it was not quite right, as the Secretary to the Department admitted in the Senate Estimates in April. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . some people were issued with fringe benefits cards following the Budget in the understanding that they were not eligible for them but to be sure that we met the Government's commitment in respect of people retaining PHB Cards, regardless of what happened with deeming. As soon as the systems changes were made, we wrote to those people to inform them that they were not eligible for those cards. The problem we had was that the database did not identify certain categories of people and it was very much a short term arrangement we pursued.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I go on to the second example, I refer again to the charter:
       </para>
       <para>
        To deliver social security entitlements with fairness, courtesy and efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        Problem No. 2 is that the Minister promised that no-one would lose their fringe benefits entitlement as a result of the deeming even if their pension were cancelled. Unfortunately, Social Security's administration of the promise did not quite reflect the promise, as this excerpt from a letter kindly provided by the shadow Minister for social security, child-care and retirement incomes, Senator Alston, shows:
       </para>
       <para>
        The government did guarantee that holders of these cards would not be disadvantaged by doing the right thing and rearranging their affairs to maximise their income. This means that although your pension has been cancelled due to an increase in your income you are entitled to retain your card. The problem has been that automatic devices have not been updated to reflect this policy change. If you have not destroyed your card as instructed you may continue to use it. If however you have destroyed the card could you please contact me as soon as possible so that I can arrange to reissue your card immediately.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are both examples of the administrative problems faced by an inflexible department which is faced with implementing an impromptu promise that has been made by its Minister. Without downplaying the significance of those examples, my third example is a potentially far more drastic administrative blunder which the Senate must address today during this cognate debate. As I said earlier, this legislation attempts to give legal status to the Minister's fringe benefits promise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say that while the Minister has an army of legal eagles, an army of people with experience in social security legislation and an army of draftspeople to prepare the legislation, my office conducted a close scrutiny of this legislation and found that they had got it wrong. We spend half our lives-that may be a slight exaggeration-in this chamber correcting legislation, often when it has gone through the Senate, because it is brought in at the eleventh hour and we do not have time to scrutinise it to the degree to which it ought be scrutinised. However, with the scrutiny of this legislation demonstrated by myself and my staff, we found this error.
       </para>
       <para>
        We found that the relevant clause in the Bill was drafted in a way that would not do what the Minister had promised; to the contrary, it would do the exact opposite. It would disqualify anyone who went over the threshold due to the rearrangement of their income from being eligible for a fringe benefits card. I do not know whether we were supposed to rely on the Minister's promise, but given the way promises are broken by this Government, I would not like to have been a pensioner hoping that I would retain my entitlement card.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can just picture the Minister's face when he found out that the legal section of his own Department had drafted the Bill in a way that overturned his own promise, but thankfully we picked up the error. We informed the Minister who demanded that the problem be fixed immediately. When the Government moves amendments to rectify this problem during the committee stage, I will comment further about the drafting problems with current social security legislation. At this stage, I just wish to reiterate the Opposition's concerns about this hastily conceived promise, the way in which it was implemented and the fact that it has now created different classes of people with the same income receiving different benefits.

         —That is precisely what I am talking about. I have said in here before and repeat for the record that it would be wrong to implement a major reform such as this, which by its very nature must create a fair degree of fear and trepidation in the elderly community, and then attempt to have that community even worse off and even more worried and confused by ripping fringe benefits off it. However, we are working very hard to ensure that we can get a nationally agreed system of fringe benefits and that the Commonwealth can come to an arrangement with the States to see it implemented. Only one State is giving us any real difficulty on that score. I am referring, of course, to New South Wales. Perhaps Senator Patterson can use some of her influence on her Liberal Party colleagues in that State to get them to do the right thing. I believe that if we do not get a proper national system we will have a disaster.

       <para>
        In terms of Senator Patterson's other remark about who we blamed before computers came in, for a department that is making in excess of 100 million payments a year to four million people, the idea that the massive amount of computer programming that entails can never make an error is a nonsense. There must occasionally be errors. We seek to minimise them. We are seeking to upgrade the equipment all the time and to upgrade the programming to try to make sure that errors do not occur. To pretend that errors would never occur in a system of that size, irrespective of who administered it, is a nonsense. I believe that the record is excellent. When compared with the program delivery, the number of those errors has been very small indeed.

        Most of what Senator Lees referred to is not actually in the Bill. I am not quite sure what I should say about those comments. For all those like Senator Lees who think that in some way getting the disability Bill referred to a committee will give those affected time to consider it, I should say that I have been with officers of the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled this afternoon. They are keen to see this legislation passed and implemented. The disabled community itself has given a great deal of support to this Bill and takes a different view from that of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). I would have thought that if we are going to look at who among community groups is actually representing the disabled, we cannot go past their own organisations. They are, by and large, in support of this package. I know that there are those in the Australian Democrats and those in ACOSS who have an absolute view that giving some of these people the opportunity to work is not a good thing. I am not in accord with Senator Lees's views on this and, I hasten to point out, neither are the organisations which represent the disabled. They welcome this package and they reiterated that to me today.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to Senator Alston's comments. I do not want to address everything Senator Alston was saying, but he did speak about the Opposition's concerns about special benefits being extended to those persons granted two-year conditional entry permits. There are a few points to make on this issue. Persons with these new permits will not be automatically eligible for special benefit, because the payment of special benefit is subject to pretty stringent hardship and income tests. I will not go through what those tests are; we are all aware of them. As the new permits include permission to work, most of the time the special benefit will be paid subject to claim and satisfying Job Search allowance conditions. So I think Senator Alston's fundamental concern has already been addressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation prohibits the backdating of the payment of special benefit. It literally prohibits it, so I do not think we will see too much in the way of any new loopholes opened here. The earliest the payment can commence is when an application is lodged. Most importantly when we are looking at this new category and extension of special benefit, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be undertaking a very intensive screening of the process in assessing eligibility for these new permits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process is exactly the same as that for assessing eligibility for permanent residence, but the grant for permanent residence is conditional upon the relationship being genuine and continuing over two years. In the opinion of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and that is what one must refer to in looking at this, 95 per cent-the great majority-of those issued with permits will be eligible for permanent residence at the end of the two-year conditional period. I am not convinced that there is any problem to be addressed.

        That is the Government's view. Obviously, we will be happy to amend the legislation to take account of the matter to which Senator Lees referred.

I simply repeat to the Opposition and the Australian Democrats that I do not believe this will be in the interests of good government, but it is not the end of the world and we will live with it if we have to.

         —I appreciate Senator Richardson's acknowledgment of our finding of the technical error. As I said in my contribution to the second reading debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) Bill 1991, if the original, flawed clause 41 been allowed to pass through the Senate, it would have meant that anyone who rearranged their income between the Budget and 1 March 1991 to comply with the deeming arrangements and went over the fringe benefits threshold could have lost the fringe benefits entitlement, had the Government so chosen. The result of the original clause would have been exactly that which would have occurred if the Minister had not promised to protect pensioners' fringe benefits entitlements from the effects of deeming.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        All pensioners in Australia were informed in March 1991 that their fringe benefits would not be affected by the deeming provisions, yet the Department of Social Security has drafted legislation in such a way that would have exactly the opposite effect. This is either an extremely incompetent piece of drafting-so incompetent that it could be picked up at the drop of a hat by virtually any bush lawyer-or it was a deliberate attempt to overturn the Minister's promise that pensioners' fringe benefits would not be affected by deeming. I am generous enough to presume that it was an oversight.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a prime example of where sloppy or incompetent drafting can have a marked effect on the implementation of policy. If this error had not been identified, a significant number of pensioners could have lost their fringe benefit entitlement. With all due respect to the Minister who said that he does not actually have an army, it looks like an army from this side of the chamber when he has three staff members. It is an army that has a lot more experience than my small battalion.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not the first time that the Government's social security initiatives from the last Budget have been besieged by drafting problems. Last year, the Government inadvertently set the deeming threshold at $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples. Earlier this year, it was discovered that a drafting error in the same Bill prevented the Department from collecting tax file numbers from a wide range of beneficiaries. Then, in the first Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill earlier this year, the funeral bond provisions were drafted in a way that would have allowed withdrawal of moneys by a spouse contrary to the intentions of the Bill. We discussed this in my office and, unfortunately, did not do what we did this time and notify the Minister. We thought we were aware of a bungle. This time when we saw the bungle, we notified the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is inappropriate to make scapegoats of the drafters in the Department of Social Security or the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. We know and we accept, given this Government's ridiculous program, that they are working to very difficult deadlines which are forced upon them by the Government's legislative schedule. Ultimately, the blame rests with the Government because it is not providing its own drafters or the Senate committees with sufficient time to scrutinise its legislation effectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are the drafting errors that we have picked up. It would be a courageous person who would claim with any degree of confidence that there are not other errors which have escaped the scrutiny of the drafters and the Senate. It again confirms my belief of the importance of the role of this place, that we have the time to scrutinise legislation to ensure that it is less likely to be subjected to unintended consequences. We must remember that at the end of the day, the people who are affected are the ordinary people, in this case, pensioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        I appreciate that the Minister has responded. I appreciate the Minister's letter to me and his comments in the chamber. I hope that more attention will be paid to this matter so that we do not have these sorts of legislative errors.

         —I did indicate that the Opposition will be opposing clauses 4 and 10 and it may be appropriate for them to be voted on together. Otherwise, we will not be opposing the remainder of the Bill. I take the opportunity to explore with the Minister some of the comments made by Senator Lees in relation to waiting periods. Senator Lees was trying to suggest that the Australian Democrats were sympathetic to farmers and those in rural areas. I think we are all acutely aware of the fact that the Democrats are the party that would punish those in rural areas more than anyone else in this Parliament.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is very hypocritical for Senator Lees, on the one hand, to wander around rural areas pretending that somehow farmers are suffering from various elements in the social security legislation when, on the other hand, her colleague Senator Spindler is running around with a hit list which amounts to additional taxes of the order of $7 billion. These would involve increased excises on petrol and diesel fuel; a levy on all domestic road freight movements; changes in pay as you earn deduction procedures to impose further burdens on employers, particularly farmers; increases in company taxes for companies grossing in excess of $100,000, which is virtually every company that is able to keep its head above water; and taxing trusts as companies but, of course, making special arrangements for trade unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have thought that by now farmers ought to understand that this is a wolf in sheep's clothing, if ever there was one. The Australian Democrats are the party in the Parliament which is proposing to extend the capital gains tax to family homes worth more than $500,000. The Democrats are trying in all sorts of ways to make sure that any farmer who is still alive would not survive for much longer if this sort of silly agenda were ever implemented. We all know that it will not be implemented and we all know that the Democrats will never get their hands on the levers. But I think Senator Lees at least owes it to the rural community to explain how she can, on the one hand, simply go around wringing her hands and saying that she feels sorry for farmers and yet, on the other hand, have an agenda which is viciously anti-farmer.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have only to look at Senator Lees's own State where the Democrats would propose a 40 per cent increase in the alcohol excise and speculate what effect that might have on the wine industry in South Australia. There is a whole raft of proposals which are designed not only to ensure that farmers' incomes are significantly reduced but also to tax out of existence any of those who are still surviving. Proposals that involve wealth and inheritance taxes, closing down the live sheep export industry and almost any other productive rural activity give the lie to the concern that is being expressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not mind Senator Lees being critical in a whole range of areas but I think the honest thing to do is point out the pluses and minuses of the Democrats' approach. It is simply hypocritical double standards to, on the one hand, allow Senator Lees to get away with that sort of nonsense but, on the other hand, not come clean about what her colleague has in mind.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having got that off my chest, I ask the Minister a question. Does the Government think the Democrats' suggestion-which echoes the views of bodies such as the Australian Council of Social Service and the Victorian Council of Social Service-that waiting periods ought to be reduced, I think, pretty much across the board, contains some inherent logic? Should we have a shorter waiting period in times of economic difficulty? In a sense, the corollary of that would be that we would be entitled to have a longer waiting period in times of economic progress.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would be interested in the Minister's response. It seems to me that there would be the insuperable political difficulty of reinstating a longer waiting period when someone had made the hard judgment that the economy had recovered. Apart from that, I have a difficulty in terms of the logic behind that position. If one can justify having waiting periods, what difference does it make whether there is a recession? I would be interested to hear the Minister's response.

If one accepts that a recession is a time of economic hardship-and I do not think we will go into whether we have two consecutive quarters of negative growth-that is why we have hardship provisions. I can recall outlining in the Senate a couple of weeks ago not only what the hardship provisions were but also how they were applied. I pointed out that the Department of Social Security has taken a fairly liberal view of applications for hardship provisions. We have taken a compassionate view and where evidence exists, waiting periods are waived. So I do not think we should change the waiting period; it is just a matter of how we react to a time of hardship with the use of the hardship provisions. I defend the way in which the Department has implemented those provisions over the course of, say, the last six to nine months when economic times were obviously turning towards hardship.

        I am faced, however, with the same problem I had in answering a question from Senator Lees at Question Time today. I still do not exclude the possibility that there might be certainly one anomaly in waiting periods that we did not intend at the time. Therefore, I cannot say that I will not be doing anything about changes in waiting periods in the Budget. But as a principle I do not accept that, because times are tougher, we change waiting periods.

         —I am indebted to the Minister for that explanation. What view does the Minister take of the proposition that there are very many people who are finding that the nominal one week waiting period is in practice often extended to three weeks? I presume that means that at the end of three weeks those people are getting backdated payments, so in effect they are getting two weeks. I would be interested in whatever the Government can provide on the magnitude of this problem. It has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions and complaints have been made that many people are, in practice, being required to wait not one but three weeks. I presume that is simply a function of administration. It may be caused by an increased demand during the period of the recession, but if it is the fact we ought to know the extent of the difficulty. I invite the Minister to make some inquiries and perhaps report back on the magnitude of the problem.

         —I wish to respond, as I was invited to by Senator Alston, to the nonsense he has just put. First and foremost, I stand by the need to totally review the Australian taxation system. We need an equitable and just tax system. The problem in this country is definitely in the area of who pays. Who is now paying the burden of taxation? It is the middle to low income earners, particularly the pay as you earn taxpayers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The plan of the Australian Democrats is for a tax system that taxes those people who can afford to pay. We certainly are not proposing a broad based consumption tax-as Senator Alston is-that will tax everyone right across the board and will tax such things as medical and dental services, which at the moment do not attract any tax at all, regardless of a person's income. The Democrats stand by the tax package we are in the process of developing. A couple of the taxes mentioned by Senator Alston probably will be on the agenda, but I stress that the tax policies of the Democrats will tax those who can afford to pay. At the moment, farmers in this country not only cannot afford to pay taxes but also are having great difficulty in surviving.

        Returning to what we are supposed to be discussing, we will not be supporting the two amendments moved by the Opposition. As I highlighted in my speech, we do not believe that these amendments will do anything other than close what was hopefully an unforeseen hole that people would simply fall into if they happened to fit into a particular category-in other words, close off the possibility where people in this country, as the Minister has said, the vast majority of them preparing to become Australian citizens, find themselves through no fault of their own with absolutely no income. Therefore, we will be supporting the Bill.

        I take the opportunity to ask the Minister whether he could give us the number of people per year who would fall into the category of coming into this country, finding themselves in a situation where they urgently needed assistance and needing special benefits.

        The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991, which is now before the chamber contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill gives effect to the tariff changes announced as part of the Ministerial Statement-Building a Competitive Australia. The Bill also contains some amendments which have previously been introduced as customs tariff proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major tariff changes announced on the twelfth day of March 1991 fulfil the Government's commitment to continue, beyond 1992, the tariff reforms initiated in 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The importance of these changes is the certainty that this announcement will provide to the importing community in setting the tariff regime for the foreseeable future.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill contains measures relating to general tariff rates, measures for the specific industry sectors of agriculture, passenger motor vehicles and textile, clothing and footwear.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments to the general manufacturing ad valorem rates implement phased reductions to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996 for tariffs greater than 5 per cent at 1 July 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will continue to reduce the disparities in the effective rates of assistance between Australian industries, further flatten the tariff, encourage rationalisation of less efficient activities and reduce input costs to other trade-exposed sectors of the economy. Changes are also proposed for the preferential tariff arrangements for Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan Province and the Republic of Korea. From 1 July 1992 the tariff rates for these countries will be frozen.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the general tariff rate reaches or passes the frozen rate the general rate will apply. This action recognises the rapid improvement in their economic situation, and the widening disparity among countries traditionally considered to be ``developing''. This disparity creates differing needs for international trade assistance by way of preferential treatment. The United States recently recognised this in their ``graduation'' of these four countries from preference arrangements. The amendments in this Bill will be consistent with these moves, and with the original purpose of preferential arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        In any case, the freezing of tariffs applying to these countries will ensure that no tariff rates will increase for them. Some preference will continue to be available until the general tariff rate phases down to the rate applying to developing countries at the start of the freeze. Where the general tariff rate remains unchanged, these countries will continue to enjoy the 5 per cent preference margin.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also decided to convert fixed and composite tariff rates to ad valorem equivalents wherever possible and consistent with Australia's international obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        These tariffs will be reduced in line with the general reductions in tariffs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tariff assistance for agricultural industries will phase down after 1992 at the same rate as the general manufacturing sector, to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996, with the following exceptions:
       </para>
       <para>
        * Vegetable products (which are phasing down to a tariff of 10 per cent by 1 July 1994) will continue to phase down at the same rate as the general manufacturing sector, to 5 per cent by 1 January 1998.

        Accordingly, it is proposed to adjust the specific tariff rate for raw and refined sugar to $76 per tonne at 1 July 1991 and to $55 per tonne at 1 July 1992. By maintaining a specific tariff rate, the Sugar Industry will remain protected in the event of low world prices over this period.

        The Government's decision to accelerate TCF tariff reductions is aimed at bringing TCF assistance more into line with the rest of manufacturing while recognising the special adjustment problems within the sector.

        The pace of restructuring since the current plan was announced in 1986 has not been sufficient. Protection levels have remained very high. This has tended to attract resources into the least efficient areas of production and has negated any incentive for the industries to restructure and become internationally competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the current plan would have made significant reductions in protection by 1995, TCF assistance would still be much higher than that currently programmed to apply industry-wide. The tariff quota system in particular has tended to counteract reductions in protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes incorporated in this Bill are designed to encourage the development of a more internationally competitive TCF sector which will be viable with lower levels of community support. Australian consumers stand to benefit from better products at cheaper prices. Economy wide effects will accrue from the more efficient allocation of resources.

         —The principal amendments proposed by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 and the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which we have agreed are allied Bills, serve to dismantle some fundamental structures of Australian protectionism. In principle, the coalition supports their thrust and direction. However, while we agree with the general thrust of the Government's proposals in these two Bills-indeed, the coalition set the agenda last year when it called for phased reductions of all industry protection to, at most, negligible levels by the year 2000-the Government has failed to deliver the other side of the reform ledger which we say is an absolutely vital and important component; they have to go together.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The failure to deliver micro-economic reform will mean that thousands of enterprises, faced with lower assistance, will not be able to meet the challenge of increased international competition. It must be made clear that the Government, by not balancing this ledger-and I am talking about the waterfront, industrial relations, telecommunications and transport; the list goes on-has broken its commitment to industry to tackle other reform areas which would ensure cost reductions and give it a better opportunity to compete on world markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to address my remarks to the Bills under debate. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill legislates protection cuts announced in the 12 March statement as well as several other tariff changes announced recently. In broad terms, the effect of the major amendments will be to phase down certain general ad valorem tariff rates by 1996; phase down tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and original equipment components; phase down textile, clothing and footwear tariffs; allow duty free importation of goods designed for minerals processing which are not made in Australia; allow duty free importation of goods used in the construction, modification and repair of ships greater than 150 gross construction tons; lower the tariff rate for raw and refined sugar; freeze tariff rates applying to certain imported goods from Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea until the general tariff rate is down to the tariff rate of those goods; allow the duty free importation of invalid carriages, defibrillators and pacemakers; and raise the tender quota allocations of most textile, clothing and footwear goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition supports the proposed general tariff reductions to bring virtually all manufacturing tariffs to 5 per cent by July 1996. This is in line with our announcement last year to reduce all industry protection to, at most, negligible levels by the end of the century. However, we again stress-and it is vital to make this point-that our commitment included an equally absolute commitment to tackle micro-economic reforms so that industry would be given the opportunity to meet the challenge of lower industry assistance. We will be moving an amendment to urge the Government to reconsider this unbalanced approach. It is much in line with the imbalance that we now have with the financial markets deregulated but the labour markets not deregulated. One arm of supply and demand cannot be deregulated without the other.

         —No, you cannot. The whole thrust of the coalition's policy to reduce tariffs is to do it consistently with, and at the same time as, micro-economic reform to address the cost factors, as Senator Boswell referred to them, of goods and production.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill also implements announced tariff reductions for the automotive and textile, clothing and footwear sectors. Broadly speaking, the automotive sector tariff will be phased down from 35 per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000. In the textile, clothing and footwear sector, quotas will be abolished two years ahead of schedule, and the tariff level applying by the year 2000 will be 25 per cent for most clothing, 15 per cent for footwear and fabrics and 10 per cent for footwear parts and certain non-quota goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the coalition will not oppose these reductions, our preference is to remove all special industry arrangements by the end of the century. In other words, these two sectors should receive the same level of assistance as the rest of the manufacturing industry by the year 2000, given that a coalition government will implement much needed micro-economic reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        On a more positive note, the Government has adopted the coalition's proposal to freeze the developing country preference rate for the so-called newly industrialised countries of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Korea. Their preference will be frozen, and as the general tariff rate falls the preference margin will also fall until it reaches zero. The general tariff rate will then apply to these countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other changes included in this Bill are the expanded duty free provisions for the importation of capital equipment which the coalition supports. It also supports a range of other proposed changes for the duty free importation of aluminised steel used in the manufacture of automotive muffler exhaust systems, duty free entry of wheelchairs, defibrillators, heart pacemakers, printed circuit boards, machine tools and parts for working advanced materials.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the steel used for the manufacture of automotive exhaust systems, I am pleased to see that this Bill provides for that change of policy. In May last year, in one of my first acts as a senator, I represented a small South Australian manufacturing company which was severely disadvantaged by the fact it could not obtain its raw material and as a result was disadvantaged in the marketplace. As the Minister's press statement says, Australian car manufacturers have made it clear that a local product did not meet the needs of muffler exhaust systems manufacturers. He said that the Government believed its action would reduce the manufacturers' raw material costs and would improve the market competitiveness of their mufflers. Of course, that will have a flow-on effect for the Australian vehicle building industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I first made representations on 30 May, and we now see in this Bill that measure implemented. In this instance it will give a South Australian motor vehicle manufacturer, Walker Australia Pty Ltd, the opportunity to be competitive within the Australian market and, hopefully, more competitive on international markets. I certainly welcome that change. It is a move in the right direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Customs Bill also implements the proposed textile, clothing and footwear import credit scheme which is a somewhat less generous version of the automotive industry's export facilitation scheme. This Bill establishes the by-law to allow duty free entry of goods under the scheme. An amendment will be moved to delete this new by-law because the coalition, as a matter of principle, opposes the extension of the export credit schemes beyond the car industry. The only reason we accept continuation of export facilitation in that industry is that it is there and it would be too disruptive to withdraw it now. Moreover, as the tariff falls, so too will the amount of export subsidy involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition is moving the amendment because it considers such export facilitation arrangements are generally undesirable because they can add yet another layer of distortion. The whole thrust of this legislation is to start withdrawing or removing some of these distortions in the marketplace and in the manufacturing arena. Distortions may be reduced within the industry between importers and exporters, but the overwhelming problem is that distortions are exacerbated between exporters in the target industries and exporters in other industries. This is the reason the Industry Commission opposes such schemes in principle.
       </para>
       <para>
        Everyone agrees now that the major cost of import protection is the effective tax imposed on exports. Exporters are not only forced to pay higher prices for protected inputs but, of more concern, they are compelled to pay higher prices for factors of production such as labour and capital, the prices of which are bid up by the protected sectors. Of course, not only exporters bear these higher costs but exporters cannot pass them on into higher consumer prices-they must compete with world prices on world markets. The only real solution to the problem is to get rid of the import protection, and this process is now under way with bipartisan support and the general thrust of this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        But others suggest some form of tariff compensation which broadly compensates exporters for the costs of import protection. In theory this could be achieved but in practice these schemes rarely compensate on a non-distorting basis and, of course, the administrative costs of such schemes become prohibitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this light, the proposed textile, clothing and footwear imports credit scheme is a sort of halfway house. Import protection is coming down in the industry but obviously the Government feels this is not enough to encourage exporters. Therefore, it is proposing a scheme which will allow exporters initially to earn import credits to the value of 30c for every dollar of exports, which will phase down to 15c. Whilst this is more modest than the export facilitation program in the car industry, the principle, however, is the same.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much has already been made of the Industry Commission's recommendation to continue export facilitation in the car industry. It has been written up as a major change in direction of that body away from economic purity and an endorsement of pragmatic and selective export encouragement. Clearly, these commentators have not read the Commission's report. The Commission's decision was delicately poised. It concluded that `export facilitation is resulting in a less efficient allocation of resources between industries than would otherwise occur' and that this must be balanced against any gain in efficiency of resource use within the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ultimately, its decision to recommend continuation of the scheme rested on its assessment that the scheme had been in place for some 10 years and its removal would impose adjustment costs on top of those which would flow from further reduction in tariffs. Moreover, as the tariff fell, the amount of export subsidy would dwindle. The Commission was at pains to stress that this recommendation did not signal general endorsement of such schemes. It summed up:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission does not view export facilitations a desirable policy instrument in its own right . . . the costs of tariff protection to exporters and others are best addressed by focussing on reducing that protection as part of the broader program of microeconomic reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        For these reasons, the coalition will move to oppose the establishment of the textile, clothing and footwear imports credits scheme. In due course, I will certainly commend that amendment to this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to raise a matter which I hope the duty Minister, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), will take up with the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) in due course. Hopefully, we might get some answers from the Government at the committee stage. It has come to our attention that draft guidelines for various TCF programs, including the import credits scheme, have been circulated on a selective basis to certain companies. I would think that this would be in normal contravention of government practice. Clearly, selected companies would have a head start if they knew what the ground rules were. In addition to that, to the extent that their comments are taken into account, presumably the final guidelines will cater for their needs to the exclusion of firms which are not on this selective list and which have not looked at the guidelines before they are drawn up and put into place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, the Opposition is of the view that such practice is an almost inevitable by-product of such bureaucratic and administratively complex schemes as the import credits scheme. Such schemes are prone to the arbitrary selection of winners because they reward those who can or have the time to work the system. We will take this matter up with the Minister at the committee stage to ascertain whether the selective circulation of proposed guidelines was a mistake or whether it is the normal course that is followed. A number of questions will flow from that. We will seek that clarification from the Minister and his officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill essentially complements the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill amending six bounty Acts, giving effect to the announcements made in the 12 March statement. It proposes to phase down the bounty rates applying to various industries; widen the scope of certain bounty schemes; and require certain minimum annual production levels to be met to be eligible for certain bounties.

        A major provision of the Bill which the coalition supports includes the phasing out of textile bounties. The post-1988 textile and clothing footwear plan proposed to reduce textile yarn bounties to 30 per cent by 1992 and to maintain them at that rate until 1995. It is now proposed that they be phased out completely by June 1995, with a 5 per cent tariff to apply thereafter. The bounty on textile printing will also phase out by June 1995 but will not be replaced by a tariff. The bed sheeting bounty, which was to wind up next year, is to be extended three years, but it will also phase to zero by 30 June 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of other changes will be made to the textile yarns bounty following a review of the Textile Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, including the removal of the 30 per cent uplift factor on value added for bounty on export sales; the exclusion of beaming, warping and sizing processes; the deregistration of companies which fail to make a bounty claim within 12 months of the financial year; and the introduction of a minimum bounty threshold of $10,000. Savings from the accelerated phase down of the three textile bounties are expected to total $56m over the three years to 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also serves to provide for the continuation of bounty assistance for local production of certain metal working machine tools and robots. This bounty, due to expire in June 1991, is now to be extended until 30 June 1997, with bounty rates progressively phasing down to 5 per cent by 1996 in line with the rest of the manufacturing industry. In addition, the bounty's coverage is to be widened to cater for current and prospective advances in the area of processing technology for new materials, with imports of these products to be duty-free. Bounty will only be paid to firms achieving in-house value-added bountiful production of at least $200,000 per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition supports the extension of the bounty at reduced rates, as this is consistent with our policy of gradual predictable reductions in industry protection. The Bill also proposes the extension of the coverage of the computer bounty to incorporate the manufacture of printed circuit boards from 1 July 1991. At the same time, the tariff on these items will be removed. The higher cost of the bounty is expected to be offset by a proposed reduction in scheduled bounty rates. The coalition does not oppose the broadening of the computer bounty to include printed circuit boards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bounties are generally less distorting than tariffs, and this change, coupled with the proposed reduction in the bounty rate, will not require additional appropriations. In addition, the Bill also serves to require certain minimal annual production levels to be met to be eligible for certain bounties. It proposes minimum annual threshold levels into the bounty schemes for books, computers, metal working machine tools, robots, textiles, yarns, bed sheeting and printed fabrics.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition opposes the introduction of, or increases in, minimum thresholds in bounty schemes, and amendments will be moved to delete these provisions. In this Bill the Government is proposing to insert into the six bounty Acts minimum annual thresholds for payment of the bounty, in most cases $10,000. In one case-that of the book bounty-it was proposing to increase the threshold from $500 to $2,000 per title, but the Government changed its mind, because we understand that the change would have affected many participants in the industry, and agreed to accept in the House of Representatives a coalition amendment to restore the original limit. While welcoming the Government's change of heart on that bounty, the coalition remains of the view that all thresholds should be withdrawn. We do so for a number of reasons.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government claims the principal reason for introducing the thresholds is to promote efficient industrial development, not to make savings on bounty payments. Indeed, it does not claim that any significant savings will be made and no estimate of financial impact is provided in the second reading speech to the Bill, although total savings of $1m a year were claimed in the 12 March statement. By improved industrial development, one must assume that the Government means fewer and larger firms. The coalition, however, is of the view that excluding access to the bounty on the basis of size is arbitrary and could reduce the amount of competition in the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In any event, why should small business not have the same access as big business? Small business is struggling out there to make ends meet and why should it not have `the level playing field' with big business as it relates to this particular area? Let me read into the record a letter from a small business which drew to the Minister's attention the problem created by this particular proposal. This letter is from the Managing Director of Syntech Automation Pty Ltd in relation to working machines and robots. It says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The subject Act was due to expire in 1991, and it is to the Government's credit that it has been decided to extend the term to 1997.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there is a major shortcoming in the provisions in the new Act relating to the size of the companies which can benefit from the Bounty, in that to be eligible for the Bounty the applicant company must have a value added in excess of $200,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our company is a small one employing fifteen people and with a turnover of $1,200,000. Of this total turnover approximately $200,000 would be classed as value added, based on 1990/91 results. In a poor economy with low turnover we face the possibility of being ineligible for Bounty in 1991/92.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can also become ineligible because a lot of the work we do is not covered by the Bounty because it does not fall within the description of ``metal working'', even though much is used in the metal industry e.g., an automatic tyre inflating machine for a major car maker. Any variation in the mix of work we do could make us ineligible even in a buoyant economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        This company attempts to compete with imported machinery, and in the last twelve months we have produced import replacement capital equipment to the value of $250,000 (at import cost). This has required a high level of technical and commercial risk, which is partially offset by the Bounty which is offered.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal to implement a $200,000 floor will disadvantage smaller companies like ourselves, in favour of a very few larger companies. There is a large gap between companies of our size, and the next size level of engineering automation houses, and the smaller companies account for a large percentage of the automation carried out in this industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, that letter from Syntech puts it in a proper perspective. What the Government is proposing by its legislative direction is to restrict, inhibit and discriminate against small business operators in this country. Not only does small business have to reach its $200,000 value-added in tough economic circumstances that might make it ineligible in the next financial year to be able to claim that support-not of its own doing, I hasten to add, but because of the recession we had to have-but also it is being penalised simply because it is daring to suffer the impact of a recession and daring to attempt to grow and prosper. It is now being inhibited because of the direction contained in the legislation. For that reason, we will be seeking to remove those limits.
       </para>
       <para>
        We concede that there is a valid argument that industry assistance, whether through tariffs or bounties, perhaps encourages industry fragmentation. Indeed, this has been one of the very visible and significant costs of industry protection in this country. It is an inevitable by-product which is yet another reason why industry protection should be phased out. Undesirable though fragmentation may be, we consider it is an impossible task to determine who are the potentially efficient manufacturers who should receive assistance and who should not. The only solution is to get rid of the assistance. Happily, this Bill certainly moves in that direction.

       <para>
        One could ask why the Government is introducing these thresholds now so late in the life of the bounty schemes. At least its argument would have been stronger and a little more consistent a few years ago. The coalition has seriously considered the arguments put by the Government but we consider that the balance of argument weighs in favour of our amendments. On the surface, and especially from an administrator's point of view, many small bounty payments must seem too small to be of any significance, but the danger of reducing competition in any form is too large to ignore, especially if new entrants are discouraged. Moreover, departmental officers suggest that these targeted small operators will continue without bounty. I think that is ignoring the real marketplace and the real economic circumstances out there in that marketplace now. That suggests that they are efficient and, whilst they may not need bounty, we do not see how the introduction of the thresholds can then be based on grounds of promoting industry efficiency. If this is the case, it is just a case of saving money, which is worth while but not apparently the aim of the changes as identified and proposed by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we understand the threshold mechanism, as bounty rates fall the impact of the fixed dollar bounty thresholds will be effectively increased. For example, if a bounty is currently 20 per cent and a threshold is $10,000, then a firm needs to generate $50,000 of eligible production costs. When the bounty rate is 10 per cent, then $100,000 of costs must be generated. Smaller production units, and therefore smaller companies, will have the bounty drop out ahead of their larger competitors as bounty rates phase down, hence the very significant growing discriminatory disadvantage to small firms. In the case of the computer bounty, which is phasing down by two percentage points a year, the amount of value added required to be generated will increase from around $60,000 now to $125,000 by 1994, when the bounty will be 8 per cent. This effective increase in the threshold clearly exceeds the expected inflation rate, although perhaps the Government knows something about the levers it will adjust over the next year or two that we do not know about.

I hope that the Minister will confirm whether it is the case that the effective thresholds will increase significantly as bounty rates fall and whether this effect is intended, because it is not alluded to in the second reading speech and has a dramatic and disadvantageous effect for smaller companies. We would also be interested to hear what impact the Government expects this to have on bounty recipients and future bounty payments.

        In summary, the coalition's opposition to these changes fits in with our longstanding opposition to similar arbitrary provisions in other bounty schemes-for example, orderly development provisions of the shipbuilding bounty schemes or our opposition to the minimum volume sanction in the car plan. Essentially, it is a case of our believing that efficiency is better served by letting the market sort out the most efficient structure, which, of course, will continually change, in a low assistance environment-not with arbitrary requirements, no matter how well-intentioned they may be-provided that coupled with these changes come substantial micro-economic reforms to ensure that people can effectively adjust with these changes over a period to remain in the marketplace and to be viable, effective companies employing Australians generating goods in Australia for import replacement programs and being able to access, therefore, the international marketplace. Only when we get that equation right will we ensure the growth and prosperity of companies and small firms in particular in this country, and only in that way will we ensure a reduction in the dole queues.

         —The Senate is considering the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and the Customs Amendment Bill 1991. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is the largest of these Bills; indeed, it is one of the largest of its type ever considered by this Parliament and probably the most far-reaching.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill proposes to implement the proposals outlined by Senator Button on 12 March, and also some measures already introduced as customs tariff proposals. The measures announced in the Government's industry statement signal an end to the protectionist infant industry experiment which has been conducted in Australia for almost the whole of this century. Put broadly, this theory predicted that a competitive, efficient and mature industry could be created by establishing a tariff structure which allowed domestic industries to survive for an establishment period. Over time, the protective tariff wall would be removed after giving the industry time to get established and to gain the necessary skills to survive international competition. As well, Australia's extreme isolation and the consequent transportation costs tended to provide a natural protective element where local raw materials were used in the manufacturing process, but this is no longer the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, the subsequent exposure to international competition usually did not occur; indeed, successive governments often increased the rate of tariff protection to suit the short term interests prevailing at the time. This often had detrimental effects on performance in other sectors, such as increasing primary production costs. Because of the dire straits in which Australia now finds itself, the protective tariff walls are being removed. In 1988 the Government announced and began implementing a major phased reduction in both specific and general tariffs. It has recently delivered a major statement which proposes to continue, and in some cases accelerate, the tariff reductions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concept of tariff reductions is an inviting one. The price of goods would fall, which obviously benefits consumers. In addition, the consumer price index would be lowered, thereby dampening the measured inflation rate. To the extent to which the tariffs apply to business inputs, there would be a benefit to local producers which would hopefully boost their competitiveness. However, there is also the problem of the effect that these changes would have on the work force currently producing the goods which enjoy the tariffs. The brunt of any restructuring will fall on the employees in the passenger motor vehicle and the textile, clothing and footwear industries. These are large industries employing tens of thousands of people. These industries also have very important regional significance. For example, the Geelong region in Victoria will be very heavily affected if the large scale rationalisation of the motor vehicle building industry occurs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequently the Australian Democrats are most concerned that adequate retraining facilities be available to those displaced by the tariff cuts. The Government announced some retraining measures in its March industry statement, but the funds to be set aside appear to be woefully inadequate to deal with the estimated job losses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before addressing these problems, it is appropriate to detail exactly what the Bill proposes to do to tariffs. The general ad valorem rate on manufactured goods will be phased down to 15 per cent or lower by July 1992. The Bill proposes to continue this reduction so that all these goods will be subject to a 5 per cent rate by 1 July 1996. There will be five annual reductions which will reduce rates by 1 per cent or 2 per cent for goods currently subject to 10 per cent and 15 per cent duties respectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tariff assistance for agricultural industries will also phase down to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996, except for vegetable products which will reach the 5 per cent rate by 1 January 1998. The post-1992 arrangements for the dairy, sugar and tobacco-growing industries will be determined by a current Industry Commission inquiry. However, the Bill also proposes to adjust the existing specific tariff rate for raw and refined sugar and for related products. The proposed new rates of $76 per ton from 1 July 1991 and $55 per ton from 1 July 1992 would replace the existing rates of $95 per ton and $76 per ton respectively. This is described in the second reading speech of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) as bringing the sugar industry `back within the spirit of the 1988 decision to reduce general tariffs to a maximum of 15 per cent ad valorem equivalent by 1 July 1992'.
       </para>
       <para>
        These existing rates were insisted upon by the Senate in 1989 after the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology conducted an inquiry into assistance for the sugar industry. We have not been convinced that the current arrangements are in any way deficient and we propose to amend the Bill to remove the proposed changes. It is very interesting to note that during the debate in the other place the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations, Mr Downer, claimed that the proposed level of tariff in this Bill was too high.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at what some of our competitors do to assist their sugar industries. Many countries provide a guaranteed price for the product their local producers supply. There is no doubt that these distortions, in the end, do more harm than good. The European Community's common agricultural policy costs European consumers hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars every year, apart from the indirect problems it causes to the efficient farmers in other countries, such as Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        France, for example, pays $809 per tonne for sugar. With a world price of $258 at the moment, that is a subsidy of $551 per ton. Compared with this, Thailand, with a subsidy of only $446 per ton and the United States, at only $356 per ton, look positively mean. These figures show how relatively efficient our Australian industry is. The tariff is being reduced. What is the rush? Why pre-empt the Industry Commission review?
       </para>
       <para>
        The textile, clothing and footwear and motor vehicle industries are special cases and have special arrangements applying to them. Tariffs on passenger motor vehicles will have dropped from around 100 per cent at the beginning of the car plan to 35 per cent by 1992. This Bill proposes to continue this reduction so that tariffs on cars and on original components will be at 15 per cent by the year 2000, although the rate on replacement components will remain at 15 per cent until it aligns with the general rate in the year 2000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industry Commission investigated the motor vehicle industry assistance arrangements and reported on a recommended course of action. The original draft report of the Commission recommended the reduction of tariffs for motor vehicles in four steps of 5 per cent to reach a 15 per cent rate by 1996. Due to the outcry this caused, the final report contained the eight-year phase-in period which has been adopted by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tariffs on light commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles and the components for these vehicles will be reduced from 15 per cent in line with general tariff reductions. The export facilitation scheme is to be expanded. Credits will be calculated on the basis of $1 for every dollar of Australian automotive value added in the local content of eligible exports. Ceilings on the level of export credits which plan participants can earn have been abolished, as have been the restrictions on the sale and the transferability of export credits.
       </para>
       <para>
        As well as other improvements, the arrangements are extended to allow for the inclusion of automotive machine tooling, automotive tooling and services relating to automotive design and production as eligible exports. Of course, the Government also announced another decision relating to the motor vehicle industry in the March statement. The decision to lower the luxury car tax is opposed by the Australian Democrats although, unfortunately, the legislation effecting the decision has already been passed by the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats can see little vision in the plan for our motor vehicle industry. Surely it is clear to everyone that the key to exporting cars in the 1990s and beyond will and indeed must be superior environmental performance. Many honourable senators will be aware of the clean air legislation which will apply in California at the end of this decade. This historic law provides that 2 per cent of new automobiles sold have to provide very low or zero emissions. Over time, this percentage will increase. Already, General Motors is working on the `impact' electric commuter car. No doubt other major manufacturers are doing similar research and development. Now is the time to put considerable research and development funds into an electric car industry in Australia. Ultimately, we may even be able to produce viable solar powered vehicles, although that is admittedly a very long term objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Government has completely ignored this direction when framing its newest car plan. We are not saying that any direct assistance is necessary for electric vehicles. The creation of an industry would be greatly bolstered by three general measures. First, a sales tax exemption could be provided to electrically powered vehicles. The Australian Democrats have proposed such an amendment to the Senate, but it has been defeated in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, we have no fuel efficiency policy. A minimum fuel economy standard was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in its report on reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect which was released in January of this year. The Committee recommended that a minimum fuel economy standard of eight litres per 100 kilometres be set for all new vehicles sold in Australia by 1998 and that this standard be reduced to six litres per 100 kilometres by 2005.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, we need a serious re-use and recycling policy for cars and their parts. Recent reports show that the German car manufacturer BMW is currently investigating the possibility of total recycling of all car parts by placing a deposit on vehicles. Not surprisingly, the German Government is also investigating the possibility of legislation to enforce this type of scheme. Again, we are in danger of being left behind.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government could and should intervene directly by the use of government purchasing policy to further influence the development of world class environmental standards. The Comcar fleet could and should be used to trial alternative clean transport options. State and local governments should also become involved to provide a market for alternative commuter vehicles.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes to implement the Government's revised plan for the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industries. The present plan for these industries was announced in 1986, came into full operation on 1 March 1989 and is scheduled to run until 1995. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority was established to revitalise the TCF industries and to ease the restructuring necessary to make these industries more competitive. The Authority released a state of the industry report in 1990 which concluded that any adjustment which had occurred up until that time was not related to the industry plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major adjustment pressures from the plan are expected to emerge over the next one to three years. This convinced the Government to accelerate and extend significantly the rate of tariff reduction in these sectors. The new arrangements will extend the end of the plan from 1995 to the year 2000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fortunately, the Bill also proposes to introduce an import credits scheme from 1 July 1991. Import credits will initially accrue at the rate of 30 per cent of the domestic value added of TCF exports and will phase down to 15 per cent over the period of the scheme. The credits can be used only to reduce tariffs on TCF imports and are freely transferable. The Democrats welcome this initiative. We do not share the view of the Opposition on this matter. In fact, we cannot understand how the Opposition can be committed to the abolition of all tariffs and yet not support a scheme which grants tariff exemptions on the basis of export performance. The scheme automatically phases down to 15 per cent of the domestic value added over its lifetime and has general industry support.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the export facilitation scheme is concerned, we would appreciate it if the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) could explain in his concluding remarks why the proposed scheme only grants import credits at the rate of 30 per cent when similar arrangements in the motor vehicle industry grant import credits at the rate of 100 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, all quotas will be terminated on 1 March 1993 and out-of-quota duty rates currently programmed for 1 March 1992 will be halved. The industry statement also promised to involve the Prices Surveillance Authority in monitoring the prices of TCF goods from the beginning of the implementation of the new phasing arrangements. The Australian Democrats welcome this move.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we have heard, the Bill also proposes to phase out the existing developing country preference for Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. The tariff preference arrangements are a development incentive which is provided by developed nations in order to assist developing nations in world trade. The preference is a flat 5 per cent reduction in whatever the relevant tariff would otherwise be. The reclassification of these four so-called `Asian tiger' nations is really just recognition of the fact that these countries are no longer in the underdeveloped world. It is in fact good news that this preference is no longer needed by these countries. Indeed, the trading performance of Taiwan, in particular, over the last decade has been quite amazing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The removal of the preference is very gentle. Existing rates will be frozen until the phasing arrangements which are currently in place or are to be instituted fall to the rates currently enjoyed by these four nations. Thereafter, the general tariff rate will apply to imports from these countries. This move is supported by the Democrats-indeed, my colleague Senator Spindler called for this measure to be included in the industry statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes to modify the duty free provisions for capital equipment. These measures should assist in the development of Australian industry by reducing fixed costs. This will assist in adding value to Australian resources by Australian industry. For many years the Australian Democrats have believed that much greater use should be made of financial disincentives to export unprocessed resources. Of course, the classic example in this regard is the destruction of our forests in order to provide woodchips to overseas pulp mills. We then import the high value-added paper products.

        This futile cycle could be discouraged by levying a tax on non-plantation woodchips which are exported.
       </para>
       <para>
        The specific exemptions to be granted under the Bill are for minerals processing equipment not ordinarily made in Australia; components for the repair, modification and construction of ships of greater than 150 gross construction tons; and certain printed circuit boards and machinery for working advanced materials which qualify for bounty assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, more capital equipment will attract the split consignment provisions which allow the importation of complete capital equipment or parts of this equipment in separate consignments at the rate of duty applying to the complete plant. The Australian Democrats also support these proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        As well as these historic measures which I have detailed, the Bill also deals with some amendments which have been previously introduced as customs tariff proposals. These relate to various matters, but I wish to discuss only two of them. First, the Government announced the abolition of the duty on wheelchairs, defibrillators and heart pacemakers as from 1 January 1991. The relevant rates are 17 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. This is a long overdue step which has been vigorously advocated by the Democrats for years. Indeed, just last year, Senator Spindler moved amendments to the customs tariff legislation to effect this policy. Those amendments were defeated last year, but the Democrats' persistence in the matter was rewarded by Senator Button's announcement by press release that the exemptions were to be granted. It is a great pity that this could not have happened earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final matter I wish to mention on this Bill is the indexation of the revenue duty rate on certain mixed spirituous beverages made from ethyl alcohol, wine and fruit juice. Apparently, this amendment is necessary to close a loophole which granted a huge market advantage to an imported beverage because of a very low rate of tax which arose because of the particular way the law is constructed. I am informed of one product-which apparently has the name `Nick-off'-to which this amendment is directed. I would appreciate it if the Minister could also explain to the Senate exactly what the situation is in regard to this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is an omnibus Bill which proposes amending five current bounty Acts pursuant to measures announced in the industry statement last March. The decision announced to alter the book bounty has been reversed by the House of Representatives, and we welcome that decision. The textile, clothing and footwear bounties are also to be altered as follows: the textile yarn bounty will be phased from 30 per cent value added on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995 and replaced by a five per cent tariff; the bed sheeting bounty will be extended to 30 June 1995 without review but will phase down from 16 per cent per square metre on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995; and the bounty on textile printing will phase down to zero by 1 July 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        The eligibility for bounty assistance will be withdrawn for the beaming, warping and sizing processes which occur before fabric production. Repeat winding is also to be excluded from eligibility. These alterations are expected to yield about $4m in savings annually. These amendments arise from the recommendations of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority into the administration of the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes to continue the existing bounty on machine tools and robots which would have otherwise expired on 30 June 1991. The bounty will now expire on 30 June 1997. The Bureau of Industry Economics conducted a review of this bounty and concluded that the scheme had been effective in maintaining a viable machine tool industry and encouraging industry restructuring into high technology areas, including the production of robots. In short, the targeted market intervention by the Government has been successful and we are happy to support the continuation of this program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The scheme is to be extended in a number of ways. First, the bounty's coverage will be extended into the area of processing technology for new materials such as ceramics, polymers and composite materials. As the Minister said in his second reading speech:
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst there is little local production at present in machine tools for the working of such advanced materials, this measure should encourage tooling in such areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        This playing field is being tilted towards future technology. This is not a strategy of picking winners but simply the mature recognition that industry will be heading in a particular direction and that Australia's best interests lie in us also following that direction. The bounty may make it worth while for Australian firms to undertake investments which would otherwise never be viable.

         —I take this opportunity to pay brief tribute to the successes that have finally been achieved by Eritrea and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front during the last month. I am sure that most honourable senators will be aware of the almost 30-year unbroken civil war that has been raging in the Horn of Africa. The Eritreans would not regard it as a civil war, because they have always maintained their right to independence and to secede from the federation which was imposed on them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not think that anyone thought the fall would be quite as dramatic or as complete as it has been in recent weeks. By the `fall' I refer to the much-publicised and well-celebrated departure of President Mengistu, who no doubt would have few rivals in a claim to being the bloodiest of Africa's dictators-on a par, I would have thought, with Idi Amin. The brutal rule of the Dergue over the last 17 years has meant that a tremendous rebuilding program will need to be undertaken both in Ethiopia and in those provinces to the north of Addis Ababa.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is particularly encouraging that the response, since the fall of Mengistu and the liberation of Addis, together with the success of the Eritreans in resuming control of Asmara, the capital, in many ways is the culmination of all of their dreams. Thomas Keneally's fine book Towards Asmara potently summarised the symbolic significance of Asmara in that context. The gaining of control of Assab, the port on the Red Sea, in conjunction with Massawa, means that the Eritreans now are totally in control of their own area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the most encouraging feature is that, even though when one reads various newspaper accounts and tries to analyse the texture of the regimes that are likely to come to government and the colour of the various fronts that have been waging war and one still sees that on the one hand they can be described as traditional Marxists and on the other as being very much aware of the limitations of Marxism, increasingly there are signs that they are not likely to fall into the same traps that have befallen most of the liberated countries in Africa and most of the independent countries in Africa, of which there are probably now some 48.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, I think it is promising to see the developments in recent days, particularly the talks in London, which appear to have resulted in all of the disparate groups agreeing that those independence talks ought to proceed and that there ought to be a referendum conducted in Addis Ababa and a separate referendum-an act of self-determination-for the people of Eritrea. It is of great significance also that the United States Government has indicated its support for such an act of self-determination. Certainly, that is the first time the United States has officially sanctioned Eritrea's call for a referendum.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the meantime, the Eritreans are prepared to accept an interim government, a nominally Marxist government of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front in Addis Ababa, but they have made it very clear that they do not want to participate in that government and that they will be seeking their own autonomous regime-that is where their efforts will be concentrated. I think that does show not only a consistency of purpose but also a recognition that it is going to be a very fragile dismantling, a very difficult process which should not be rushed into. That is why the fact that the independence process is likely to take a period of months before there is any finality achieved even in Addis Ababa, I think, underlines the importance of mature political approaches.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think all of the parties in Ethiopia broadly described started off as avowed Marxists and, indeed, in many ways I think Mengistu has been largely responsible for discrediting those sorts of notions and aspirations. His was probably the last country in the world to declare itself a people's republic. It was certainly the last country to set up a Marxist-Leninist party in 1984. When one recognises the enormity of the offences and the brutality perpetrated by his regime harking back to the red terror in the late 1970s-I was certainly in Addis Ababa and witnessed the results of that, and I well remember stories about heads being hung on lampposts to warn people against confronting the regime, most of whose cabinet members were personally executed by Mengistu-one can see that a regime that called itself Marxist-Leninist was really doing its best to totally discredit that sort of a label. Given the passage of events in eastern Europe and elsewhere in the last couple of years, I think all of the parties to the conflict realise that that sort of slogan and that sort of recipe can offer them no hope at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The support of the United States will be very important in ensuring that we have mature progress. I was particularly heartened to read comments by Mr Issias Afwerki, who represented the Eritrean People's Liberation Front in talks in London earlier this month. A newspaper article quoting his remarks stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Eritrean guerillas might have been influenced by Marxist ideas-``if you were not a leftist at university in the 1960s, you were ostracised''-but peasants and farmers had had enough of such ideas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, he has travelled very extensively in recent years promoting the Eritrean cause. On the subject of the role of the United States, which is normally the paramount villain in the demonology of most emerging nations, the article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The US could still play a key role in bringing democracy to Ethiopia, he believed. Its leverage was moral rather than political. But the US influence-the target of angry demonstrations in Addis Ababa-``would definitely have a constructive effect''.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was also sympathetic to the efforts by the former colonial masters, the Italians, British and French to broker peace in the Horn of Africa.
       </para>
       <para>
        He had little time for more ``revolutionary'' regimes that professed support for Eritreans, especially radical Arab States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The interference of the Libyans, Syrians and Iraqis had been motivated mainly by a wish to destabilise the Addis Ababa government-a recipient of Israeli aid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those comments show a maturity of political purpose that will serve Eritrea well in the years ahead. I take this opportunity tonight to acknowledge that it has been a war without parallel. I do not think there has been another civil war in the twentieth century that has gone on for as long as this war has. It has, I think, reached its culmination in a way that the Eritreans always believed it would. However, those who have followed its progress had come to think it would never reach a conclusion.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are seeing some very historic events, and some very constructive moves are taking place which will, I think, result in a negotiated settlement that will not simply blow the borders apart but allow for genuine acts of self-determination to result in the Eritreans in particular being able to conduct their own affairs. After all these years of struggle, they have certainly managed to achieve miracles on the way through, not just with hospitals and almost complete cities underground but also with very extensive education systems, all of which have had to withstand the barrage of constant bombing overhead. Having come through that sort of 30-year baptism, they are going to be well placed to undertake the just as difficult transition to peace and to economic progress.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pay particular tribute to the efforts of Fessahaie Abraham, as the representative of the Eritrean Relief Association in Australia. I speak in my capacity as a parliamentary patron of that Association, together with Senator Schacht from the Australian Labor Party. We are both very pleased indeed with the passage of events to date. We hope that the Australian Government will do all it can to ensure that whatever role it can play will be played, and that whatever assistance we can sensibly offer will be offered. I have in mind particularly technical assistance, not just the transfer of funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are all aware of the endemic droughts and famines that beset the Horn of Africa. This year is no exception. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations in Rome is still saying that the level of Western assistance is by no means enough, and that we still face the prospect of drought and famine for some seven to eight million people in the region. An enormous amount can be done on the emergency relief front and on the political and diplomatic fronts.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope, and I am sure that it will be the case, that Australia will continue to take a keen interest. A number of refugees have come to this country from that region. They have been model citizens. They have made the Government aware of the need to assist not just the Eritreans but all those others who have been victims of strife in the region and, in the years to come, for Australia to continue to play a constructive role.

Subsidy levels are adjusted annually to take into account cost increases.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) It is more meaningful to refer to the increase in expenditure on an annual, rather than on a fortnightly, basis. This is because the impact will change from fortnight to fortnight, as additional numbers of pensioners (eg new grants and reviews) become affected by deeming.
      </para>
      <para>
       In annual terms, the Budget estimate of savings from deeming on cash and accounts was $51.9 million in 1991-92. The revised estimate of the decrease in expenditure on Department of Social Security pensions on the basis of a 10% deeming rate was $95 million in the first full year. This was based on the annualized effect of the impact of the implementation of deeming in March 1991 and projections of additional pensioners affected over the period to the end of 1991-92. The reduction in the deeming rate to 8% is estimated approximately to halve the decrease in expenditure on pensions. Thus the savings are likely to be about $47.5 million in 1991-92 compared with the Budget estimate of $51.9 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Pensioners whose pensions have been reduced by the deeming provisions because they have deemed income included in their pension assessment had their pension entitlements automatically adjusted for the reduction in the deeming rate, with effect from the 6 June pension payday.
      </para>
      <para>
       For pensioners with money in pensioner accounts which were paying the previous deeming rate of 10%, if banks and other financial institutions decide to reduce interest rates on these accounts in response to the reduced deeming rate, it is in the interest of pensioners to advise the Department. This ensures that they are paid any increase in pension which is due to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       To make it easy for pensioners to advise the Department of special pensioner accounts which may have a reduction in interest rates because of the lower deeming rate, a special deeming data collection centre has been established. The centre will enable quick reassessment of pensions resulting from falls in interest rates. Pensioners with these accounts will not need to contact their bank to check whether the interest rate has fallen, as the Department will do this for them.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is not possible to identify separately all costs associated with the reduction in the deeming rate. Most of the tasks associated with the change (such as providing information, computer processing and pension reassessments) are part of ongoing, normal staff duties and processes and cannot be separated out. Information about the change and action required by pensioners was included in the May edition of Age Pension News.
      </para>
      <para>
       Separate processes for which costs can be identified are as follows:

       * Departmental letters to non-age pensioners informing them of deeming rate change: $22,000
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) is an estimate only, as final costs will depend on the volume of telephone calls to the centre.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, all costs associated with the change are being met from within existing Departmental staffing and administrative allocations, with no supplementation.

      <para>
       (4) It is estimated that around 54,000 pensioners aged 80 years or more (including partners) are currently being paid a higher rate of pension because the deeming rules are not being applied to them until the Department contacts them to explain the deeming rules.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The special contact arrangements for pensioners aged 80 or more are being undertaken by Departmental staff, including FISP officers, as part of their duties. In some States, special units have been set up and in others the procedures are being undertaken by Area Office staff of the Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not possible to identify separately the cost of these measures. However, the measures are being undertaken within existing staff and administrative allocations for the Department, without supplementation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) It is more meaningful to refer to the decrease in expenditure on an annual, rather than a fortnightly, basis. This is because the impact will change from fortnight to fortnight.
      </para>
      <para>
       In annual terms, the decrease in expenditure on Social Security pensions as a result of applying the deeming provisions to the pensioners referred to at (4) above is estimated to be $5.6 million in a full year. This is included in the overall decrease in expenditure of $95 million as a result of the deeming provisions at (1) above.
