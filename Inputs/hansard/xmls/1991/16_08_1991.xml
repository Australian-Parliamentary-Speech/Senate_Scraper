       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:
      </para>
      <para>
       The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       * That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the right to life to all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.

      <para>
       That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio.

       Report on Higher Education: Australian Capital Territory
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely affect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.

In fact, it is perhaps the most important Bill for the future of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australian relations. It is important at the outset to congratulate certainly the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner, and indeed the Opposition spokesperson, Dr Michael Wooldridge, on achieving bipartisan support. As honourable senators will know, it is unusual to get bipartisan support about many issues in either chamber of the Australian Parliament.

         â€”I beg Senator Kernot's pardon, but we take for granted on the question of Aboriginal rights the Democrats' support of a Bill such as this. It is significant that bipartisanship has been received, particularly when one considers some of the extremely negative debate that occurred when Minister Hand was putting forward the ATSIC legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Minister Tickner has worked strenuously to avoid the bitter and divisive debates of the past which have highlighted a polarisation of the major parties on how best to achieve social justice for the original Australians. This Bill, which will allow a 10-year process of conciliation and education, will, I believe, test Australia's reputation as an egalitarian society, because for all the rhetoric, for all the best efforts of government-certainly, both State and Federal governments have taken tremendous initiatives in the past and I commend them for their efforts-Australian Aborigines do not have equality in our society. This is being watched around the world. I do not think any member of this chamber has ever travelled overseas without being asked, `What about your Aborigines? What are you doing about the Aboriginal problem, as it is called?'.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not an Aboriginal problem; it is a white Australian problem. Certainly, the conditions that many Aboriginal Australians live in are a tremendous problem for them in that they cannot have the same standards of living as non-Aboriginal Australians. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that the problem rests with white Australians, and this reconciliation process is our last chance before the year 2001 to make a difference and to start to attain this vital goal. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody clearly identified the vital need for this reconciliation process. In its final report, chapter 38, recommendation 339, it stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        That all political leaders and their parties recognize that reconciliation between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in Australia must be achieved if community division, discord and injustice to Aboriginal people are to be avoided. To this end the Commission recommends that political leaders use their best endeavours to ensure bi-partisan public support for the process of reconciliation and that the urgency and necessity of the process be acknowledged.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we have that bipartisanship in this place and the House of Representatives, but I am concerned that it does not necessarily extend to all State parliaments. I urge all State governments to move in the same direction as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Robert Tickner, Dr Michael Wooldridge and the Australian Democrats have moved to get that bipartisanship in the Australian Parliament to ensure that it extends to other areas of government. It has not been achieved to date. Some of the statements that come out of the Queensland Parliament on behalf of the Liberal and National parties and a number of other State parliaments indicate that we still have a long way to go to get bipartisanship across all areas of government. Indeed, that could apply just as equally to local government, which has a special relationship with and a very important role to play in the Aboriginal reconciliation process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me now turn my attention to one of the greatest tragedies affecting Aboriginal people; that is, Aboriginal deaths in custody and the very high rate of imprisonment of Aboriginal Australians. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody showed us that the statistics were extremely alarming and that the circumstances of the deaths in custody were deeply disturbing. Had the same rate of death in custody occurred among non-Aboriginal prisoners in Australia, it is estimated by the Australian Institute of Criminology that 7,592 deaths would have occurred in the eight-year period preceding the royal commission inquiry. I think that figure bears repeating: had the ratio of Aboriginal deaths been the same as for the rest of the population, 7,592 non-Aboriginal Australians would have died. This comparison highlights the scope of the tragedy of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It is inconceivable that 7,500 non-Aboriginal Australians could die in custody in unusual circumstances or that the situation could ever reach that level, and yet a comparable level, given the population basis of Aboriginal Australians, was accepted before the royal commission was held.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, it is a strong reminder to us to tackle the crucial issue of Aboriginal criminal justice because, although we have the royal commission and it has brought down excellent reports with outstanding recommendations that must be adopted by governments, still the percentage of Aboriginal people in gaol rises. This is illustrated by a news report from yesterday that says that Australia's gaol population increased by 10 per cent in 1990, according to census figures released in Canberra yesterday. The Australian Institute of Criminology figures show that there were 14,304 prisoners in 1990 compared with 12,964 in 1989. However, a 40 per cent increase in Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders imprisoned was recorded in 1990, bringing the total to 2,041. Despite those appalling figures, the Royal Commission and the recommendations in the report brought down recently, still the imprisonment rate of Aboriginal people continues to escalate and to be totally distorted from the percentage increase of non-Aboriginal Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, it is a responsibility for all governments to seriously tackle this problem. I will concede that State governments, particularly in my home State of Queensland, are starting to respond and some new initiatives have been taken. A unique Aboriginal and Islander prisoner committee has been set up in Townsville to liaise with prisoners and staff. However, while this committee is operating-and that is to be commended-management and staff continue to frustrate the efforts of that committee with petty detail that is totally inappropriate, given the scope of the problem that we have in relation to the rate of imprisonment and the rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody. For example, as recently as 12 April this year Aboriginal prisoners involved in an incident at the Townsville correctional centre were told by a correctional centre officer:
       </para>
       <para>
        We don't have to hang you blacks. You black--
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not going to say the word--
       </para>
       <para>
        hang yourself.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a statement made in 1991. After all the talk, the Royal Commission and the efforts of Government, still, in a prison in this country, we have an officer who will make a statement like that. No wonder the Aboriginal and Islander prisoner liaison committee in Townsville is frustrated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday, when I was preparing this speech, I got a note from one of the members of that liaison committee. He went out to the prison and was told by a senior member of management-after a meeting at the gate to the maximum security area-that he was not appropriately dressed to visit the centre. Since when were visits to prisoners a matter of high fashion? It is absolutely ludicrous that such a standard should be raised about the way in which a person was dressed. As the individual says:
       </para>
       <para>
        I was better dressed than what I was when I addressed the UN in Geneva and also when I socialised with members of Royalty in Europe.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the words of the Aboriginal member of the Aboriginal and Islander prisoners liaison committee, he was dressed in a similar fashion-in fact, he said that he was better dressed-to when he spoke at the United Nations. Yet that dress is not accepted when he is going in to work with prison staff to try to get better relations in the Townsville correctional centre. Clearly, the question of how we deal with this issue must be first on the agenda for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are those who are not as effusive in their congratulations and their commitment to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. I want to speak for the remainder of my time about the concerns, the reservations and the outright objections that Aboriginal people have to the reconciliation process. I do not agree with them because I believe that this is such a unique opportunity for us to bring Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians together. If I were an Aboriginal person who had suffered the kinds of discrimination and frustration that they have for so many years, I would be cynical too. There have been so many words, so many promises and so much debate in the past that some Aboriginal people say, `Another talkfest-another opportunity for sitting around the table-but when will we get the fundamentals?'.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the fundamentals? A group of Aboriginal women from Queensland came to Canberra by bus yesterday to see me. I know that they spoke to Senator Kernot and the Minister. They are concerned because, firstly, they did not know about the reconciliation process until they arrived in Canberra yesterday. They had not heard about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        That shows that, through ATSIC, we still have a long way to go to get that vital communication process in operation. We have ATSIC now, but ATSIC members have a vital responsibility to ensure that women like the women who visited me yesterday know what is going on, know about the programs and the commitments of government and know how the community has to be involved, because we will never get adequate reconciliation without the support of local communities, be they Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. So communication and consultation are a priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        These women were community leaders from Rockhampton and Brisbane. They are the people who have dealt with the alcoholism and the violence. They have inherited the memories of the rape by white settlers. They know that their sisters in Aurukun are trying to address the very serious disturbances in that community, and they say, `What will this reconciliation do for the health of our people? What will reconciliation do in terms of the education of our people? How will it stop the alcoholism?'. Above all, they say, `What about land rights? Until we have land rights and until we have economic independence to manage our own affairs, what will this reconciliation Bill do? We want basic justice. We don't want reconciliation'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think I managed to get the point through to the Government-this is the view that I believe in-that reconciliation is essential. With the exception of land rights, the Government is working on the issues of health, housing, education, employment and basic justice through legal aid for Aboriginal people. The question of land rights, however, is fundamental. I suppose that it is there where I draw a distinction between government policy and views that I hold about how important land rights is to this reconciliation process.
       </para>
       <para>
        The long running academic debate about terra nullius has so far determined that Australian Aborigines have limited legality to land claims. However, the Mabo case, currently awaiting judgment in the High Court, could well challenge our traditional interpretation of Aboriginal settlement and subsequent policies for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a recent article in the Age, Aboriginal lawyer Sandra Bailey remarked that Aborigines were still haunted by what she called the `empty land lie'. She explained that, as the head of the Aboriginal Issues Unit of the Victorian arm of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, she had held discussions with communities all over the State. In doing so, she had discovered that there was a broad consensus that the fundamental issue was that of dispossession. All other issues stem from it in some way. Seeking solutions to current Aboriginal problems, she had come to believe that an appropriate start would be the recognition of the sovereignty of Aboriginal people. It would remove the oppressive lie of terra nullius and take us out of dependency, which is perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, opponents of the Aboriginal cause would reject this prescription, while at the same time attaching great importance to the doctrine of terra nullius. Indeed, they would argue that it was adopted by the British Government when Australia was first settled, that it is now impossible to reverse such a decision and that any attempt to do so should be resisted because it could undermine the legal foundations of Australian society.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this way, a rather obscure latin legal term, unknown to all but a few legal specialists until about 10 years ago, has become the focal point for the discussion of Aboriginal rights in contemporary Australia. The doctrine is still underpinned by traditional interpretation of both law and history. Each draws strength from the other.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his 1971 judgment, Mr Justice Blackburn threw his full weight behind the doctrine. A major reason for this was his assessment of the reasons for the Imperial Government's rejection of the treaty negotiated between Victorian Aborigines and the entrepreneurial Port Phillip Association in 1835. The treaty, he argued, was never officially considered to be in the nature of the purchases from Indians which were customary in America. He said, `It was simply a trespass on Crown Land'. What is more, the action of the British authorities was `a cogent demonstration of the total absence from official policy of any idea that the Aboriginals had any proprietary interest in the land'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a legal view but similarly, taking an historical view, in his An Australian Legal History, the legal historian, A.C. Castles, supported Blackburn's interpretation, arguing that the decision in the Batman affair `seems to have ended, once and for all, the possibility that Aboriginal rights should be recognised administratively, except when they were accorded by statute'. This interpretation has been reaffirmed recently by a number of academic historians. When the colonial government rejected Batman's treaty, Attwood explained, it reiterated the principles of terra nullius. Shaw concurred, arguing that by its action the British Government reiterated the orthodox view that Australia was uninhabited in 1778, that it was terra nullius.
       </para>
       <para>
        The contentious doctrine still has powerful underpinning in history, but challenges have been mounted on both the legal and historical fronts. For example, recent research shows that the original intention of the British Government was far from clear and may in fact have been premised on the mistaken assumption that much of the continent was uninhabited and, therefore, literally terra nullius. Despite that, many early colonists-free settlers, missionaries, officials-recognised that Aborigines were in possession of land, of distinct and recognisable tracks of territory, which was defended against trespassers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Imperial Government made two distinct commitments to land rights between 1836 and 1848 in the letters patent granted to the South Australian Colonizing Commission and in the provisions for further rights on all land leased under the provisions of the Australian Waste Land Act 1848. Clearly, it remains open for debate in legal and historical circles. Of course, all these issues will come to a head in the Mabo case in which we expect a judgment to be brought down later this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Historic land rights legislation will be a crucial stepping stone in the reconciliation process in Queensland. We have to be fair and acknowledge that the legislation, while very strongly criticised by a number of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people for failing to include a land acquisition fund-I cannot understand why Queensland could not adopt a similar practice to that adopted just across the border in New South Wales by a Liberal government-is an important start in acknowledging the legitimacy of the relationship of Aborigines with the land in Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I emphasise that in Queensland this legislation must only be regarded as a start and if there is not to be a land acquisition fund through the land tax procedure, which is a very simple, ongoing process, a land acquisition fund must be set up and funded generously through the Budgets of both the Queensland and Federal governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Queenslanders, like other Australians, will need to adopt a strong commitment to the reconciliation process. Queensland's history of race relations is not a proud one. The recent conflicts over land rights legislation indicate the sensitivity of the debate and the need for ongoing communication and understanding. Only through patient dialogue can we achieve genuine equity.

         â€”One of the reasons why the Senate is able to debate the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill fairly thoroughly and with a deep understanding is that most honourable senators have the privilege of representing the whole of their State and, therefore, travel to many outback and remote areas. It is clear from the contribution from Senator Reynolds that she has spent a lot of time in the Queensland outback and has had that exposure. During my brief time in this place, I have had the privilege of going to places like Wyndham, Roebourne, Kalgoorlie, Norseman and Carnarvon where there are significant Aboriginal populations and significant problems within the Aboriginal communities.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In trying to solve the problems of the Aboriginal community and reconcile the non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal communities, there has been a preoccupation with structures, bureaucracy and government imposed solutions. The latter part of Senator Reynolds's contribution on the land rights debate highlighted that preoccupation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The land rights debate in my home State of Western Australia took place in the early 1980s. Brian Burke became Premier, having solemnly promised the people of Western Australia land rights in the lead-up to the election. That promise led to an unnecessarily divisive debate which did more to hurt the chances of any reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people than anything else that has happened in Western Australia for a long, long time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, one could argue that the infamous Noonkanbah dispute was less harmful to the reconciliation process than the land rights debate which was sparked by the then Premier, Brian Burke. The former Premier built up to an unsustainable level people's hopes in both communities. Of course, when he backed off his land rights promise, he upset the Aboriginal community and those people in the non-Aboriginal community who supported those land rights claims. As a result, he hurt relations between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we must be careful-and all people contributing to this debate have recognised this fact-not to raise people's hopes too much through the creation of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. All honourable senators contributing to the debate have been careful to point that out. I do not think any of us are creating expectations that are too high.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Reynolds pointed out that the delegation that saw her and other honourable senators yesterday did not know about the reconciliation process. This reinforces the need for all of us to work to ensure that the Council is not just another bureaucracy, council, committee, summit or talk-feast. It has to get back to the local community. There has to be activity at the community level and political will behind the process to ensure that this reconciliation is implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been communication and negotiations between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the shadow Minister, Dr Wooldridge, to ensure that the structure being set up is accountable. There need to be targets and mission statements. It is important that performance be judged on a regular basis by this Parliament and the community. This should help to solve problems in a way that previous councils have been unable to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the disputes that have occurred around Australia in the past few months include: Coronation Hill; the ongoing disputes in Western Australia over the Wagyl; the Swan Brewery site; the preoccupation with sacred sites; and now the Yakabindie dispute where the Premier, Carmen Lawrence, wants to proceed with the development of that nickel deposit by Dominion Mining. Her Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is now calling for a fourth ethnographic survey of the area after three have been completed and after the local Aboriginal communities have clearly said that they want to proceed with the development. Of course, other Aboriginal groups thousands of miles away from the Yakabindie area are trying to stop the development. They are now calling for the Federal Minister, Robert Tickner, to intervene and stop the development of this nickel deposit.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is simply a good example-or a bad example, one might say-of the sort of division that is caused between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. It is not the fault of the local Aboriginals around the Yakabindie area. It is the fault of the political activists who would seek to use the Aboriginal cause, the heritage values associated with sacred sites, and the religious beliefs, for their own political ends. If the reconciliation process can focus upon this harmful aspect and the way that the Aboriginal cause is used as a pawn in a political game, perhaps we can achieve something.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a multi-partisan commitment, a humanitarian commitment, by politicians of all parties over the past few decades to solving the problems with which the Aboriginal race are afflicted. On any reflection it is fair to say that the humanitarian commitment, the concern which has been reflected in the millions and probably billions of dollars which have gone towards the solution of those Aboriginal problems, has done little to help the cause of the Aboriginal people over the last two or three decades.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one goes to places such as Wyndham, Roebourne, Kalgoorlie, Norseman or Carnarvon, one sees that the plight of the Aboriginal people in many of those areas-in the towns, on the fringes of the towns and out on some of the stations and missions-is a very sad and sorry sight. It has not improved with the expenditure of all those millions and indeed billions of dollars over the past three decades. Let us all hope that this reconciliation process means there is at least some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. It will create a little more hope and may help to solve some of the problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's support for this legislation is based on the fact that reconciliation needs to be achieved at the community level. It is no use setting up another bureaucracy in Canberra to solve these problems; we have proved in the past that that does not work. We must concentrate on Aboriginal criminal justice, the crime rate among the Aboriginal community, the mortality rate, health problems, and the destruction of much of the heritage and rich culture of the Aboriginal people. We must create a process that ensures that non-Aboriginal Australians have a deeper understanding of the Aboriginal race, their opportunities and their problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        The `us and them' mentality which has grown up in many of the towns in Western Australia is something that needs to be solved. I have somewhat cynical reservations about what this process can achieve, but the `us and them' mentality, which is clearly evident in some of the towns I have mentioned, is one of the problems that needs to be solved. When one walks down the main street of a town such as Roebourne and sees Aborigines lying down along the median strips with bottles of wine and beer lying around them, one wonders at the depth of the problem and what this reconciliation process can do to alleviate that.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the concerns that I have with this legislation is that coming up with a treaty or some instrument of reconciliation could be seen in the long run as the only practical or solid evidence of any achievement, and that could become the sole focus of this Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. In Dr Hewson's letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on this subject earlier this year, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We fully support the statement of Commissioner Johnston, contained in his final report into the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody where he said: ``The approach should concentrate on the process of reconciliation and not on an instrument . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I support that process. It is quite clear from the clauses of the Bill creating this Council that there is a concentration on producing a formal document or documents. Indeed, in subclause 6(1) under the functions of the Council there is quite a preoccupation with the outcome of a document. Paragraphs (g) and (h) read:
       </para>
       <para>
        (g) to consult Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community on whether reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or formal documents of reconciliation; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (h) after that consultation, to report to the Minister on the views of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community as to whether such a document or documents would benefit the Australian community as a whole and if the Council considers there would be such a benefit, to make recommendations to the Minister on the nature and content of, and manner giving effect to, such a document or documents . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Out of all the functions of the Council, that is probably the most specific reference to any action which will actually take place under this reconciliation process.
       </para>
       <para>
        I restate my concern that treaties, structures and bureaucracies will not solve these problems. If, in the end, this Council for Reconciliation focuses on the creation of a treaty or even on building up a political ground swell for a treaty then, in my eyes, it will have failed because that is not going to solve the problems this nation is faced with. Until we solve those problems that in the last decade we have not been able to solve, we cannot ever call ourselves a mature nation because in the eyes of the world and in our own eyes the plight of the Aboriginal people is a plight of all Australian people. It is a problem for all of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by referring to comments made by Senator Reynolds and other honourable senators in this debate. It is important to have a genuine, multipartisan approach to this issue. Nothing can be achieved in this important area of activity without a genuine commitment by all parties. That commitment needs to be across all of the State parliaments, at the local government level, at the local community level and, most importantly, here in Federal Parliament. We have achieved that more and more over previous years, particularly in the last 12 or 15 months with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the shadow Minister, Dr Wooldridge.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we go down the track of trying to create a treaty, of building up a political ground swell for a treaty or using the reconciliation process to put national land rights back onto the political agenda, then that non-partisanship will disappear very quickly. I caution honourable senators to ensure that this reconciliation process does focus on activity and reconciliation at the community level and that it does not, as a consequence, seek to place a treaty and land rights back on the national political agenda. That would destroy that bipartisanship and any hope that this Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will create in the minds of all Australians.

         â€”in reply-I will not detain the Senate long in responding to the contributions that have been made during this debate. In the main, they have been thoughtful and positive. Most speakers have stressed at least conditional support for the beginning of this process. I would like to comment on the reference made by Senator Campbell to the Opposition amendments that are going to be moved at the conclusion of this debate in respect of setting up benchmarks and targets to be met by this Council.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I simply indicate at this stage that the Government will be opposing these amendments. My own personal view is that they are not amendments that anyone would want to die in a ditch over on either side of the Parliament. They are largely peripheral issues but, in my view, they do relate to a very important point.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Campbell did place great emphasis on the need for this Council to achieve benchmarks and targets. In the contribution to this debate made by my colleague from the Northern Territory, Senator Tambling, he referred to something in similar vein in respect of accountability and responsibility in the allocation of funding. It is reasonable to say that honourable senators should take note of contributions which are made to debates such as this by people like Senator Tambling, who represents such a very high proportion of Aboriginal people in the electorate he serves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say, with respect, that this relates to something which irritates me greatly. In past debates in this chamber I have said that Aboriginal people in Australia, with regard to achieving the targets that we set for them, are in the same position as women in the community in that it is never good enough for them to do as well as everyone else for them to be seen equally with everyone else; they always have to do better than everyone else. In his contribution Senator Tambling said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past four years I have asked thousands of questions in the Federal Parliament and in Senate Estimates committees relating to the waste and inefficiency in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. I make no apologies; my motives in concentrating on this portfolio were and are to improve the efficiency of service delivery, to demand accountability for taxpayers' funds . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        They are goals which I support and with which I agree. Accountability does need to be brought in but it also needs to be put into perspective in terms of the constant emphasis which is placed on the failure of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities to meet these targets and benchmarks that we set.
       </para>
       <para>
        By comparison, who are some of the premier people in our community-in our society-at the upper end of the social scale? I would suggest that they are people in the corporate sector and in the banking industry. These are people who are held in high regard and are considered to be some of the more responsible, and they are certainly well-off citizens in this country. I want to put this in context. I am not saying I am decrying the need for this accountability; it is essential for every single dollar of taxpayers' money that is spent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fair to note that in terms of this upper echelon of our own society which we hold in such high regard, the corporate sector and the banking sector in the Australian community in the last four to five years have flushed down the toilet, not money that has been wasted on Aboriginal Affairs, but more money-if we added up every single dollar since Federation-than has ever been spent on the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio in total by every conceivable government.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not a partisan view-I think many people in the Opposition would share it. There does seem to be a different standard that we as a community apply to the multi billions of dollars thrown away by the outrageous behaviour of the corporate sector-linked to some fairly irresponsible behaviour, in my view, by the banking sector in supporting it-in the last four to five years, when compared with the money spent on citizens who, beyond argument, are still the most deprived people in this country.

        To be fair to Senator Tambling-and I want to be fair to Senator Tambling-I did try to follow this debate and I read the speeches of those speakers I could not follow. Unfortunately, I was tied up when Senator Tambling spoke, but I read his speech this morning and, to be fair, he did start off on this negative note for the first eight or nine pages. It is worthy of note that he did then say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The opposite side of the coin is to look at the positive areas where results are evident. I put on the record a couple of points that need to be recognised. One is public education and the other is public health.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tambling made two positive suggestions in the areas of public education and public health, as anyone who reads his speech will note. Frankly, these suggestions intrigued me. I look forward with anticipation to the contributions that will be made in the deliberations of this Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill as to the suggestions of people who are familiar with the Aboriginal community and how Aboriginal people can improve their lot.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of Senator Tambling's positive suggestions was that Aboriginal people should spend far more time watching the Bill Cosby program on television. I am not misquoting him. This is what he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I recount a recent visit that I made to Ngukurr, a community in my electorate, where I sat down with elders of the council . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tambling said that one of the elders said that he liked watching the Bill Cosby program. When Senator Tambling asked him why, he said `that for the first time he had seen what it was like inside my lounge room'-that is, Senator Tambling's lounge room-`my bedroom, my kitchen, and how I managed my relationships with my teenage kids'. I have great difficulty in accepting that this is what did happen, but Senator Tambling said it did, so I assume it did. Senator Tambling went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that appreciation comes from the fact that usually an Aboriginal person would not get into my house in a normal operational way-
       </para>
       <para>
        I assume that means through the front door. I cannot understand what other meaning could be put on it. `An Aboriginal person would not get into my house in a normal operational way'-I think that is extraordinary language. He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . I would rather see a television set put into every Aboriginal humpy before a water tap . . . A number of people felt that I was being heartless and cruel in not putting in the essential water tap first.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was referring to the statement he made in the Northern Territory. I would like to dissociate myself from those people who thought that Senator Tambling was being heartless and cruel by suggesting that Aboriginal people needed a colour television before they needed fresh water. I did not think that at all. I just thought Senator Tambling was being ignorant.

        But I was really saying that if we would put in a means of communication, the water tap would soon follow and it would be used properly in the administration of health.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tambling was saying that if we put a colour television set in every Aboriginal `humpy' in the Northern Territory-and I recall the statement when he made it; I thought it was absurd then, I think it is absurd now, and I am astonished that he would give it breath in the Federal Parliament-the Aboriginal people would have the opportunity to watch the Bill Cosby program on television and would learn how to responsibly use the water taps which we would then benevolently give them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of allocating public funds, I personally would prefer to see them spent initially on water and sewerage facilities rather than on putting television sets in every Aboriginal humpy so that Aboriginal people could learn the benefits of our good life by watching Bill Cosby on television. But, to be fair to Senator Tambling, he went on to make another positive contribution. He said that there should be a mattress replacement program in Aboriginal communities. So it will be an interesting debate. As soon as we fix Aboriginal people, as soon as those Aboriginal people are in the happy position of being able to sit in their humpy on their new mattress, watching Bill Cosby on their 25-inch colour television, everything else will follow.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tambling is entitled to his views. I do not think there is any debate in this Parliament that will canvass a more broad-ranging and divergent set of views than Aboriginal affairs. It has in all the debates that I have read-in the Hansards of not only the Federal Parliament but also the State parliaments. I have a particular view on how government should approach Aboriginal people which I know is not universally popular with some Aboriginal people. Senator Tambling probably would not disagree with it too much.
       </para>
       <para>
        I guess we are all entitled to see people as we like to. Some people look at people and see them as black, yellow or brown; Moslem, Catholic or Protestant. I suppose that after a long time in public administration, in trying to do my poor best to help people who walk into my office, as Senator Tambling does, I see people in two groups-those who need help and those who do not.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make that point because Senator Crowley, in her contribution to this debate, said that she felt it was wrong for people to reiterate constantly the sins of the past and concentrate on the injustices of the past in the attitudes we take towards improving the lot of Aboriginal people. I agree with her. The simple point I make is that when addressing the injustices done to Aboriginal people there is absolutely no need to live in the past. I think we need to be conscious of the past; I think we need to be aware of the truth of what happened and why it happened and we need to be aware of to what very great degree government policies were directly instrumental in bringing about some of those injustices. But in terms of trying to redress the injustice done to Aboriginal people, there is simply no need to live in the past. All we have to do is live in the present.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know what the present realities are for Aboriginal people in terms of my own life. I know that because my wife spends most of her free time doing three things: visiting relatives or friends in gaol-that is hardly surprising considering that in excess of 80 per cent of the prison population in the Northern Territory is black-visiting friends and relatives in hospital; and going to funerals. That is what she does most and I do a fair bit of it myself. That is the reality of life for most Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory today.
       </para>
       <para>
        I recently visited Batchelor College and talked to a friend of mine, David McLeay, who is the Assistant Principal at the College-whom I am sure Senator Tambling knows-about our dreadful personal agony at watching the destruction of Aboriginal communities by substance abuse. I say `substance abuse' not alcohol abuse, because these days kava is wreaking as much havoc among my friends as alcohol is-worse in some cases. David spent many years at Millingimbi and I had just come back from there. I told him about some of the things I had seen and the real shock and distress I had felt at seeing my friends. A particular friend-a teacher at the school who had taught under David-whom I had not seen for some five years is in his early forties and looks like a man of 95, courtesy of kava.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask the Senate to forgive me for telling these anecdotal stories, but they are simply an indication of real life today in an Aboriginal community. I recounted this story to David and he told me of a mutual friend of ours-I do not want to name him as I have not spoken to him about this-who works as an Aboriginal lecturer at the college. David said that a young Aboriginal man from Batchelor died last week from an alcohol-related accident. He said that he had gone to this person at the college and said, `Look, we've got to do something about arranging the funeral for so and so'. He said what followed was quite extraordinary. This person whom he named, off the top of his head, gave him the telephone number of the undertaker in Darwin and the name of the person whom David had to contact at the funeral director's office. In five minutes he reeled off precisely the arrangements that David had to make, including which person he needed to talk to from the air charter company and that person's telephone number. The point is that this particular individual had had to organise so many funerals that this was normal daily business for him. These are tragic human problems that have to be addressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        My view is that, despite all the agonising that has been done by blacks and whites over the terrible injustices that are inflicted, particularly on the real victims of much of this debate-that is the Aboriginal women and children from these communities-one does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to work out fundamentally why it happens. It happens because people are profoundly unhappy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I recall from my youth-and these things stick in one's head-something that my old grandmother used to say to me. My old grandmother was probably like the old grandmothers of many people in here-the backbone of the nation types, wonderful ladies, the sustainers of their families for many years and so on. There used to be many of those people about the place, and they were mostly women. My grandmother used to tell me as a kid that people need three things in this world to be happy: something to do, something to hope for and someone to love. There is still an enormous amount of truth in that view.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that happiness for me, being a total depressive, is when I am not actively suicidal. So it is all relative. When I apply those three fundamental requirements for happiness to Aboriginal friends of mine, it is not hard to see why they turn to booze, kava and everything else. One does not have to tell Aboriginal people what their real place in this society is-they know. In vino veritas, one only has to sit down and have a yarn with them at 3 o'clock in the morning when they are drunk for many of their opinions to come out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Aboriginal people are well aware of the position they really hold in society, and it is a pretty depressing reality if people try to put themselves in their shoes. As I have said on many occasions in the past, it is not hard. If I was a young Aboriginal person with no job, no prospect of having one, with probably a marginal grasp of my language and culture and very little prospect of anything else happening to improve that, I would probably be hard put to stay off the booze myself. So there is a real need-and we all agree on this-to practically attempt to address, within the real limitations that governments of any political persuasion have, the social injustices so that we can help to provide Aboriginal people with something to do and something to hope for.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am encouraged by the contributions made to this debate. I believe that the sentiments expressed by Opposition speakers in this debate are genuine. I believe that we all hope something positive will come out of this process in cooperation with the Aboriginal community. However, having regard to some of the cautions that have quite rightly been expressed by Opposition as well as Government speakers, I want to conclude on this note: at the end of the day we do live in a parliamentary democracy. For many of us, including myself-and pugnacious people like Senator Baume would probably be in the same position-it is often very frustrating to live within the real limitations of a parliamentary democracy. At the end of the day the majority rules. Quite often, people find themselves being passionately committed to causes and issues about which they have deep feelings but are defeated. It happens to us all every time.

In a long period of public life, it is difficult to learn to live with those limitations and still be prepared to say, `Look, even though I got done like a dinner and I hate it, the process itself is worth going on with'.

        I know that what I am about to say will not go down very well with many Aboriginal people whom I know; they will disagree with me. But the difficulty for us all in this process is that we do live in a democracy with all its limitations. A close friend of mine, Father Frank Brennan, who I think is one of the more lucid thinkers in the white community on these issues and whom I have known for many years and have had many hours of discussion with, put in writing his own views-for what they are worth-to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on what he saw as being the reasonable limitations that exist in any process. He did not just talk about treaties or instruments of reconciliation, but everything else.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not have his letter in front of me, but I think that I am doing him reasonable justice when I paraphrase it, and I hope accurately enough-when he laid these points down it struck a chord with me because I agree with him-by saying that what has to be determined in any process is, firstly, what Aboriginal people want. Only one group in the community can legitimately participate in that debate, and that is the Aboriginal people. As Senator Tambling knows full well, what one Aboriginal community wants is often dramatically and radically different from what another wants. Indeed, what often happens-and the Coronation Hill debate of recent times demonstrated this very effectively-is that there are as many disagreements about issues in an Aboriginal community as there are in the non-Aboriginal community. Nevertheless, only the Aboriginal community can initially determine what Aboriginal people want.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having done that and determined to put it into effect, a judgment then has to be made whether what they want is morally reasonable and justifiable. In my view, as in Frank Brennan's view, it is not just the Aboriginal community that is entitled to participate in that debate. Aboriginal people do not have an absolute ownership of morality. We are all entitled to make our own judgments about what is morally justifiable and reasonable in a democracy, as painful as some of them might be, and to canvass them publicly. Having determined that, what then has to be determined is whether it is politically achievable, because that in reality is what will occur at the end of the process.
       </para>
       <para>
        There may well be many Aboriginal people, if they acknowledge that that is the process we have to adopt-and in my view it is-who might say in respect of things, for example, like sovereignty, over which many Aboriginal people legitimately have strong views, `Look, in our view, if that is the test that has to be applied'-and I think it is-`ceding sovereignty to Aboriginal people not being politically achievable', and in my view it is not, `this is a process in which we will not participate because we will never be satisfied with the end result'.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this is to be an honest debate, I honestly believe that all the participants in it, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, do need to apply those three tests. It may well be that when applying those three tests many non-Aboriginal people will feel that this is a debate that they do not want to participate in, either. That is a judgment they have to make. Hopefully, at the end of the day the result will be as encouraging and as positive as having the first step of this process set up. All of us-that is, the Aboriginal community and, in particular, the people who at the end of the day have to deliver something, the members of this Federal Parliament and our colleagues in the State parliaments-will deliver something that is meaningful so that the exercise is considered worth while. In conclusion, I simply say again that I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. I look forward to support on both sides of the Federal Parliament for the successful conclusion of this enterprise.

        The thrust of these amendments is to seek to amend the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill in two ways. In the first place, the amendments seek to set benchmarks so that we can measure the success or otherwise of this venture. I dealt with this at some length in my speech during the second reading debate. I do not want to canvass the matter again beyond saying that we are strongly of the view that there has not been enough concentration on the issue in the past by previous governments about whether what we have been doing for the Aboriginal people, in conjunction with the Aboriginal people, has at the bottom line been in their best interests, and whether we have had successes or failures. Many people are of the view that the net outcome has been one of failure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Listening to the concerns that Senator Collins has about the problems of alcohol and other forms of abuse, one sees the need not only for this Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation but also for the measurement of our success or otherwise because, clearly, there are indications of a degree of failure in the past. We are not here to apportion blame, nor are we here to criticise each other.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say that I was a little disappointed by Senator Collins's comments which misinterpreted what Senator Tambling said. I was disappointed that Senator Collins had to be pushed to read Senator Tambling's next sentence which demonstrated why Senator Tambling had made the fairly dramatic statement that in some instances improved information to the Aboriginal people could lead to a greater capacity to welcome and use effectively, in a health sense, various facilities. I hope that maybe, on reflection, Senator Collins will recognise that the thrust of this debate has been multipartisan, if I can use that word in order to acknowledge the Australian Democrats' position as well. I certainly want to maintain that atmosphere in the debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that there will be a recognition of the need for some benchmarks, even though this will not be in the legislation. I am certain that the Government will have the same sort of enthusiasm to make certain that this legislation works and is in the best interests of all Aboriginal people. I hope that there will be de facto benchmarks and de facto measures of success even if they are not de jure in the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second amendment that I have moved relates to the question of fees to members of the Council. I was interested to hear Senator Collins say, `Well, really, these amendments are peripheral'. He said that, basically, one would not die in the ditch over them. It is true the Opposition is not going to die in the ditch over them. But we still think they are significant; we still think they are matters of principle. We are not dying in the ditch over them because we do not want any suggestion of division to emerge in this multipartisan approach to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. That is the reason we are not pressing the amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, as a matter of principle, we think it is wrong that payment should be made to members of the Council. Senator Collins knows only too well that the Government's original draft maintained the position that we are now maintaining. I do not want to push the Government or the Minister. My understanding is that perhaps the Minister has had difficulties in maintaining what I understood to be his preferred position-which is a polite way of putting it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply want to stress that our decision not to divide on this amendment-although we have moved it-does not diminish in any way our belief that it is right, that it puts forward a principle and that it would improve the workings of the Council. As I said in the second reading debate, we do not want to see this as simply another `jobs for the boys or girls'. Our concern is that such an atmospheric could tarnish the Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that that risk will not be faced. I trust that the calibre and quality of the people appointed will remove any suggestions that `jobs for the boys or girls' will be an element in the membership of the Council. But it seems to me that this is an unnecessary risk to run on such an important issue; it is an unnecessary risk to let this Council be subject to the prospect of such criticism. It is only because of our deep concern and hopes for the success of this Council that we have moved the amendments. I commend them to the chamber.

        While I understand what the Opposition is saying about the accountability, I would like to hear from Senator Baume some suggestions about how we are going to measure. What are the benchmarks of well-being? It is not a three-bedroom brick home; it is not an absence of tooth decay; and it is not tertiary degrees. Is it poverty line statistics? Is it imprisonment rate? What is it and how do you measure it? I see this as one of the difficulties with the amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, in the preamble of the Bill we have an indication that an essential part of the reconciliation process is the need to address the disadvantage of Aboriginal and Islander people. On behalf of the Democrats, I am happy to accept the explanation in the preamble that this Council is being established as a way of monitoring the implementation of whatever processes we decide upon, in consultation, and measuring the progress being made. I do not think it is a legitimate function of the Council to attempt to monitor in this way the concept of well-being. I await with interest Senator Baume's explanation.

         â€”This is the whole problem. I am interested to hear the comment from the honourable senator. We are not prejudging what the benchmarks should be. We are saying that the Council must establish some. I am afraid that we are not-I will not say sufficiently arrogant, but that is probably what it is-sufficiently prepared to prejudge the matter to say what we believe the Council should set as its benchmarks. We think it is up to the Council to establish some benchmarks against which its performance can be measured. If its performance cannot be measured, if it is incapable of establishing whether at the bottom line the net result is of net benefit to the Aboriginal people, we are all wasting our time again. I say `again' because in a large volume of our legislation and intervention in Aboriginal affairs we have in fact `wasted our time' and destroyed the lives of large numbers of Aboriginal people. The alcohol abuse, for example, did not emerge from on high; it emerged as a result of deliberate policies determined by the white Australian community.

        It seems unreal to me that we will be setting out on a course which seeks to achieve reconciliation, and are setting strategies to do it, but are not requiring the Council to establish whether or not those strategies have worked, what the results of the strategies have been, and whether or not we are achieving what is in the best interests of the Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, I assume that there will be, as I said, de facto benchmarks there. All we were seeking to do was to require them to be there and to avoid a situation in which a council which might be less enthusiastic than I hope it will be might seek to fudge the issue. I do not expect a good council to fudge it. I hope that there will be benchmarks. I hope that the very problems that have been raised will be properly coped with by the Council. All we were seeking to do was to put into the legislation what we think will actually happen anyway.

         â€”I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Baume, which would require the Council to have benchmarks by which it would measure its performance. There is a very simple reason for doing this, Mr Chairman-and you would appreciate this-we cannot have a good government without a good opposition. This Government has a very good Opposition, as Senator Chapman says. Unfortunately, the Opposition sometimes exceeds the Government. The role of an opposition is to keep a government up to its task. The role of an opposition is to ensure that a government performs adequately.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Now, unfortunately, in the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill we have no measure by which the Council, which all of us in this chamber support, can be kept to its task. It is inappropriate, if we are to have a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, to have an opposition to that Council. That would defeat the purpose. I am sure that everybody in this chamber would agree with that but, because we cannot have an opposition to ensure that the Council meets the criteria set out for it, that it actually performs its task, it is necessary to find some other mechanism by which the success of the Council can be measured, by which we can judge whether it is really doing what we are hoping it will do.
       </para>
       <para>
        For that reason, we believe that it is very important that the Bill when it is passed have within it a requirement to set benchmarks. Otherwise we will have a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation that will not be able to be measured, we will not know the success of the efforts of the Council and there will be no method by which the Council can be kept firmly glued to its task. For these reasons, those of us on this side strongly support the amendments moved by Senator Baume. What we must do is not just set up a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation but put in place a framework by which that reconciliation process can be made effective.
       </para>
       <para>
        A comment that is quite frequently made to me by members of the Aboriginal community is simply that they have ATSIC, but that ATSIC again is a structure without an opposition, and a structure without any benchmarks by which performance is indicated. They say that this leads in certain circumstances to some of the ATSIC councils and forums not being properly kept to the task. Aboriginal people say to me that this is a source of some dissatisfaction for them. We are embarking upon a landmark effort to solve or alleviate the Aboriginal problem. It is appropriate, therefore, that we get it right the first time. Therefore, I believe it is critical that we have in place methods to ensure that the Council continues to perform to the high standard which we all hope and expect it will deliver, but we need to be able to measure the performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Kernot would be well aware of the incredibly successful efforts of former Senator Peter Baume in Estimates committees. Senator Peter Baume introduced into the Estimates committee process the idea of performance parameters. Everybody in this chamber knows how he did it. He would turn up at an Estimates committee hearing for a random department and say to the departmental officers, `What are your performance parameters? What are your performance indicators? How do you know you have been successful?'. Without wishing to single out any of Peter Baume's achievements as more significant than others, let me say that I think that was a very significant achievement, because it started to bring accountability and a thorough management process into the way the Senate Estimates committees scrutinise the expenditure and the operations of government departments. But we do not want to have to have another Peter Baume to knock the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for six, 12 or 18 months and say, `What are your performance indicators?'. We all accept in this chamber now that performance indicators are absolutely essential to good management, so let us now embrace the idea of benchmarks-which is another word for performance indicators-in this Bill to ensure that we get it right the first time.
       </para>
       <para>
        This chamber has a great Estimates committee process. It does really great things. We need to take our proven success in that area and apply it to this field so that the process for Aboriginal reconciliation does not go down the wrong road. How are we going to set those benchmarks? That was the other question that Senator Kernot put to Senator Michael Baume. I want to address that matter, too. I am not trying to fudge the issue. In part, the matter has to be determined by the Council, but we have to require the Council to make very clear what those benchmarks are. The actual goal setting, of course, is part of the process of reconciliation, and the benchmarks for the success of the Council will come out of the process of goal setting. The way I would envisage this whole scheme working is that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation would sit down and decide what goals it ultimately wanted to achieve. Some of those goals will perhaps be unattainable, but they will be goals that are worth striving for anyway.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having set those goals, it is then appropriate and possible to set benchmarks along the way by which the Council can determine whether it has been successful and by which it can reassess the process to ensure that it manages to perform to the optimal level. We do not want to have any possibility that, for whatever reason, this process could get sidetracked. That is why we believe that it is important that the Bill contain right at the outset a requirement for benchmarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        This would achieve one other very important objective. One of the great problems with what was formerly the Department of Aboriginal Affairs-now the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-is that people say too frequently that Aboriginal Affairs is not accountable and is not subject to the rules of accountability, whether that be financial accountability or accountability in terms of the performance that the service delivers. This is not a criticism that comes just from the wider white community, but frequently it comes to me from members of the Aboriginal community because they say that too often the structures set up to deal with the Aboriginal problems are not accountable to the people and there is no real way to work out their effectiveness.
       </para>
       <para>
        By supporting this amendment we have an opportunity to do away with that potential objection to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. That is why I believe we have to embrace this amendment, because it would put up front the fact that it is not just a new era of talkfest but a new era of attitude to Aboriginal reconciliation, and that the Council will be started off on the right foot.

Part of it will be opinion polls, but part of it will be other things as well; for example, we can encourage the Aboriginal community to raise its self-esteem within the wider community through its own achievements.

        As I said, the ultimate goal setting is the first task of the Council.

We want this to work; we have one chance; we should not blow it now and that is why we must support the amendment moved by Senator Baume.

        Were Senator Kernot to turn to Part 2, clause 6(1) (j), she would note that:

       <para>
        in accordance with Part 3, to develop strategic plans that include a statement of the Council's goals and objectives in the promotion of the process of reconciliation and of its strategies for achieving them, together with indicators and targets for measuring the Council's performance in relation to those goals and objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Council is to provide indicators and targets for measuring, but the Council itself is not required to measure. That is the issue; I thought that was clear enough. Our amendment would require the Council to monitor and evaluate itself. Surely Senator Kernot realises that that is a significant difference? That is the reason the Opposition is moving this amendment; the Opposition is saying that the Council must monitor and evaluate the implementation of benchmarks in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander well-being and, of course, then-not simply, as indicated, by one group, but by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments-progress towards achieving those benchmarks. That goes much further than clause 6(1) (i) of Part 2, which says:
       </para>

        Through that clause the Council does not have to establish what the benchmarks of progress are and it does not have to monitor or evaluate them itself. We are calling on the Council to do that; we think this is a gap in the legislation and, as I said earlier, I am convinced the Council will do it anyway, so why not put it in the legislation?

         â€”I trust that when I rose to my feet-rather ponderously, I thought-after Senator Campbell's address to close the debate I was not responsible for preventing Senator O'Chee from contributing anything to the second reading debate of this Bill, which of course he did not, but I do welcome his late contribution to the committee stage of the legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        With respect to Senator O'Chee, I think he set, in his contribution, an impossible benchmark for the Council, which I think has an extraordinarily difficult task in front of it. Without being negative, which I was not, in agreeing with some of the comments made by Opposition speakers in this debate I said in my contribution to the second reading debate that I feel real limits will necessarily be placed on how this Council can function, and these may well fall far short of the expectations of many people intimately connected with the final outcome of this debate. Senator O'Chee said that it was necessary to establish these benchmarks so that the Council could `get it right the first time'. I think it is probably highly unlikely that the Council will get it right the first time.
       </para>
       <para>
        To save time I will deal with all the amendments, including the ones on sitting fees, while I speak. Senator O'Chee mentioned the system of program budgeting. Senator Baume made a great contribution to the institution of program budgeting. I support program budgeting; I have been an adherent of it for years, and when I was a member of the Northern Territory Parliament I was very keen to see it happen. Indeed, I am pleased to say that the Northern Territory Government was one of the first governments in Australia to introduce the system of setting performance targets and having government departments be accountable in terms of how they met and tested those targets.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, all of us who participate in Estimates committees know how difficult it is for the concept of program budgeting to be met in areas that deal with social justice. It is not that they cannot do it, but it is difficult to do it. It is very easy to introduce a program budgeting system, for example, in transport and works; if one has a budget of $600m a year and the target is to build X miles of road with it, it is easy to find out whether the money has been spent wisely and whether one has the required result. However, if I could just take what was formerly the Department of Aboriginal Affairs-now the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-it is often extremely difficult, with the best will in the world, to set real performance indicators that actually serve some purpose to achieve a result on the amount of money spent that year in Aboriginal Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can all determine what those desirable performance indicators are and I am sure we would all come up with the same ones because they are crude tools at best. We would all say that some of the benchmarks we should set in the administration of Aboriginal affairs would be a statistical reduction in the child mortality rate, a statistical reduction in the percentage of Aboriginal people occupying bed space in hospitals, a statistical reduction in the percentage of Aboriginal people who are inmates of our prison system and a statistical increase in the number of Aboriginal students achieving matriculation results, entrance to university and successful qualification on the gaining of degrees at the end of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are benchmarks that I am sure the Aboriginal community, as well as the non-Aboriginal community, would agree are reasonable to set. They are more appropriately set-and are difficult enough to achieve even then-in the administration of Aboriginal affairs itself. It is an almost impossible task, with respect, at this point-when it has not even started-to set any meaningful benchmarks in an organisation which has the difficult, political and subjective task in front of it of trying to get some kind of meaningful reconciliation between the Aboriginal and the non-Aboriginal community in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Baume enunciated for me in his original speech supporting these amendments the reason the Government at this point does not feel it is helpful to have benchmarks included in the legislation, and that is that under part 3 of the Bill the Council is required to develop a written strategy-it is required to set out its targets, in other words. It will become very obvious, very quickly I think, once it is put on paper, whether those targets are being met, whether benchmarks are set up or not. For that reason-I do not think that I am misinterpreting what Senator Baume said; it was the gravamen of his last remarks-the Government will not be supporting the amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, I understand the import of what Senator Baume said about sitting fees, and I do not disagree with him. It is an area in which I have some personal experience. The difficulty with not allowing sitting fees is this: in the Aboriginal community with which I am familiar the same people, for obvious reasons, always tend to get picked by the Aboriginal community, as well as the non-Aboriginal community, to take on the responsible and onerous jobs of representing the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tambling knew, probably as well as I did, Silas Roberts, a very prominent Aboriginal figure in the Northern Territory who was literally-this is literally the truth-worked to death. He died at an early age, regrettably, from stress-in terms of my own knowledge of him-because he was on everything. He was appointed as the first Aboriginal magistrate and he was a member of the Aboriginal benefits trust association. We all know what happens. There is a lot of stress and a lot of pressure on a very small group of people who are capable of performing these roles.
       </para>
       <para>
        A common situation is that a prominent person who works for the community is paid a wage by the community. He is on half a dozen important councils of direct involvement to that community's interests. He has constantly to go away to attend meetings of these councils. The communities themselves, with extremely limited budgets-I can assure honourable senators that Aboriginal communities do get very stringent local budgets-cannot afford, in terms of the often prolonged absences of these key people, not to replace them when they go away; they have to put people in their place to do the job. They then have to find funding for this. Usually people do this without pay. There was a very discriminatory situation where we literally could not get Aboriginal people to serve on some of these important councils because their employers were not in a position to continue paying them their salaries-nor was there any reasonable reason why they should have done so-while they were away from their job for prolonged periods. That is the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope the result will be that those people on this Council who can afford not to receive the sitting fees will feel inclined-they might even do it collegiately-to donate their sitting fees to some worthy Aboriginal cause or organisation. Frankly, that is what I would do if I were appointed to such a council. Inevitably, there will be people who rightly should be considered for a place on this Council who simply cannot afford to do so because they will have to vacate their employment to be involved in something which will take up a fairly significant amount of time. The decision to introduce sitting fees was taken finally to avoid that discrimination. I hope that those who do not need the sitting fees will not keep them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, the Government-I know that I speak on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs when I say this-greatly welcomes and appreciates the reasons that Senator Baume gave for there being no divisions in this debate. We accept absolutely the strength that the Opposition places on these amendments. We do not take the view that it is not serious about them because it is not dividing on them. On behalf of the Government, I thank the Opposition for the reasons given publicly for there being no divisions on this legislation. It is greatly appreciated.

         â€”Over 300,000 people are employed in the road transport industry in Australia. Their very livelihood and the livelihood of the many thousands more servicing the industry and, indeed, the well-being of the whole nation, depend on the industry's ability to make sensible changes to enhance a safe and efficient road transport industry. The Senate has before it two Bills on which hinge the future of the road transport industry in this country, namely, the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill. If this legislation is not handled correctly, the industry, which is responsible for over 80 per cent of all freight movements in Australia, will emerge dispirited and disunited. This is something which must not be allowed to happen.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In handling these Bills for the Opposition, let me make it clear that the coalition will support the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill, which allows for the introduction of B-doubles on Federal designated routes. However, we will seek to amend administrative aspects of this Bill at the committee stage to remove an inappropriate delegation of ministerial power. We will oppose the second reading of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991 in the form of an amendment setting out all our particular concerns. I will move such an amendment at the end of my remarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apparently, deals have been done by the Government with certain members of the national trucking industry. This is true to form. This Government is renowned for its partisan deals and fixes. The coalition was hoping that this legislation would focus on measures to increase national efficiency and international competitiveness and to move towards a more rational, national approach, instead of one impeded by obstacles put in place by State boundaries and individual State administrations. We hoped that the focus would target micro-economic reform in the area of road transport, but our hopes were forlorn.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both these Bills were debated in the other place in early June under Government guillotine. As we know only too well, this prevented Australia's elected representatives from carrying out the job for which they are elected-that is, to participate in the serious debate of legislation before this Parliament-legislation required for an industry which is in dire need of urgent and desperate reform; legislation which should not be shunted through either the Senate or the other place in a matter of a few hours under the cover of tiredness after long hours of business or with waning interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such legislation deserves a thorough investigation and analysis so that the problems of the industry can be dealt with diligently and with long term gains in mind. In the other place the Government muzzled debate because it did not want the issue in the spotlight, so we must ensure that in this place adequate time is devoted to effective debate of this very important legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the other place, the Government did not want the Australian public to see highlighted its impoverished mismanagement of what passes for our national road strategy because it is typical of how this rapidly decaying Government operates on all levels. In initiating this program there was delay after delay from a leader who wanted to bask in the light of eminence and renown just one more time at the recent Special Premiers Conference before he was swept from office.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991, as it is now presented, will allow B-doubles-double-bottomed trailers or, to the uninitiated, a prime mover with two trailers hitched-to operate under the Federal interstate registration scheme on designated routes. At long last, this means that these trucks will be able to operate right round Australia.

        In bygone years, this soon to be bygone Government had the opportunity to introduce B-doubles nationally; it did not. Labor remained the last of the great regulators. It did not want these trucks moving out of the city zones, out of the delivery circuits ringing major centres. It wanted its inept railway union mates to get a slice of the action. It did not work, and now this Government is trying to make up for lost time while simultaneously dismantling the industry. The Government must have known for certain that allowing the introduction of these trailers would improve industry efficiency, but the question which will never be answered is why it has taken this tardy and tired Government so long to inch towards reform in the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The operation of B-doubles under the Federal interstate registration scheme will obviate the need to obtain State permits-to date, a cumbersome and expensive, repetitive exercise. It will obviate that old trucking game-playing with the bureaucracy. Every time a truck needed to cross a State border or called into a weighbridge station, essential and necessary pieces of paper would fly around the truckie's cabin so that the truck could proceed and all would be well. Trucks may as well travel through foreign borders for the number of different State regulations they have to endure in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Northern Territory has been living with double and triple-bottoms for many years, but the Federal Government has been dithering about uniformly introduced B-doubles across Australia since 1985. Finally, it has been disgraced into taking action. After all, the United States has had B-doubles for 15 years, and innumerable isolated and remote communities across the United States have been benefiting from their advantages all this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has long been recognised that the larger truck configurations are necessary to protect both the consumer and the community at large. The bigger the rig, the more freight that can be carried per tonne of pressure on the road, because the prime mover remains static and, as the size of the configuration is extended, the overall weight is less per tonnes of freight on board. In terms of road damage, that is very important.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even three years ago the Inter-State Commission recommended that B-doubles be introduced as soon as practicable. As with countless other recommendations, no urgent action was ever taken, and now this Government on the nose has the temerity to announce such changes with gala fanfare, as though an innovation. Because of this short-sighted Government's ineptitude, over $1 billion has been lost to date in its battles with rail freight unions at the expense of the national trucking industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us recall that last year the railways in Australia lost $4 billion. That is more than State, local and Commonwealth governments combined spend on roads-$4 billion thrown to the wind. In fact, if the VicRail passenger transport system were closed today, sufficient money would be saved to purchase its regular commuters economical cars to drive themselves to work. Governments cannot go on spending that kind of money, and they certainly should not tax the shirts off the backs of the members of the transport industry as a quid pro quo for extending their network.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only as we are being catapulted into the next century does this Government think it is about time to get a national rail freight centre up and running. By the time all the States fight the Commonwealth over that one, we will have arrived at the next century. By the time each State has decided what it has to gain and lose with rail freight, we can bet that another couple of years will have passed and nothing will have changed. By the time the rail unions have their slice, we can be assured that nothing will change.
       </para>
       <para>
        When comparisons are made between B-doubles and conventionally articulated vehicles, the payload differential is some 11 tonnes. This represents productivity gains of some 40 per cent and efficiency gains of some 20 per cent overall after investment and operating costs are deducted. Cheaper costs should then be passed on to the consumer, and cheaper consumption goods mean more competitive exports for Australia. Even savings estimates of $250m per annum do not manage to convince this Government that it has made a serious error of judgment in delaying the introduction of B-doubles nationally-on these figures, $1.5 billion because of that delay alone.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from consumer savings, there are savings on road wear costs per payload tonne-down 20 per cent for B-doubles when compared with articulated vehicles. Another aspect of the introduction of B-doubles, which may have been overlooked, comes from a study by the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities. It projected that up to 16 lives could be saved and 50 severe accidents could be avoided with the appearance of B-doubles on national roads.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is because of the greater efficiency of these vehicles. Only 27 B-doubles are needed to carry 1,000 tonnes, but 38 conventionally articulated trucks are required to carry the same tonnage. So, in plain terms, the introduction of B-doubles would reduce the number of trucks on the roads. With improved road safety, less congestion, less noise and exhaust gases to cope with, all road users would gain.
       </para>
       <para>
        The particular concern of the coalition with this legislation, however, relates to the increase in fines for overloading. There are too many inconsistencies between the States in regard to the laws associated with overloading. While some States are almost draconian in their pursuit of overloading and the enforcement process, other States reflect a more lenient approach, especially in regard to unintentional overloading. Trucking operators, if they can pull more freight with the same rig, will not have to drive so fast to make a living. Hence there will be less incentive to overload, with the resulting beneficial effect of less road damage. So a number of conflicts will have to be thoroughly overhauled before this legislation can be truly reflective of a national road strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second Bill, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill, seeks to change the present system, which allows only road maintenance costs to be taken into account in determining registration charges, and to limit registration charges which can be imposed on vehicles registered under the Federal interstate registration scheme. Hence the amendments enable the determination of Federal interstate registration scheme charges to be based on full cost recovery, taking into account construction and maintenance costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition opposes this Bill, and I have circulated a second reading amendment which summarises our opposition. Charging for B-doubles should be considered in the context of the Special Premiers Conference held recently. By separating B-doubles from the charging regime discussions, the Government continues the ad hoc method of charging and road maintenance that has plagued the road system for years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note reports in this morning's press that cars are also now under consideration for inclusion in that scheme, again demonstrating the adhockery and the inconsistency in the development of this system. Their needs to be, in fact, consideration of the introduction of a complete and final package before any part of the package is introduced. Charging should be considered as a total package, since to have a relatively high cost attached to B-double operation will inhibit their introduction in the short run, at great cost to the wider community.
       </para>
       <para>
        As usual, the Government has been contemptuous on this issue. After many years of dithering and procrastination, it has agreed to introduce a Federal interstate registration scheme, but after a slight pause it continues to tell us and the industry that it will hit operators for six and go for full cost recovery. That does not mean just the cost of daily wear and tear, but the actual costs associated with road construction.
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one knows what these figures will eventually total. To date, the Government has not announced any specific figures-although I believe it has its best bean counters working on it-yet it seeks to impose a crippling financial burden on an industry which, I believe, already pays. As honourable senators may know, the special Premiers Conference agreed to the establishment of a national vehicle registration regulation and charging scheme. All, except the Northern Territory, agreed to the changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The focus of this new scheme is the establishment of a National Road Transport Commission to regulate heavy vehicles on a nationally uniform basis and to develop a heavy vehicle charging scheme. With regard to the charging scheme, the coalition agrees in principle-as do many in the industry-that road pricing should be on a more rational basis. However, we believe that it should be done on a fair basis. There are some very real concerns about the wording of the Premiers Conference communique.
       </para>
       <para>
        First of all, the road charging principles outlined delineate zones on the basis of State borders. It is not clear that the difference between remote areas in New South Wales and Victoria and remote areas in other States requires that those areas should face differing charges. The coalition has repeatedly called for an economic impact statement on the effect of the changes on rural and remote areas before any are finalised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, it appears that the mass distance charges are based on average mass and average distance for different types of trucks while the actual classifications of trucks are yet to be specified. Imposing the average on large chunks of the road transport industry will prove to be extremely unfair to many operators, particularly those who travel only short distances. Thirdly, the actual specifications of how frequent the mass distance charge payments will be are not clear. An up-front payment for the whole year, based on averages, may prove to be too onerous for many operators.

        The industry argues that it already more than covers the cost of the roads that its drivers travel on, since it pays 3.5 times as much tax as any other industry. According to the Inter-State Commission Report on road user charging and vehicle registration, this claim is, in fact, confirmed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Any review of charging should be done in the context of a review of the total tax burden on the industry. The road transport industry forum indicated in its document Blueprint for Industry Reform that the industry should, at most, only have to pay for the maintenance costs caused by the wear that road transport causes to the road network. All construction costs should be met out of Consolidated Revenue. It argues that the industry should only have to pay an amount equal to the private benefit gained from having roads constructed to a standard to carry heavy vehicles. The remaining construction costs should be paid out of Consolidated Revenue, as all the community benefits from it. The blueprint also outlines the need for a better understanding of the industry.

        More than 80 per cent of all freight in Australia is carried by road. Irrespective of any rail reforms, it will continue to service the vast majority of local, regional and national requirements. It is not just the industry operators who pay; it is the users of the payloads who pay-farmers, manufacturers, businesses, individuals. If we had a superior and efficient rail freight network, these additional costs would not exist. The rail system would pay its own way and not be subsidised to the hilt.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government does not agree. It says that the road industry still does not pay enough. Yet there is a vast array of data to give testimony to the fact that an ordinary owner driver pays 33 per cent of his revenue in tax, in one form or another. If all contributions that operators pay were directed to roads-keeping in mind that billions of dollars are paid out in road transport around the country-we certainly would not have to worry about the standard of our roads. In fact, we could probably have cars on the road with no registration fees at all. Also, Mr and Mrs Average car driver would not have to pay through the nose for the privilege of driving on our shabby roads. It is worth remembering that on the whole, since our nation has become more mobile, most roads have been constructed with the motor car in mind. They will still shadow snaking railway lines around this country for a long time to come.

       <para>
        The coalition wants impartiality. That is why we want road transport-especially B-doubles-not to go the way of the dinosaur, and not to be taxed within an inch of its life. It will be found that in past years many operators have paid sales tax of about 50 cents a tonne on tyres alone to move tonnage about 1,500 kilometres. The Government cannot tell me that road transport does not pay its way; it certainly does. Operators pay, and the coalition is reluctant to see this chamber agree to any additional imposts placed on the industry before we even know what those imposts will be-and certainly before massive changes are made in the rail freight industry and this Government's snug deal with its railway union mates is eliminated.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should not-we cannot-agree to a litany of charges imposing cost recovery when the Government has not even worked out what they will be. That is sheer lunacy. We will wait and we will decide when the beans are on the table. The coalition is not against user pays. We are in favour of it. However, the transport industry is already slugged with costs which have sent many of its operators and supporters to the wall in recent years. Now the Government presents us with this legislation for which, essentially, it has no cost figures. If it has no cost figures, how can it make a case for charges to recover those costs?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is no wonder that the transport industry was uncertain about discussions at the recent special Premiers Conference. There is little doubt that additional costs imposed on the trucking industry will be immediately passed on to the consumer, if these truckies are to stay in business. They will not wear them. Why should they? The users of the road transport network will leave in droves. As the only other choice is rail, that really is no choice at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent weeks we have heard the President of the Road Transport Federation, Mr Peter Rocke, express his concern about additional road costs. He proposes that they will most certainly be passed on to consumers. Where is the sense in that? It is simply adding to the overall costs of operation and costs of industry inputs. This Government may just as well place a direct tax on individual consumers. It could call it a negligence tax because it has totally neglected the national freight movement for so long.

        Even Wayne Goss, Queensland's Labor Premier-a Labor premier who thinks, at least sometimes-was concerned when the proposal was put forward. Perhaps the Prime Minister should listen to him. Wayne Goss claimed that it would have a very damaging effect on regional Australia, with a huge cost burden not just for the transport industry but for significant rural industries. It would also mean a substantial increase in the cost of living in regional Queensland. Premier Goss is right. He knows that Queensland could not survive on regional freight centres alone-it is not practical for such an expanse of territory. Nor could the west. The Northern Territory has fewer than 200 kilometres of rail to the South Australian border and no railway east or north. Similarly, in my own State of South Australia, Eyre Peninsula, which lacks a rail link to the rest of the State, would be hit to leg.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even the Queensland Premier estimates that the costs of these proposals for various rural industries will add up to tens of millions of dollars each and, in some cases, increase the cost of living by between one per cent and 4 per cent, depending on where one lives in Queensland. Of course, the same effects will be felt in other remote parts of Australia- in the Northern Territory and in South Australia and Western Australia especially. This heartless, indeed mindless, Government has chosen conveniently to ignore the impact which these cost burdens will have on industries and individuals cornered by this ill conceived legislation.

        We have heard that an interim commission is to be established by September this year to assist in developing legislation and to begin work on regulation, registration and charging issues. We are told that planning is to commence immediately to interlink the existing set of motor registries, allow for the automatic exchange of defect notices, allow a simplified number plate system and facilitate the development of registration procedures so that information on all heavy vehicles is available nationally by July next year. Additionally, the Federal interstate registration scheme is to be subsumed into the national heavy vehicles scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The complete detail of the discussions relating to the charging structures is not known to me, but it would appear that the following has emerged from the July Special Premiers Conference: a charging structure is to be implemented comprising a nominal administration charge, a road use charge component of Commonwealth diesel excise and a registration or mass distance charge for vehicles which do not meet their road costs through fuel payments alone.
       </para>
       <para>
        The road use part of diesel excise is to be structured to avoid the administratively cumbersome imposition of registration or mass distance charges on a significant proportion of the vehicle fleet. The registration charge is to be applied to heavy vehicles where it would be inequitable; that is, it would involve significant over recovery for other vehicles if they covered their road costs by fuel charges alone.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apparently, charges are always to be set: firstly, to recover fully distributed road costs, thereby achieving full recovery of all road costs by minimising over recovery from any vehicle class; secondly, to determine and collect charges in a way that achieves a reasonable balance between administrative simplicity, efficiency and equity in the charging structure; thirdly, to improve pricing, leading to a better allocation of resources with investment decisions being based on more relevant demand signals; and, fourthly, to minimise the incentive for operators to `shop around' for lower charges and undermine the integrity of the national charging system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister and this Government are just isolating one group of road users and trying to tax them off our roads. I do not believe that it is consistent, nor morally right, that these trucks should be charged at a different rate from other trucks already using the roads which will be their competitors. The Government knows full well that these trucks will be a direct competitor with the interstate rail system, so the Minister just blows them off the road. He has become the Mad Max of the Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Minister that in 1988 the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, gave a guarantee to members of the transport industry that an inquiry into registration charges would take into account the relative cost recovery and efficiency performance of equivalent rail services and all fuel product excise payments by the industry. That is clearly an undertaking which has yet to be taken up. The Minister stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will retain the principles included in the existing legislation that the Federal registration charges are determined on the basis of road damage and that the practice of including limits on the level of charges in the legislation will be continued.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was three years ago. It would appear that the Minister has forgotten it in the case of applying these principles to B-doubles. If the Government does deal with certain groups within the trucking industry and pits conventional articulated vehicle operators against B-double operators, it is doing the whole industry a grave disservice.
       </para>
       <para>
        A prime mover that pulls a B-double can just as easily pull a single articulated trailer. That is why the coalition wants a second reading amendment requiring charging rates for B-doubles consistent with the charging rates for other semitrailers and heavy vehicles that are registered under the Federal interstate registration system. Despite this, the coalition reservedly supports the principles of the legislation, even if they have been a long time coming.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister knows his Government should have taken action years ago, but that is not enough to win our support for this Bill. Legislation should not be enacted until there is a consistent approach and a comprehensive set of charges. It is a great pity that, at the same time, a rail network strategy will not be put in place so the two transport networks could complement each other instead of cutting each others throats while suffering loathing and contempt.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those intervening years have left a legacy of bankruptcies, a lack of industry confidence, poor productivity and spiralling costs for an industry which should have been treated better from the outset. Australia is too large for either just the railways to move goods to and fro or for road operators to transport tonnage. A national trucking strategy is long overdue for this country and it should have the capacity to make major contributions in micro-economic reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister knows that its difficult birth has cost this country over $1 billion, but at the same time he wants to tax the new baby before it is even in nappies. That is why the coalition cannot support this legislation.

        We want to see further initiatives in tackling the problems associated with the National Rail Freight Centre; we want to see the railways made efficient freight movers; we want to see the railways begin to show some returns; we want to see rationalisation of their manning levels; and we want the road transport system and the rest of the country to stop paying for the legacy of ineptitude evident in our railways. Australia just simply cannot afford any inefficiencies in any part of the transport industry.

        We cannot afford to have our most efficient transport sector being unfairly treated while the inefficient ones are allowed to continue to cost the country billions of dollars.

         â€”I am pleased to support the comments of my colleague Senator Chapman in addressing the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991. The implications and ramifications of the issues that will flow from this legislation are far reaching and will have a dramatic effect on all Australians. In particular, I would like to speak for those Australians who live in rural and remote Australia.

        It is evident from the recent Premiers Conference that neither the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) nor any State Premier knows or understands the economic impact of these proposals at the supermarket shelf. Really, that is where it has to count. We in the Senate represent ordinary, average Australian families. To increase road freight registration charges by almost 3,000 per cent within the next nine years, without taking into account the consequential cost flow-ons that will affect people living in rural and remote Australia, is, indeed, a very serious matter.

       <para>
        The cross-subsidies being forced on rural and remote regions to subsidise the highly urbanised States and their congested and often ineffective road transport systems certainly need major review. My colleague the shadow Minister for land transport, David Hawker, has continually called for an economic assessment and review to take into account the issues that must be addressed in rural and remote Australia and in particular, any new charging regime that applies to the trucking industry. It is obvious that the Government is not serious in addressing this particular issue.

        From 24 to 26 March, I attended a conference in Alice Springs organised by the Federal Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy under the chairmanship and the auspices of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, Warren Snowdon. That conference put down a heck of a lot of issues needing serious consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reviewing the report subsequently prepared from that conference, it is interesting to read through the main issues and the recommendations that arose. The chapter headings are: The Significance of Rural and Remote Australia; Planning and Coordination of the Transport Infrastructure and Services in Rural and Remote Australia; Transport Infrastructure, Funding and Charging; Consultation; Uniformity of Regulations; Community Service Obligations; Taxation and Charges Applying to Rural and Remote Areas; Rural Incomes; and Prices of Fuel and Other Household Items.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report is comprehensive. It outlines the concerns of many of the participants, the great majority of whom were public servants drawn either from the Federal or State bureaucracies throughout Australia. I was concerned that a press release that was put out at the time of the report's release by the chairman of the conference, Warren Snowdon, highlighted only three particular elements of a proposed strategy. They were, to quote from Mr Snowdon's press release: research to begin shortly to identify impacts to consumers and primary producers in rural and remote Australia of the overarching group's recommendations; the Federal Government to recommend at the Special Premiers Conference that no binding decisions on actual charging levels will be made until the results of this research are known; and to recommend to State and Territory governments that proposals to introduce special treatment for rural and remote areas such as zonal arrangements be seriously considered in the light of the research findings. These are pious words from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look in detail at the report, both at the executive summary and at the recommendations, it is interesting to note that there were not three points put forward by that conference but in fact 24 specific recommendations. Those recommendations, which were important for government to consider, looked not only at the impact on living standards and the existing transport infrastructure but also at the issues that would impact on business, industry, primary production and on people who live in the remote areas of Australia.

        The document read as follows-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
       </para>
       <para>
        The ``Transport in Rural and Remote Australia Conference'' was instigated to provide a forum for government, industry and community representatives to discuss transport and transport related issues in rural and remote Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Conference emphasised the economic, social and cultural significance of rural and remote areas to Australia as a nation and urged continued commitment to the principles embodied in the Prime Minister's 1989 Rural and Regional Statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Specific consideration was given to current issues, in particular the Interstate Commission Report on ``Road User Charging-A National Scheme''. The Conference strongly urged detailed analysis of the likely impact on rural and remote communities of the ISC report and related proposals. The Conference supported immediate research and ongoing monitoring of road user charges to provide adequate information for governments, to decide whether any steps are needed to ameliorate significant adverse effects on regions or industry sectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Longer term structural and policy directions were also discussed and three major issues identified.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, the Conference strongly urged all governments to implement more extensive and more appropriate consultation with a broader spectrum of representatives of rural and remote areas. The Conference acknowledged the role of industry peak bodies but argued that consultation should also extend to regionalised representatives and local community groups. Delegates believed that it was important that this consultation be done in a more appropriate timeframe so that those groups being consulted would have adequate time to consider and comment on proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Delegates believed that this consultation would address the second major issue arising from the Conference, that is the need for detailed assessment and appropriate consideration of the impact of policies in rural areas before implementation. Delegates stressed that policy makers need to acknowledge that particular policies may impact on different areas in significantly different ways as a result of the social, economic, physical and infrastructure characteristics of the areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly the Conference urged greater attention be given to options for integrating the planning and coordination of transport and transport related policies in rural and remote areas. The Conference stressed the benefits of planning decisions more closely reflecting local economic and social needs, and the need for greater coordination in investment and policy decisions by providers of transport and transport related and complementary services and infrastructure, to enable the most appropriate and most cost effective services to be provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Conference stressed that this was particularly important in addressing community service obligations in rural and remote areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The prices of fuel and other household items were also of concern to the Conference and delegates questioned the effectiveness of the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme and the adequacy of other compensatory mechanisms such as tax zone rebates in addressing consistently higher prices in these areas.

It was a conference that the Department and the Government set up to solicit those particular views; a conference that the Government asked for that report; a conference that the Government funded totally, at some considerable cost; and a conference at which the participants were primarily Federal bureaucrats or State bureaucrats with a particular interest in the transport portfolio.

        As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I represent the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Government was the only government that stood aside from the recent agreement between the Prime Minister and the Premiers on land transport. I note that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Marshall Perron, has quite strongly taken the view that the impacts of the decision that has been taken primarily by the Prime Minister and forced on the Australian community do need to be addressed.

        Senator Chapman has today outlined all of the issues that impact on this particular proposal. Whether they are in the associated transport fields of railway or shipping, it is interesting to note that the Commonwealth has continually reneged on its promises to the Northern Territory for a period going back some 80 years. In 1911, the Commonwealth made a commitment to complete the rail link from Alice Springs to Darwin. In the Northern Territory we are still waiting for that promise to be honoured. It is only when we get independent governments that seek to put that in place with commercial interests that there will be any hope that in the future we will see an alternative rail system which would then bring the Northern Territory into a system that could act in concert and in partnership with the rest of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not just the Northern Territory that will feel the impacts of this legislation and these government decisions. This legislation will have very serious impacts on Queensland, which you represent, Mr Acting Deputy President, and also on Western Australia. There are important industries that will be affected. Over 40 per cent of Australia's export industries come from northern Australia. The financial implications of those transport arrangements are crucial to the industries that have to survive in that part of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are thousands of Australians who choose to associate themselves with these industries and to live in and develop the north, central and outback parts of Australia, which will feel very adversely the effects of these charges. Aboriginal communities in outback Australia are almost entirely dependent on Federal Government funding in one form or another. It is an irony that the additional charges and costs will in another way be thrown back onto the Federal Government budgeting through other portfolios.
       </para>
       <para>
        The issues addressed in this legislation are important. They have wide ramifications; they must be given serious consideration by the Government and they must be comprehensively addressed in next week's Federal Budget.

         â€” I do not think that the real land transport debate that we are having here should be about whether we discriminate between one type of heavy vehicle and another. The real debate we should be having is: what is the best environmentally responsible land transport for Australia for the future? On the way to achieving that goal, the Australian Democrats are prepared to support this attempt by the Government to encourage the road haulage industry-and we are not talking here about small owner operators, we are talking about big, expensive vehicles and big industries-to contribute towards the full cost recovery of road maintenance and construction.

        We understand that the proposed annual registration fee will initially be set at $12,000. That is a fee which puts the Federal registration fee on a par with the New South Wales Government registration and charges for B-double vehicles. We do not accept the Opposition's argument that B-doubles should be charged at the same rate as other articulated vehicles under the Federal interstate registration scheme.

         â€”I will answer Senator Panizza in a moment. We see the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill as a piecemeal attempt by the Government to impose full road cost recovery, including environmental costs, on the transport industry. That is a really important principle in the whole debate about land transport reform. This is not an easy task, and we acknowledge that, but we do not accept the argument that we should not do anything yet.

        We cannot support a second reading attachment that seeks to delay a process, the ultimate goal of which we believe in. That really is too much to expect, and Senator Panizza would know that. We cannot sit back and expect a transport industry to willingly relinquish the hidden subsidies that the taxpayers have been providing for years. They are indirect subsidies via the running down of the railways of this nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, and the Opposition when it was in government, ran down the railways at the expense of the growth of road transport. Land transport accounts for more than 20 per cent of Australia's emission of greenhouse gases. Most of this is due to the use of some 16,000 million litres of petrol a year. To rescue our future, Australia must reduce these emissions by more than 90 per cent by the year 2030, as the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology recognised was necessary in its 1991 report.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our national accounting system has never acknowledged the need to incorporate the true social and financial costs of road crashes, road congestion, noise pollution and the emission of 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gases. Yet, they are costs which can be directly attributed to the ever-increasing number of vehicles, including heavy vehicles, on our roads. Road freight is estimated to have grown fourfold from 15 to 60 billion tonne kilometres in the years 1971 to 1988, and is expected to double by the year 2000. Factor that into our national accounting system.

        Heavy trucks have increased the amount of diesel fuel used from 1,370 million litres a year in 1976 to 3,500 million litres a year in 1988. That, at least, is one cost which is measurable.

         â€”Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. He is really a very courteous person. At the same time, Australia's self-sufficiency in petroleum is expected to decline from near 90 per cent to between 20 and 50 per cent by the year 2000. It is estimated that by the year 2000 Australia will be spending between $3.6 billion and $5.9 billion every year on oil imports.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have seen transport investment policies that continue a bias in favour of energy wasteful, oil dependent activities which are likely to have a crippling effect on our balance of payments within the next 20 years. Yet, fuel savings resulting not from having more B-doubles and fewer articulated vehicles on the road but from the use of rail transport as opposed to road transport can be up to four times greater. So, not only social and environmental costs but also financial commonsense justify revitalising a national system of rail freight.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Government in its Energy 2000 report noted that shifts from long distance road transport to rail or sea would be more likely if there were full recovery of road costs due to heavy trucks. The Government's best intentions to establish by 1 July 1991 the National Rail Freight Corporation in recognition of this seem to have sunk in a quagmire of conflicting interests. Action is urgently required. I know that my own home State of Queensland has been somewhat obstreperous in this process.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats argue that this Government has exaggerated the financial problems facing rail transport. We think it has placed too much emphasis on the micro-economic cure-alls of labour productivity and on the miracle of full road cost recovery. But it has not paid sufficient attention to the more efficient solutions such as the expansion of government rail systems or even the technical aspects of running trains efficiently. In fact, this Federal Government has spent so little on rail that it is currently in receipt of net revenue from Australia's railways.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Government's allocations to the States for rail investment in the eight years of this Labor Government have declined by 80 per cent. The Federal Government's spending on roads has increased to a massive $10.851 billion compared with $505m on rail; that is, less than 5 per cent of the money allocated to roads has been allocated to rail.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures are even more disgraceful when we realise that the $500m includes the revenue supplement paid to Australian National Railways. This subsidy paid to Australian National has totalled over $500m during this Government's term of office. If these payments are excluded, it is clear that the Commonwealth's contribution to the improvement of this nation's rail system has been close to zero. Although railways perform about 43 per cent of Australia's land freight transport task, compared with 60 per cent in the gas guzzling United States, they have received only 4 per cent of Commonwealth allocations for land transport investment during the past 20 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        From 1983 to 1988, the railways paid $436m to the Commonwealth in fuel excise, of which $105m has been calculated by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Railways Union as having gone directly into road funding. So do not let us hear the Opposition stand up here and say that there have been no subsidies. There certainly have been indirect subsidies to road transport in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 1983, the Commonwealth Government has spent about $730m on improving the Hume Highway but not one dollar on the adjacent Sydney-Melbourne mainline railway; that is, more than $10 billion to roads and nothing to rail. These figures show a Government bias towards road funding at the expense of railways. Put another way, it shows bias towards road haulage big business at the expense of the national interest. I think the Government has recognised this imbalance.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen many announcements about a land transport program but, in the hiatus between what the Federal Government says it intends to do and what it has not yet done, the cash starved State railways are closing country rail with damaging social costs to rural communities and the Australian National Line is pulling up railway lines and forcing staple rail cargoes on to the road. There is no coordination here. The Federal Government is setting up a national freight system; State governments are closing them down; and rural communities are left with no choice but to use road transport.
       </para>
       <para>
        National Rail Freight Corporation or not, the Government should, by now, have reached a stage where it is prepared to commit investment to interstate mainline upgrading along the lines recommended by the national freight initiative of 1990. There should be minimum requirements for improved freight terminals in the five mainland State capitals plus very basic track work, along with Adelaide-Melbourne gauge standardisation. It should be working to bring the Sydney-Melbourne line to fast freight train standards. I know the Government has been arguing for `user pays'; so has the Opposition. That is fine. The Government could make a start by using the $500m or more that the railways have paid to the Commonwealth in fuel excise to fund the basic upgrading of the lines I have just mentioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia cannot afford to wait the years it will take for the diverse vested interests in the trucking industry and the States to agree to low road cost recovery payments for heavy trucks. We cannot afford to wait for the five States to agree to relinquish their constitutional powers over the railways. Unless the Federal Government acts now to outlay for the basic minimum requirement to get freight back on the railway track, the deficit on interstate rail freight operations in Australia will remain high, resulting in more and more trucks-probably B-doubles-on our major highways, more pollution, more road trauma and the disappearance of almost all our regional rail trunk routes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I welcome the report that registration fees for cars could be scrapped and replaced by increased petrol taxes under a plan to establish a national uniform system of charges and regulations for all passenger vehicles. To us, this is the ultimate user pays because users are paying proportionately for their consumption of the resources of this nation. Before we anticipate too much noise from Opposition speakers about how this will result in registration charges of something like $55,000, let me read the following report in the Australian Financial Review:
       </para>
       <para>
        But officials yesterday indicated that the proposals put before the premiers had suggested that the highest rate for heavy vehicles be about $7,000 . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        While the system would be revenue-neutral, the standardisation of registration charges would see more vehicles paying the top rate while lighter vehicles would actually have their rate reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a complex issue. We have a long way to go. There is a place for both road and rail in this country. Certainly rail has been disadvantaged. It holds the key to the future and we must look very seriously at implementing the many reports we have seen which tell us what needs to be done urgently. We must take action as soon as we can, and we must hope that we will see greater cooperation from the States.

I have listened to the contributions of previous speakers. Before Senator Kernot leaves the chamber I would like to ask her: does rail not use fuel?

        This Bill amends the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and provides for the registration and regulation of prime movers-I emphasise `prime movers'; they are not trailers-which are to be used as part of the B-double combination under the Federal interstate registration scheme. The amendments further provide for the regulation of those vehicles and State registered trailers. If I read the legislation correctly, only the prime movers will be registered under the new system; trailers will still be registered under the State system when operating as part of a B-double combination. Of course, operation of the B-double under the Federal interstate registration scheme will obviate the need to obtain State permits. The amendments provide a head of power to make regulations covering roadworthiness, which is important; designation of routes and technical requirements as to mass limits; dimensions, and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps I should describe a B-double. It is simply a prime mover-say, a six-wheel prime mover-fitted with a turntable on which the first semi-trailer is virtually connected but, because there are two trailers, the second trailer does not have a tow bar and a turntable. The turntable for the back trailer is mounted on the rear of the front trailer. That is how it works. I have operated one myself. It makes the vehicle a lot more roadworthy. The third trailer on a road train tends to move around. Such a vehicle can track a lot better and it is an improvement when taking corners, especially in city areas where the streets and roads are not so wide.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, all States allow for the operation of B-doubles on designated routes. Tasmania is an exception and, up until a few weeks ago, Victoria allowed them only in limited areas; they were not able to operate widely under any regulation. This is what this legislation is all about. If Victoria had played ball in the first place, I believe we would not have had this legislation at this time-we would have waited until the whole new scheme of national registration and regulation had come in.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may remember that a report on grain handling storage some four or five years ago recommended that B-doubles be licensed in Australia. It has taken at least four years to get anywhere near that position. According to some speeches to date and discussions in the media, B-doubles are something new. We have been slow in taking up this concept in Australia. Senator Chapman said that they have been in use in the United States for 15 years. I can state that they have been in use in New Zealand, just on our doorstep, for the last 15 years. I am at a loss to understand why they have not been introduced into Australia before now. However, they seem to be on the way now.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order for the full benefits offered by B-doubles to be realised, it is necessary to operate on a uniform basis across Australia. To date, each State has made its own arrangements. As I have said, Tasmania barred them altogether and Victoria allowed them to be used in only a limited way. The advantage of such vehicles is that, compared with a standard semitrailer which can have a payload of 26 tonnes, a B-double can have up to 37 tonnes. After taking into account additional capital costs for the B-doubles and other operational costs, efficiency improvements will be in the range of 20 per cent. Actual efficiency is 40 per cent, but the extra costs bring it down. Lower transport costs are passed on as reductions. These should amount to about $250m, which will provide cheaper consumer goods and more competitive exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        Road wear has a great bearing on this also. There is much better tracking with a B-double system. A cut in road wear of 20 per cent can occur by using these vehicles rather than conventional large vehicles. B-doubles have a better safety record because of their improved stability, as I have said, and they have a 25 per cent higher roll-over tolerance than conventional vehicles. A study by the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities has predicted that introducing B-doubles throughout Australia would save 16 lives and 50 serious accidents per year.

Only 27 B-doubles are needed to carry 1,000 tonnes, whereas 38 conventional vehicles would have to be used for the same task. This would reduce the increasing number of trucks on the road. We have been told by Senator Kernot that there will be virtually a doubling of trucks on the roads by the year 2000. If this Government's economic performance continues for much longer, I doubt whether there will be any such increases. With these vehicles we will have improved road safety, less congestion, less noise and less exhaust pollution, which Senator Kernot talks about so much. I certainly applaud the move to finally get these B-doubles on the road. As I said before, they have been a long time in coming. If we get them on the road, and we get the rest of the national registration scheme which we were supposed to get some time ago, it will be a great boon to transport in Australia.

         â€”Obviously, this is one area to which the Government is paying some attention. We have introduced a package of measures to provide rural young people with access to services and programs. There are a number of measures, but I think one of the most important ones is the rural youth information service, a general service which helps local young people to make informed decisions about education, training, occupations and their future.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It should be noted that on 8 August, when opening the Hay rural youth information service, Mr Baldwin, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, announced the Government's continued support for the program and also the funding of 13 additional services, bringing the total to 23 services nationally. Together with that and in further recognition of a need in this part of the community, as part of the youth social justice strategy, the youth access centres network, which provides information and advice, also has been expanded-from 53 to 73 nationally. It has also had its direction refocused and now it will concentrate more closely on locational disadvantage, which obviously is one of the problems faced by rural youth.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to this extension of the program, some 30 selected YACs have been funded to expand outreach activities to isolated areas. Furthermore, five mobile youth access centres are being piloted to establish a cost-efficient yet comprehensive service to isolated young people. As I said at the outset, the Government does recognise a need in this area. I have mentioned two major programs that we have in place, but these measures are in addition to other specific programs of assistance, such as the country areas program and Countrylink.

       <para>
        The Opposition knows that, as a government, we are bound by the accord and that we are determined to honour our obligations under the accord. Those opposite know that we have settled a framework agreement with public sector unions to pay accord mark VI which involves the payment of a $12 wage increase for continued award restructuring from 16 May and involves the negotiation, in three tranches, of productivity increases between now and September next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition knows that we have applied, with the unions in the public sector, to the Industrial Relations Commission for the $12. The Opposition knows as well that in that application the Industrial Relations Commission chose to convert our $12 wage application to a 2.5 per cent wage increase. I have to say that I have criticised unabashedly the Industrial Relations Commission for insisting on a 2.5 per cent wage increase instead of a $12 flat wage increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason why I have done so is best illustrated by this case: if a person is an Australian Public Service fat cat on $100,000 per year, 2.5 per cent is worth $2,500; but if a person is a Public Service thin cat on $20,000 per year, it is worth only $500 per year. That is to say, if a person is a thin cat he or she will get $2,000 per year less, but that person will have to pay exactly the same amount for a loaf of bread or the necessities of life as the fat cat does.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the Labor Government is concerned, we think there ought to be some evening out on wage increases and those at the lower end of the wage scale should be entitled to a reasonable increase. If that means that those at the upper end of the wage scale get less, so be it; that is fair. At the lower end of the scale every cent is important. While $12 may not be important to the honourable senator on his salary, $12 is important for someone on $20,000 per year because the value of money is much more vital to that person.

        I now come to the answer to this question. On 9 August I put out a press release which said that I had proposed an offer to Public Service unions. In the wage application yesterday my advocate-the advocate representing the Government-made it clear during the proceedings, as did the ACTU, that that offer in the terms of my agreement was not the offer that was the subject of the application. The application was in a different form and we stood by that application. I refer honourable senators to the transcript of those proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday I put out a press release on the basis of that and acknowledged that; so the record is clear. It is also clear in the record of the proceedings-in fact, in the decision of the Commission-that the Commission recognises the fact that the Government will honour its undertaking to pay a $12 wage increase up until the time of the Commission's order, that is $12 from 16 May, and that that will be a decision, in the end, for Parliament. The Commission recognises that. But it is my intention-let me be unequivocal on this point-to ask the head of the Department of Industrial Relations, who is the delegate for the purposes of the Act, to make a determination to pay $12 back to 16 May in view of yesterday's decision.

         â€”This is a serious international problem in terms of the great volume of this ballast material which is discharged around the world by ships, and which does contain exotic organisms. Unfortunately, there are no simple solutions to the problem. It is not just a matter of ordering vessels to discharge ballast waters taken on board overseas before they reach Australia because if we did that, it would, in turn, cause very serious dangers to the structure and stability of larger vessels.

        In Australia, voluntary guidelines have been in place since February last year covering the discharge of ballast water by foreign vessels visiting Australia. These guidelines are administered by Australian quarantine officials working closely with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. In the international sphere, Australia has taken a leading role in addressing this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        In July, Australia chaired the meeting of the working group of the International Maritime Organisation's committee on marine environment protection, which finalised international guidelines this year on the discharge of ballast water by ships. The guidelines, both local and international, are recognised as an interim measure to allow further research into alternative techniques. I am advised by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority that there has been a very high level of compliance by foreign ships with these guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently, there is an intensive research effort under way involving the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AMSA, the Department of Transport and Communications, CSIRO and industry to examine the scientific, technical, economic and regulatory aspects of ballast control measures. The recent report by the Bureau of Rural Resources reflects part of that effort. It reviews the results of a scientific testing program in a number of ports around Australia to assess the nature of organisms involved with ballast discharge and the dangers they may pose to our own marine life. I understand that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is also conducting research assessing the effectiveness of various chemical and physical methods, such as ultraviolet and heat treatment, of eliminating a range of marine organisms which may be present in ballast water.
       </para>
       <para>
        For some time, the Australian Government has recognised the dangers to marine life from foreign organisms discharged in ships' ballast water. These problems are being addressed by the current intensive research program and active participation in international efforts to reduce this risk to our environment, fishing and aquiculture industries and human health.

Duesburys has confirmed that the proposed course of action is fair and reasonable. I am also advised that all fund members will have the opportunity to speak at the meeting on 19 August.

Toyota Australia has, in the exercise of a great deal of confidence in the Australian economy and the future of the Australian car manufacturing industry, committed to a greenfield site in Altona, Victoria, an investment of $450m, which is a significant investment and the first phase of a coming and further investment in future manufacturing development for this industry. It is an investment which will create a huge number of new jobs and enable a state of the art car to be manufactured for export from Australia. It will bring to this economy a whole range of other skills that will stand us in good stead to develop the manufacturing focus that we have so earnestly required.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The question is: what contribution has the trade union movement made to this project? I think it is true that Toyota Australia would be the first to acknowledge that the ACTU, through its President, Martin Ferguson, has played an important, if not significant, role in encouraging the formation of one union for this greenfield site to have one bargaining unit and to follow through on a range of technological and award restructuring initiatives, which will make it efficient from a work practices and managerial practices point of view. It is an initiative, too, which will underpin this development by providing career pathing and training. So there will be an advancement in remuneration for employees not simply by service but by acquiring new and better qualifications.
       </para>
       <para>
        This investment, which has the significance I have referred to, could not have gone ahead in the way in which it has unless those preconditions were met. It is important that Toyota has publicly acknowledged that. I think it is appropriate that Senator Maguire, coming from a car manufacturing State such as South Australia, should raise this question. It indicates the degree of flexibility that the unions have gone to under the amendments to create a more rationalised union structure, to encourage developments of this significance by rationalising union coverage, cutting out demarcation disputes, having one union and a more efficient enterprise based approach.

I rely on those who are expert, and in this case the expert is the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.

        In the case of the importation of pig meat, AQIS has, over a number of years, gone through a quite rigorous assessment, calling upon both academic and independent professional expertise to make an assessment as to the likely transmissibility of any disease by the importation of what is commonly regarded as Canadian pig meat, but which may be pig meat from other sources. The advice of the Quarantine and Inspection Service at this stage, as I recall it-I cannot be absolutely precise about this because I am now relying on my memory-is that, in certain circumstances, the importation of pig meat from abroad is acceptable in terms of what risk would be run for the transmissibility of diseases into the Australian market. I rely on that assessment, by the professionals best placed to make the judgment, as to likelihood.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that there is a concern about whether these sorts of assessments ought to be used as a non-tariff barrier to trade. Among pig meat producers in Australia, there is-with due respect to them-an insistence that we should make more rigorous than is reasonable our veterinary assessments in order to prevent the free flow of trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator O'Chee and other honourable senators would know that we are committed to an open and transparent process in our assessments on the likelihood of disease transmissibility, and that we are committed to an open trading regime where we will not use as non-tariff barriers or other forms of hidden protection biological assessments or assessments of this nature. If there is any implication that we should perhaps use this for trade purposes, let me dispense with that suggestion immediately in saying that we will not do that; we will continue the open and transparent approach to disease assessment and risk management that we have used in the past.

        By December 1990 the UN had not achieved the relatively modest participation rate target for women of 30 per cent in senior policy and decision-making posts. We, as the Australian Government, have been concerned about this trend. We have continually called for greater efforts to advance the status of women in the UN Secretariat. The statement to the General Assembly in November 1990 on behalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand by the Australian permanent representative to the UN, Dr Peter Wilenski, was particularly critical of the fact that, of the most senior 45 jobs in the Secretariat, only two were held by women.

        Australia has taken a number of steps to help ensure that women are equitably represented in the upper echelons of the UN. At the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly we were closely involved in the drafting and adoption of resolutions which, among other things, urged the Secretary General by 1995 to increase to 35 per cent the number of women in senior policy and decision-making posts, to increase the number of women at senior levels, to identify the main obstacles to improvement in the status of women in the Secretariat, and to propose ways of overcoming those obstacles.

        We co-sponsored a similar resolution at the UN Commission on the Status of Women in March 1991 and will continue to give high priority to improving the status of women in the UN during the forthcoming session of the General Assembly. We would welcome the applications of suitably qualified Australian women for senior positions in the UN and we will, of course, continue to regularly review the participation rate of women in UN bodies.

        It would also perhaps end some of the quite silly and erroneous comments that I have read or heard today about superannuation, one of which was from the Small Business Association by Mr Peter Boyle on ABC radio this morning, which did not acknowledge that the national wage case in June 1986 found that there were at least grounds for a 3 per cent wage increase but ordered that that wage increase which it found was the entitlement of Australian workers not be taken as wages but as superannuation. If the Commission had not found that back then, wages being paid to ordinary Australian workers now would be of the order of 3 per cent greater, but what the Commission decided was to require that a wage increase be deferred and taken as superannuation. Mr Boyle is wrong in assuming that because many of his members may not pay the 3 per cent superannuation-although some of them are bound by awards to do so-it is in fact not an add-on required of employers out of their own pocket; it is a deferred wage increase which the Commission found as an entitlement for ordinary Australian workers.

         â€”Honourable senators will recall that in the last Budget there was an increase from $11 to $15, which came into effect in November of last year and was part of a major series of reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The maximum general patient contribution rate for drugs listed on the scheme went up from $15 to $15.70 on 1 August 1991. That was part of the package from last year, when a CPI adjustment was foreshadowed in the Budget announcements. Those reforms were introduced to try at least to apply a brake to the massive increases that had been occurring in the costs of operating the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Approximately 70 per cent of prescription medicines purchased in community pharmacies are subsidised through that scheme. In 1989-90 that meant a cost to the Government-and that, of course, means the taxpayer-of $1.2 billion. In terms of the assurance that Senator Foreman is seeking, the safety net is not affected by the increase in the maximum patient contribution rate, and patients should continue to use their 1991 prescription record form to record their purchases of medicines listed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The safety net, of course, is $350.
       </para>
       <para>
        Information notifying patients of the increase has been forwarded to all community pharmacies in the form of a poster and pamphlets. Non-pharmaceutical benefits scheme drugs are not affected by this increase, and as far as the pensioners are concerned the $2.50 charge is unaffected by the 1 August indexation figure that I referred to previously.

So consideration of any extension of this should be seen in the context not only of providing equitable retirement income for all workers, but also in the context of continuing wage restraint, which is of the essence in terms of the management of the economy as a whole and in terms of the likely outcomes that business needs and wants.

A recent staffing review concluded that the position occupied by Mr Remess could be used more productively by appointing a person who could become involved in the production process as well. The position was subsequently classified as `Journalist-Presenter' and advertised in the press. Mr Remess was an unsuccessful candidate for the position. To address Senator Bell's question about the criteria, these included: a sound education, preferably at tertiary level; an excellent speaking voice and strong presentation skills; a self-starter with experience in television reporting, production and presenting; the ability to write links and news updates and compile field reports; the ability to interview talent and edit selected story material; the ability to work under pressure and to tight deadlines in a team environment, and a sound knowledge of local, inter-state and international news and current affairs.

In that particular context, there is further good news in the national accounts figures about the future of the current account because of the information I relayed to Senator Vanstone yesterday-she obviously was not listening-about the growth in net exports and of export activity.

         â€”The revelation that the South African Government has been engaged in secret funding of Inkatha, despite assurances to the contrary volunteered to me during my recent visit, has had a serious effect on the trustworthiness and the credibility of the South African Government in the eyes of most South Africans. It has also dealt a very considerable blow to the credibility of Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, not to mention the handful of very vocal conservatives opposite who have consistently failed to assess the Inkatha movement in anything but ideological terms.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        These latest revelations, although they are obviously unwelcome, come as no surprise to informed observers and confirm the evidence that, regrettably, Inkatha has been compromised by its association with the Government it purports to oppose.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also of interest in the recent revelations is the admission by Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, that some $50m worth of assistance was provided to anti-SWAPO parties during the so-called free and fair elections in Namibia in 1990, which the South African Government was itself responsible for administering. This was at a time when, it will be remembered, the South African authorities were actually threatening to veto the involvement of Australian peace-keeping troops because of doubts concerning their partiality.
       </para>
       <para>
        As serious as all these allegations about secret funding are in themselves, an even more urgent concern is the implications they hold for the persistent body of allegations and evidence that some elements of the police force have themselves been playing an active role in fomenting violence against the anti-apartheid movement, in collusion with Inkatha.
       </para>
       <para>
        President de Klerk has, of course, moved in the last couple of weeks to try to diffuse the situation. Although denying personal knowledge of the payments, he has demoted his two chief security Ministers. He has also promised a partial review of the covert operations of the security forces and he has said that no further funding would be provided to political parties. On violence, he reiterated assurances that the security forces were not involved and promised that all allegations would be referred to a commission for investigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the ANC has rejected these moves as inadequate in various ways, I think importantly, and to its credit, the ANC has nonetheless indicated a willingness to proceed with all-party negotiations, including with both the South African Government and Inkatha. It now appears that the first subject for discussion at those negotiations will be the need for some form of interim government to impartially manage the transition process. And I note in that respect that there have been some encouraging things said by President de Klerk in acknowledgment that the South African Government cannot be both referee and player in that process.
       </para>
       <para>
        On balance, it is my view, and I believe the Government's view, that this funding scandal-and that is entirely an appropriate word for it-may end up actually doing a little more good than harm to the reform process in so far as it may contribute to levelling the playing field as between the major players.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a situation where the South African Cabinet has been recast in a more reformist mould, with the demotion of Ministers Vlock and Malan. It does create a situation which will obviously reduce the capacity of Inkatha to play a disruptive role in the future, should it be minded to do so. It creates a situation where the security forces are under very much closer rein and scrutiny than they have been in the past and it has, obviously, dealt something of a blow to the Government's confidence, which I think is no bad thing in terms of bringing it to the conference table in a slightly more measured and balanced way in the future than it has been so far. If it forces the Government to refocus its attention on finally fulfilling its commitments about political prisoners, exiles and so on, again, it will have been no bad thing at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that respect, I want to welcome the announcement last night that the Government, the ANC and Inkatha have agreed on the question of violence on a five-point peace accord to be signed at a major conference scheduled to be held on 14 September. That peace accord flows from the successful church and business sponsored peace conference process that was under way in June and July. It involves a code of conduct for political parties and the security forces and it obviously represents a very considerable step forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, Australia will continue to play its part in all of this by ensuring that a degree of international pressure is maintained, as appropriate, through all stages of the reform process, while acknowledging at the same time and rewarding, if you like, genuine progress through the phased easing of sanctions. It remains our policy to do just that.

I refer the Minister to the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department of 20 August 1990, relating to sections 51 and 55 of the National Crime Authority Act; the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department of 13 April 1991, relating to section 67 of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act; and the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department of 14 May 1990, relating to section 135a of the National Health Act 1953, all of which have been tabled by me in the Senate. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that each of these opinions relates to the secrecy provisions of the relevant Act and each opinion disagrees or contradicts the other. I therefore ask the Minister: will he undertake to address the confused and contradictory views of the Attorney-General's Department? Will he provide the Senate with the considered and concluded view of this Government as to the relevance of the 300 secrecy provisions contained in the various Acts of the Commonwealth as they impinge upon the powers of the Senate and the committees of the Senate? While the Attorney-General is looking for the answer, perhaps I might remind him of an opinion given in 1985 by the then Attorney-General and the then Solicitor-General, which said--

         â€”I have seen the report and I welcome it. It is certainly an interesting and thoughtful contribution to the current debate. I compliment Professor Fred Hilmer of the University of New South Wales, the professional consulted by the Business Council, for this review. We now have considered views by the Confederation of Australian Industry and the BCA as to the future of the industrial relations system and how it might be structured. There is an important difference in their views: the Confederation of Australian Industry wishes the Industrial Relations Commission to be removed as a compulsory arbitration system and have it accessed by the parties on a strictly voluntary basis; whereas the Business Council of Australia sees real purpose and merit in maintaining the Commission in its present form, although making some alterations to the way in which unions and employers might access it for the purposes of certified agreements or, if you like, collectively bargained agreements.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This is the second in a series of publications by the Business Council; the first was about enterprise bargaining. I am a little disappointed by the title of this publication, the second in the series, which refers to avoiding industrial action. I would have thought that the real issue is how to remove lost time. Industrial action is just one element of removing lost time from industry. The other elements are: time lost through industrial accidents and disease; time lost through high staff turnover, which afflicts many Australian manufacturing companies in particular; and time lost through absenteeism. All these issues ought to be addressed in full.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia we have a particular infatuation with only ever focusing on industrial disputes and not on the other areas of lost time. In some senses it is easier to focus on industrial disputes. In ranked order, it is the least offensive of the lost time elements because it talks about legal frameworks, things outside of the enterprise; whereas absenteeism, high labour turnover, accidents and disease talk about managerial changes and managerial operations within the enterprise. Thus, the blame always gets shifted to the legal framework without people spending sufficient time talking about how managers manage to reduce lost time in a particular enterprise.
       </para>
       <para>
        For that reason I welcome many of the remarks made in this report about improving managerial expertise for a low dispute outcome or reducing lost time. Many of those remarks are very valuable, particularly coming from the Business Council. I certainly do not find offensive in any way the notion that Professor Hilmer articulates that, once an agreement has been reached, there ought to be a peace period for the life of that agreement. That is consistent with many of the things that happen now.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think the report gives sufficient recognition to the fact that section 115 of the Federal Act provides a device now in which those forms of agreement can be taken through the Commission, and it does not require any amendment to the Act to do so. Professor Hilmer is trying to marry collective bargaining with compulsory arbitration. That is very difficult to do because he has tried to provide a version of slightly fettered, not entirely unfettered, collective bargaining and maintained all the penalties and legal devices while saying that this is somehow different from the present system. We are not quite yet at a situation in which industrial law in this country has been perfected to try to deal with the new focus that we are promoting for workplace bargaining.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a useful report. It now makes a significant contribution to the debate. The BCA has recognised that workers `cannot be made to do by compliance arrangements what cannot be achieved through commitment in a well managed business'. That is a significant comment by the Business Council because all too often with this matter we have a debate about improving the sanctions, upping the penalties and magnifying the fines, as if pains and penalties will bring about a better industrial relations outcome. We too infrequently talk about how one manages to develop an enterprise along a teamwork approach so that the penalties are a non-event. This report brings that out and many Opposition members ought to pay particular attention to that because they are the ones infatuated by the pains and penalties route.

        In essence, the Solicitor-General says that whether a particular secrecy provision operates to affect a parliamentary committee's right to information depends upon whether the legislation so provides expressly, or by necessary implication. A general and unqualified-or almost unqualified-prohibition on disclosure is, in his view, insufficient to embrace disclosure to a committee. The Solicitor-General also said that the need for clarifying laws in this respect is obvious in the light of the need for clear guidance in legislation of the rights and duties of parliamentary committees and of officers of the Executive in such cases. The Attorney-General's Department is examining appropriate measures to put the matter beyond doubt.

        The Treasurer has agreed to make available to media organisations outside Canberra two copies of the Budget documents free of charge.

The details of these arrangements will be finalised and announced soon.

        -by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented. Yesterday, Senator Bolkus rose to respond to a personal explanation I made yesterday. I waited until today so I could read in Hansard exactly what he said. Had Senator Bolkus done the same, or asked to borrow my pinks yesterday, he would have seen that the answer he gave was, in fact, referred to in my own statement. I referred to the question asked by Senator Parer and I did not need him to give me the reference.

       I reiterate: my question related to a Labor Party package sent out to Labor Party colleagues which was inadvertently and ineptly sent to Senator Boswell. Senator Bolkus seems to be as slipshod with his answers in this Senate as he is with his mailing. The fact is that I asked a question about that package. There had never been a question asked about that package before. I suggest to Senator Bolkus that he should try to clean up his act a bit and become a little more accurate both in what he says and how he mails.

         Audit Report No. 4 of the Auditor-General is a very serious audit report, not simply because it involves a clear dispute with Comcare but because the matters raised by the Auditor-General are, in many instances, of some substance. In respect of one of the areas of disagreement, I am not quite certain whether it is a matter of almost lese-majeste for the Auditor-General, but it clearly involves the Auditor-General's anger with what seems to be the subject of some double dealing by Comcare, and it seems to be quite appropriate anger. Whether there is greater substance to it than the fact that the Auditor has been improperly dealt with will need another time to determine.
        </para>
        <para>
         Going to the matters of substance, the key findings of the Auditor-General in this Audit Report No. 4 into Comcare are serious indeed. The Australian National Audit Office found that:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . a number of weaknesses in controls over payment operations exposed Comcare to risk of incorrect payment of compensation benefits and to undetected fraudulent claims.
        </para>
        <para>
         The audit concluded:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . improvements were needed in the following areas:
        </para>
        <para>
         -cross-checking of income received by recipients of compensation benefits from other Commonwealth agencies
        </para>
        <para>
         -controls over the payment of medical accounts and the listing of medical providers
        </para>
        <para>
         -review and quality assurance procedures, and
        </para>
        <para>
         -controls over access to the computerised compensation processing system.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor does report that Comcare has taken or is proposing action on the majority of the Audit Office's findings and recommendations. In view of the large amounts of money involved, I hope that very serious attention is given to the comments by the Auditor-General, because the correction of weaknesses in controls over payment operations which expose Comcare to risk of incorrect payments and to undetected fraudulent claims are matters which should be given the highest priority.
        </para>
        <para>
         I hope that perhaps the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) will come back to the Parliament and advise us as to what extent Comcare has corrected its activities. I can assure the Government that this matter will receive a great deal of attention at the upcoming Senate Estimates. As a result, I will not press it here because there are many other matters which honourable senators wish to raise this afternoon.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is a real problem, however, which I would like to raise in the way Comcare appears to have set out to deceive the Auditor-General. That is a serious matter. I do not think the Auditor-General should be put in the position in which Comcare put him. The conclusion of the Auditor-General is:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . the effect of Comcare's presentation of the total set of financial information in its annual report-
        </para>
        <para>
         that is, the 1989-90 annual report-
        </para>
        <para>
         was to make Comcare's financial position unclear and to diminish the value to the Parliament of the Auditor-General's report on the financial statements.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a very serious comment from the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General takes the point that a set of management accounts was included in the annual report of Comcare; that those management accounts were presented before the Auditor-General's audited accounts, which were materially different; and that independent auditors from Price Waterhouse were asked to comment on the unaudited management accounts.
        </para>
        <para>
         The report from Price Waterhouse did point out that these management accounts differ from the audited financial statements by considerable amounts. I will quote them to show how significant they are: a receivable $640.8m, being parliamentary appropriation expected to fund outstanding claims relating to incidents which occurred on or before 30 June 1989, was brought into account in the management accounts; investments were estimated at $154.6m, representing the premium funds deposited into Commonwealth consolidated revenue; and interest accrued on these investments estimated at $11.9m expected to be received in future years through parliamentary appropriations to fund claims incurred on or after 1 July 1989 was also included in the management accounts but by law is not to be included in the audited accounts.
        </para>
        <para>
         Comcare may take the strong view that there was some merit in its outlining, one way or another, these amounts of expected incomes. If so, I have no disagreement with that. But I support the Auditor-General's view that it is misleading to put unaudited financial reports, called management accounts, at the front of the section dealing with the finances of Comcare, ahead of the financial statement audited by the Auditor-General. Naturally, the Auditor-General is fairly cross about this. He says:
        </para>
        <para>
         As part of the responsibilities associated with the audit of financial statements, the external auditor is required to undertake a review of the documents containing the audited financial statements to determine whether other information in these documents is consistent with the audited financial information.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, the auditor should look at all the other elements in the annual report to establish that they relate to the audited statement-he does not just add the figures. The report continues:
        </para>
        <para>
         The ANAO adopts as policy, the requirements of Statement of Auditing Practice No 19-Other Information in Documents containing Audited Financial Statements . . . It is customary for the ANAO to receive from organisations whose financial statements the ANAO audits, a final draft copy of annual reports prior to printing so that the ANAO can comment in terms of AUP19-
        </para>
        <para>
         the information on documents containing audited financial statements, loosely known as AUP19-
        </para>
        <para>
         prior to finalisation of the audit opinion.
        </para>
        <para>
         The report goes on:
        </para>
        <para>
         Due to the protracted nature of the audit of Comcare's 1989-90 financial statements . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         I should interpose that there was a great deal of difficulty and disagreement with the Auditor-General about some of the matters. It took a long time for those audited accounts to be resolved, particularly because of disagreement about the way in which Comcare had dealt with the liabilities of some off-budget agencies. In any event, the audit was of a protracted nature. Because of Comcare's wish to table its annual report early in the autumn session, ANAO said:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . on this occasion the ANAO agreed to provide an audit opinion prior to receiving a final draft copy of the annual report. On a number of occasions prior to issue of the audit opinion (and subsequently) the ANAO had requested a copy of the annual report prior to printing, however, no draft was provided.
        </para>
        <para>
         As I understand it, the ANAO received the printed annual report on 21 February 1991 which was in fact the day that it was tabled in the Parliament. It clearly would have been printed before it was tabled in the Parliament. I notice, looking at the annual report itself, that, quaintly enough, there is no date on the letter from Sandy Halley, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Comcare, which is addressed to Senator the Hon. Peter Cook and which refers to Comcare's second annual report. I think that Comcare should smarten up its act. It should put a date on the letter in the future so that, apart from anything else, we could tell how long the report has been delayed in the Minister's office before it actually makes it to the Senate. We have found that some reports seem to take an awfully long time to get from the Minister's office to the chamber.
        </para>
        <para>
         In any event, there is no doubt that the absence of a date here does not change the fact that the report could not have been printed, delivered to the Minister's office and tabled in the Senate on the same day. Yet it was not until the report was tabled that the Audit Office was given a copy of the remainder of the report, apart from the financial statements which it had audited. That, of course, is in total breach of the understanding and normal forms of behaviour of governmental bodies.
        </para>
        <para>
         At the time that the Audit Office received the printed annual report on 21 February-the day of tabling-it undertook a review of the report in accordance with the requirements of AUP19. It observed that:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . separate management accounts had been included in the annual report preceding the audited statutory financial statements. The management accounts were supported by an expert comment from a partner in a firm of Chartered Accountants. The ANAO is concerned that an expert comment, which can be interpreted as a form of independent reassurance, was included with the management accounts, and that they were located in the annual report in front of the formal financial statements.
        </para>
        <para>
         4.3.5 The ANAO considers that this ordering of the financial reports has the effect of reducing the value to readers of the audited financial statements and the audit opinion thereon.
        </para>
        <para>
         4.3.6 In addition, the management accounts were not annotated sufficiently clearly to indicate that they had not been subject to a formal, independent audit.
        </para>
        <para>
         4.3.7 In the ANAO's view, the overall impact of Comcare's presentation of the financial information in its annual report is to make Comcare's financial position unclear and to diminish the value to the Parliament of the Auditor-General's report.
        </para>
        <para>
         Amen to all of that. I would now like to see Comcare respond to this Parliament about the comments made by the Auditor-General. I think it is up to Comcare to make such a response. If it does not want to make a response to the Parliament, I invite it to make a response to me as I brought the matter up. I think government bodies must be reminded that they have an obligation to the Parliament which, in many instances, is effectively through the Auditor-General because it is the Auditor-General who, in so many instances, draws to our attention the sorts of problems which have appeared in the Comcare annual report.
        </para>
        <para>
         I stress that it is not simply a question of the Auditor-General having his nose put slightly out of joint by receiving the audited accounts after the unaudited financial statement. There are also areas of key problems relating to weaknesses in controls over payment and other matters that I think Comcare should address. I look forward to pursuing this matter in the forthcoming Senate Estimates committee hearings.

          â€”Senator Baume said that much of the material involved in this matter will be taken up at Senate Estimates. I want to deal with the way in which claims are sometimes treated. Comcare is a great scheme. Its intent is to protect people whose income would otherwise be rendered nil because of injuries they have received in the course of their work. It protects everybody who works for the Commonwealth. In fact, it goes further than that. It protects people who work for Telecom, and I will come to that in a minute.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         I say in passing that the proper way of looking after not only people who work for the Commonwealth but also those who work for any employer is, first of all, to ensure that injury does not occur in the first place; that is the humane way of approaching the matter. It saves a lot of anguish and social problems if people are not injured in the first place. As a secondary consideration, it makes the whole thing cheaper in any event because money does not have to be paid out. Unfortunately, people do get injured and they must be compensated.
        </para>
        <para>
         As I say, the scheme is a good one. It is appropriate-and this was the thrust of Senator Baume's address-that the scheme be conducted properly. I have had some representations made to me about the way in which it is administered at times, particularly by Telecom. Telecom is, in effect, a self-insurer in this area. I have been told, and have had it confirmed by a lawyer who acted for the source of the information, that at times Telecom refuses to pay entitlements and demands that a person injured in its employ supply information to it to which it is not entitled before it will do so. I will give one illustration of that point and finish. Apparently, the case I refer to is typical of many.
        </para>
        <para>
         A person was injured while working for Telecom and Telecom admitted liability for that injury, which meant it had to pay. In fact, it did pay. After some time, Telecom asked the person, whose claim it had accepted, for his and his wife's income tax returns, not for any period from the time of the injury onwards but for the time before. It was quite a wrong request, particularly in respect of the man's wife, and it went against the general thrust of what we have legislated for in terms of privacy. It was pointed out to Telecom that it was quite wrong, but this made absolutely no difference. Telecom kept insisting on the returns and delayed this person's payment for some months. In my view, that was quite outrageous, given the fact that people who are injured not only have to bear the physical and mental pain that that brings but also the anxiety of not knowing where their money is to come from.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is incumbent upon a company such as Telecom, whose shareholders are the taxpayers of Australia, to conduct itself properly, to pay out when it should, to not infringe people's privacy and subject them to social and economic stress, and to do what the Act provides. It is wrong to refuse to pay and make people go unnecessarily to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and perhaps further to vindicate their claims. This only adds to their anxiety. After all, this scheme, like many others that have been set up, is to protect workers who give their all for employers. It is incumbent on employers in that situation to make sure that people who are injured in their employ are treated properly. When that does not happen, particularly in a company such as Telecom, it is a matter for comment.

         The latest Auditor-General's report again demonstrates that the Department of Social Security is not the trim, taught and efficient department the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) likes to claim. Let me remind the Senate that last December the Auditor-General found that 20 per cent of telephone rental concession payments were made to people who were not eligible for them. In June, he found that 85 per cent of pensioner valued real estate-excluding the family home-was undervalued and the average undervaluation was $61,224.

         Now the Auditor-General has found that while the family allowance program operates efficiently and effectively for the majority of its beneficiaries, in certain circumstances families can continue receiving assistance for considerable periods after significant increases in their income. Specific observations were made as follows: there is a high margin of error allowed for estimates of income in which a tax assessment for the previous year has not been provided; the conditions prescribing those change of circumstances which must be notified to the Department of Social Security are resulting in beneficiaries with similar circumstances being treated differently; and, due to work pressures and current reassessment provisions, some DSS officers are not investigating identified possible overpayments. The Audit Office has recommended that DSS review its current allowable margin for error when unsubstantiated income estimates are made by DSS clients. It also recommended that DSS review its current notification and assessment procedures for the family allowance supplement.
        </para>
        <para>
         In its response to the Auditor-General's recommendations the Department has stated, as it usually does with these reports, that it is tied by legislation and Government policy decisions. We see almost a Wimbledon replay with the ball going backwards and forwards across the court-from the Minister to the Department.
        </para>
        <para>
         As for the telephone rental concession and the pensioner assets test concerns, responsibility for proving the efficiency of this latest program has been thrown back fairly and squarely into the court of the Minister by his Department. Whether or not he will see fit to act is debatable, given his recent claim that `There is not one other way now I can shave money off the social security budget'. That was before the telephone rental concession payments and the other issue about the valuation of properties had come into view.
        </para>
        <para>
         However, in view of this perennial responsibility swapping between the Department and its Minister, it is pertinent to quote from page 4 of this report, where the Auditor-General says:
        </para>
        <para>
         If every procedure which was the object of ministerial or legislative consideration were, by this means, to be regarded no longer as `procedure' but as `Government policy' and thereby put beyond the ambit of the ANAO the action by the Government and the Parliament in establishing an efficiency audit capability could be nullified.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a very sobering comment made by the Auditor-General. I think it is something the Senate ought to consider very seriously.
        </para>
        <para>
         Of course, by far the most productive thing Minister Richardson could do to reduce social security expenditure is to convince his Cabinet colleagues to undertake the necessary economic, taxation and industrial relations reform which this country needs desperately and is crying out for. The figures we saw yesterday are a perfect example of this. Regardless of the way Minister Evans answered questions in Question Time yesterday, I think he has been to the Keating school of grooming and learning how to make good news bad news.

Mr Keating always used to sit up and tell us, `These figures were good; their effervescence is just a bubbling over of the champagne in the glass'. The Minister will have to improve if he is going to do as well as Mr Keating in making bad news good. If the Minister wants to correct the situation and reduce expenditure on social security, then he ought to convince his Cabinet colleagues to look to the reforms that we desperately need in this country before we spiral even further into the mess and down the Argentinean road to the banana republic Mr Keating predicted some time ago. We need to have those reforms and then at least we will be able to address some of these issues without having to concentrate also on dealing with the spiralling increase in the number of people requiring family allowance.

        <para>
         Putting aside the 700,000 unemployment beneficiaries and their families, the Minister must also recognise that he has a responsibility to get his Department running in the most efficient manner possible, despite the fact that there are so many families currently requiring social security. Whilst I admit that the Auditor-General has stated that the scope for overpayments of fraud in this particular case is small, his latest report is but another addition to the plethora of departmental inefficiencies that have surfaced over the last 12 months, and I referred to two of them earlier.
        </para>
        <para>
         In conclusion, I remind the Senate of a quote from the Minister when he was attempting to stave off the Expenditure Review Committee earlier this year. On ABC radio on 22 March he claimed:
        </para>
        <para>
         There's no question now that after five or six years of systematically going through social security expenditure to make sure that it's properly targeted-
        </para>
        <para>
         and now to an increasing number, as I have just pointed out-
        </para>
        <para>
         that if you want to get any significant savings out of social security you've got to take it out of the pockets of the poor.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is nonsense. Here is another Auditor-General's report telling us exactly the same thing. The way we can increase social security for people is to take them off social security by creating jobs and wealth for them by proper reforms, and also by trimming the Department of Social Security, which is constantly seen in situations where it could do better.
        </para>
        <para>
         This latest report from the Auditor-General shows that the Minister is flying with the fairies-I do not know which fairies; maybe the ones on my left-hand side-if he believes that his Department is the lean, mean fighting machine that he likes to claim it is. This Auditor-General's report demonstrates yet again that some reforms could take place in the Department itself to ensure that the money that is there can be directed and targeted to those who are in genuine need.

        Getting back to the point I was about to make, this Bill, which amends the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, will remove the provision which permits only the cost of road maintenance to be taken into account when determining those registration charges and limits the registration charges that can be imposed on vehicles registered under that system; that is, the federal interstate registration scheme. The amendments will enable the determination, under the FIRS, of registration charges on the basis of full cost recovery, taking into account construction and maintenance costs. Under the principal Act only maintenance could be recovered. Initially this was included on the basis of section 92 of the Constitution. The reinterpretation of section 92 of the Constitution by the High Court of Australia in 1988 means that the construction costs can now be taken into account when setting FIRS charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point I was making before the lunch suspension was that the then Minister for Transport and Communications attended the Yass transport blockade in 1988 and promised the truckies that we would never have full cost recovery, including construction of roads. I suppose that promise was made three years ago and we can excuse Senator Evans, who was the Minister for Transport and Communications at the time, but I thought it would last a bit longer than it did.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, most States already take some construction costs into account in their registration charges. The introduction of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill means that B-doubles will be fully cost-recovered. Charges for other categories under the old system-FIRS-will not change at this time. So charging for B-doubles was not to be considered; however, I believe it was considered at the Special Premiers Conference held in July, but no definite proposition came out of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taking the B-doubles out of the entire charging regime means they will be put on their own. As I said this morning, using B-doubles results in at least a 20 per cent efficiency, but the drivers will pay for that through extra charges. Of course, this adds to the ad hoc system that this Government has, and probably successive governments will have, when charging for road registration and that sort of thing. The industry argues that it already more than covers the cost of the roads it uses since it pays three and a half times as much tax as any other industry. That is according to the Inter-State Commission report on road user charging and vehicle registration. That report recommends that any review of charging should be done in the context of a review of the total tax burden.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the political net gains to the economy of the uniform introduction of B-doubles, it is unreasonable to expect the industry alone to pay the full cost of construction. Lighter vehicles use the roads as well and the transport industry should be charged for only the private benefit it receives from having roads constructed to carry the heavy vehicles; it should not be charged for the full cost recovery of construction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier I mentioned the fact that B-doubles improve the efficiency by 20 per cent. Initially that figure is 40 per cent, but it is brought back down to 20 per cent because the B-doubles, for some reason, are dearer to buy. I believe that is because they are an innovation new to Australia-New Zealand has had them for 15 years and America has probably had them for a lot longer-and so manufacturers tend, and feel entitled, to charge a bit more. Having had a look at the construction of the B-double trailers, I believe that in the short term it will be reduced so that somewhere near the full 40 per cent of extra efficiency will be gained.
       </para>
       <para>
        Returning to road construction, as I said, I believe that not only heavy vehicles should have to carry that burden, but also all other vehicles. If there is anything over to cover the cars and lighter vehicles that are not paying for it, it should belong to the whole community.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I believe that this system of charging uses double standards. For instance, now that we have pulled the B-doubles out of general registration, under the new system the prime mover has to be licensed. That same prime mover can be used, and I am sure it will be used, because if we want to make full use of the system, we cannot always use B-doubles. At present, B-doubles are restricted to certain routes and places. It means that, if that vehicle is to be used anywhere else, there must be a return to the standard procedure of registration when the higher registration fee has already been paid. That is something that I will be bringing up in the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that if there is a special higher charging on B-doubles then any productivity gain-and this legislation was introduced to fix up the problems experienced in Victoria-will not go back to the freight users; it will go back to the Government to prop up the rail system as this Government, and probably other governments, have been doing for some time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to make a few general points relating to the transport situation. Treasury estimates that the transport industry pays $1 billion alone in sales tax. This does not include tax on fuel, stamp duty, company tax, payroll tax and income tax. In a speech to the Transport Association-I cannot place exactly where-the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) admitted that the road transport industry pays 3 1/2 times more tax than other industries. What is more, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) agreed with him, but he has done nothing about it. That means that industries that rely on transport are taxed through the back door.
       </para>
       <para>
        In agriculture alone, 10 per cent of the value of production is consumed in road transport for the average producer in Australia. In the remote areas-such as the area I farm myself-25 per cent of total income from the wheat crop goes on transport. I have had an argument on that matter with the Western Australian Government for at least 10 or 12 years, and over the years we have been able to do something towards lessening that problem. At the extreme end we have been paying $25 to $27 a tonne to shift wheat over a distance of about 400 kilometres, whereas in America, for the same number of dollars per tonne it could be shifted three times further, and be hauled through the Rockies as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition's proposed goods and services tax, which will do away with sales tax, and other measures for improving the tax system will help the road transport industry as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        In winding up, I believe that the road transport system in Australia is certainly over taxed. I believe that this Bill does very little to help that. As I said earlier, I support the idea of bringing in the B-doubles, which is the main part of Bill. We were forced to bring them in-the fact is that Victoria would not play ball. It was recommended by the Inter-State Commission's report on grain handling and storage quite some years ago and very little was done about it. I certainly welcome the Bill, but I do not welcome the charging system. We will be moving some amendments in the committee stage.

         â€”In speaking to the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991, I believe it is fair to say that this is the first major reform in the transport industry. Hopefully, the next ones will come quicker than this one.

       <para>
        I would like to highlight briefly the advantages of using B-doubles and of reform in the road transport industry. My State, Western Australia, has been using larger configurations of trucks for transport for a number of years, with very startling results in efficiency gains and keeping the cost of transport down. I will address the benefits of B-doubles under the Federal interstate registration scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        B-doubles will operate right around the mainland, which will stop some of the wasteful practices which have been occurring on State borders. In fact, it has been brought to my attention that in some instances there have been delays of up to 14 hours for trucks seeking to get across the border into the next State. B-doubles have a pay load of 37 tonnes, which is a significant increase on the conventional 26 tonnes. As outlined by my colleagues, the productivity gains are in the order of 40 per cent but, after allowing for increased capital costs, that comes back to about a 20 per cent efficiency gain. As my colleague Senator Panizza said, as the B-doubles develop, I am quite certain that that efficiency gain will be even greater.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be a number of other benefits. First of all, consumers will benefit, which is very important. Also, particularly in light of the national accounts figures which came out yesterday, our exporters will benefit. The savings in the first year are estimated at about $250m, so that poses this question to the Government: why has it taken six years to introduce the recommendations of the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities? In talking to these two Bills before us, I emphasise that we cannot hang around for another six years before we have further reform in the road transport industry, or the transport industry in general.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there needs to be flexibility with or tolerance of unintended overloading. The best example I can give here is that of loading grain. Because of the nature of the product, there needs to be an estimation made in picking it up initially and there needs to be some understanding and tolerance. These trucks, by their very nature and because of the way they operate, cause less road wear. They are safer; there are fewer trucks on the road; and, because there is a greater pay load, speed is not necessary for the business to survive. I particularly urge the Australian Democrats to support our amendments with regard to making the registration fees consistent with those for other modes of transport.

         â€”Yes, I realise that, but maybe this time they will come to their senses. If we are going to maximise the efficiency gains that are available here, it is very important that charges be consistent. I am greatly concerned with what is happening in the transport industry. Charging procedures being put in place for the road transport industry are being made in such a way that they allow rail to compete with the road transport industry, rather than tackle the inefficiencies which exist within the rail system, making it more efficient so that it can compete.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One can refer to work practices and a whole range of other things, but one point I particularly emphasise is the fuel excise that the rail system pays on diesel. Initially about a third of the excise goes to road funding, and yet we never see too many trains trundling down a road. It has always seemed to me to be an anomaly that the rail system has to pick up some of the cost of road maintenance and road building in this country. The emphasis has to be not on making road transport dearer so that rail can compete, but on getting the inefficiencies out of the rail system so that there is fair competition between the two modes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will touch on a few of the charges to the rail system. These figures have been given to me by the National Transport Federation. I will highlight them. The road transport industry pays 35 per cent more in taxes and charges than the average paid by other industries. The purchase of an articulated unit-prime mover and trailer-and its travel of 250,000 kilometres per year in the first year contribute $84,750 in transport-related taxes and charges, these being as follows. A sales tax on the vehicle at 20 per cent is $37,600. Registration is $4,000. The fuel levy, State and Federal, is $41,900. The sales tax on tyres is 20 per cent, which equals $1,250. The sales tax on commercial vehicles is 17 1/2 per cent higher than the average of that on all goods in Australia. The import duties on commercial vehicles are 17 1/2 per cent higher than those on all goods in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can see from those figures that the road transport industry is put at a significant disadvantage when compared with other industries. If we look at the transport business financial structures, we will find that, of the total cost, fuel comprises 35 per cent, wages 25 per cent, parts and overheads 35 per cent, with a gross profit under the current pricing structure of 5 per cent, making a total of 100 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        All users of fuel pay 24.9 cents per litre. Of that 24.9 cents of the Federal fuel levy, only 5.8 cents per litre is returned to the roads. On those figures, an articulated vehicle travelling 250,000 kilometres a year which uses 140,000 litres of fuel would contribute $40,700, of which only $8,120 would be returned to roads. It is quite nonsensical to say that the road transport industry is not making its contribution in taxation. In fact, there is a very good case for the reform of the taxation system which we intend to introduce after the next election.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that we on this side of the chamber support this Bill. We require it to be amended so that there is consistency in charges for licences. Once again, I strongly urge the Democrats to support our amendment so that we can maximise the potential efficiency gains in this reform.

The main provision of the Interstate Road Transport Bill regulates the maximum road mass and the maximum external limit of each vehicle and allows B-doubles to operate on Federal roads in spite of any State or Territory law to the contrary. However, there is an additional clause which allows the Minister to determine that certain roads are to be deemed Federal routes and, therefore, allow B-doubles to operate on those roads.

        The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had some concerns about these determinations and drew attention to the fact that they may be considered an inappropriate delegation of legislative power.

The Government has already indicated that it will be accepting this amendment, but this is yet another instance-these are all too frequent-of slipshod and hasty drafting by this Government. The coalition is now supporting this Bill with amendments because it is hoped that it will improve efficiency on the roads, reduce costs to consumers and help people who live away from the major capital cities.

        The second reading speech on this Bill makes fascinating reading. The Government is desperately trying to salvage some shreds of respectability in transport reform. It claims that it is actively pursuing a program of reform in land transport complementary to reforms already under way in the coastal shipping, waterfront and aviation sectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the long list of enterprise agreements that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) in Question Time yesterday claimed were being implemented, we await with breathless expectation for real reform on the waterfront with its escalating cost in idle time, a cost which has to be borne by somebody: the user in increased freight rates and ultimately the producer of goods who is trying to keep costs down and to remain competitive. There is no reform until there are reduced costs. The Conaust managing director, Richard Setchell, has said very bluntly:
       </para>
       <para>
        The reform process is only about 10 per cent completed and if the last few weeks of union negotiations on our other enterprise agreements are any indication we will be at it until Christmas-not this Christmas, but Christmas 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        So much for reform on the waterfront! Let us hope that the land transport reforms will be a little more effective, but I doubt it. The second reading speech goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Government recognises the considerable productivity, safety and environmental benefits offered by B-doubles. The introduction of B-doubles on a national basis is therefore an integral part of the Government's reform strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that these vehicles are productive, because they have a payload of 37 tonnes compared with a conventional articulated vehicle with a payload of 26 tonnes. This adds a productivity gain of 40 per cent. Taking the higher capital and running costs into account, the Minister claims an efficiency improvement of 20 per cent and expects that these gains will be passed on to users in terms of lower freight charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister claims that they are safer because they are estimated to have a 25 per cent higher roll-over limit than conventional articulated vehicles. The safety aspect of these vehicles has really not been extensively investigated. The Inter-State Commission makes only a brief reference in its report to safety concerns. Probably the greatest contribution that B-doubles make to safety is their large capacity, which means fewer vehicles are conveying the same load.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the coalition supports the Bill with certain reservations, we will not support the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill. The principal Act permits only road maintenance costs to be taken into account in determining charges for B-double combinations. It limits the charges that can be imposed on vehicles registered under the Federal interstate registration scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is to permit the cost of road construction to be taken into account in determining the level of charges. The Federal interstate registration scheme was first introduced because of difficulties arising from State imposed registration fees on trucks which did not cover the damage caused to roads. In 1954 the Hughes and Vale case relating to section 92 resulted in a High Court ruling that States could not impose taxes on trucks because it would contravene section 92, which provided that commerce and trade between the States would be absolutely free and, therefore, the Federal Government could not levy an impost on interstate trucks.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the court also ruled that States could impose charges on trucks but only as they related to damage to the roads. Hence, the road maintenance tax could be directly linked to the funding of road maintenance works. In 1979 the green dog truck blockade on the Razorback section of the Hume Highway successfully blackmailed the Wran Labor Government in New South Wales into abolishing these charges, and the other States caved in as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth needed some kind of charge imposed on trucks for road damage. As a result, the Federal interstate registration scheme came into being. Under the scheme the Federal charges related only to road damage and were not particularly high. Interstate trucks were free to register under a State scheme or the Federal scheme. Despite the fact that some State charges were very low, the Federal interstate registration scheme was still attractive to some State truck operators because there were no stamp duties and higher load limits were allowed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It must be emphasised that the Federal charges still relate to road damage only. There was still no criterion whereby the Commonwealth could impose full cost recovery for roads which had to be designed and constructed for the use of heavy vehicle traffic.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1988 there was another case relating to section 92-Cole v. Whitfield. The High Court ruled in this case that section 92 had to do with discrimination between interstate and intrastate charges. By extension of these findings, charges could be imposed on interstate vehicles, provided that they were also imposed on intrastate trucks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the 1988 interpretation of section 92, the Commonwealth has been in a position to levy charges to recoup the cost of road construction. Under FIRS the Commonwealth can now charge registration fees to recover the capital cost of road construction as well as road damage costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Federal Government is playing a double game with these Bills. It is not prepared to recoup full cost recovery from all trucks, but it is using B-doubles as an identifiable group of trucks which have been operating for a comparatively short time on our roads. The levy fee on B-doubles will be aimed at full cost recovery. The Government, therefore, has at this time created a distinction between B-doubles and all other trucks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition does not support this Bill for a number of reasons, especially the one raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The Committee noted that the explanatory memorandum to the Bill offered no justification for the removal of the limits on the charge. It also noted that the second reading speech indicates that the purpose of the Bill is to enable registration charges to be determined on a full cost recovery basis. Yet the Government admits that it is full cost recovery for one kind of vehicle only. The charges are not revealed in the legislation, but they will be set by regulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Scrutiny of Bills Committee argued that the charges should be set by primary legislation and be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee suggested that it was inappropriate to set such charges by regulation, particularly in the absence of any limits on the charges which could be set. I quote from the Minister's response to these concerns:
       </para>
       <para>
        Registration of vehicles involved in interstate trade and commerce under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme is an alternative to State registration. To set charges which are far in excess of State registration charges would be counterproductive since operators would merely maintain State registration. Charges set under the Charge Act will be consistent with charges presently being paid by B-doubles operating interstate in eastern Australia. In the circumstances I do not believe that there is a need to set maximum levels of charges for the purposes of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Neither the Committee nor the Opposition is at all satisfied with this response. The argument seems to rely on the level of charges set by the States. The Committee argues that Commonwealth charges set in reference to State charges is an abrogation of power by the Commonwealth Parliament. It is clear that B-doubles are being used as a stooge by the Commonwealth Government to raise money for the deplorable roads in Australia. Over 55 per cent of our major roads have pavements which are at least 20 years old, yet only 2 per cent are being reconstructed each year. We are neither maintaining nor replacing our roads at an adequate rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Poor roads also force up the operating costs of interstate transport and commercial travel costs. It has been estimated that the annual cost per road freight vehicle is increased by up to $40,000 due to the condition of our road system. Conversely, road freight vehicles do add to the cost of our roads. The damage to roads caused by a fully-laden semi-trailer compared with the damage caused by a car is several thousand times greater. That is an argument for imposing charges on trucks for the use of our roads, but not for discriminating against one class of heavy vehicle.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that we need a better road system. Good roads save lives; they reduce fuel consumption; they cut labour and maintenance costs; they improve the basic infrastructure of the nation; and they reduce travelling time. In addition, they stimulate tourism and investment, create jobs and save tax dollars. We have a desperate need for high quality roads linking important Australian ports and terminals and cities. Only then can our exports become more competitive internationally. But this should be done by using more road tax dollars and fuel excises and not by discriminatory road charges. The Opposition does not support this Bill because it is discriminatory and because of the anomaly of setting the charges by regulation with an unknown limit.

         â€”My colleagues have clearly and in some detail explained what the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991 are all about. The Interstate Road Transport Act is amended by the first of these Bills, which provides for registration and regulation of prime movers and trailers. The second Bill amends the same principal Act, allowing charges on B-doubles to include recovery and construction costs as well as maintenance costs. Previously, a provision had existed in the Act which permitted only maintenance costs to be taken into account and which limited registration charges to that. This Bill removes those provisions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As has been mentioned, the coalition supports the first Bill as we recognise that for some time there has been a need to allow B-doubles to operate over mainland Australia. This will improve our efficiency, give consumers a better deal, reduce road damage costs and assist people living in more remote parts of Australia with cheaper transport. I point out, as has been mentioned by my colleagues, that the Government's considerable delay in bringing these decisions to fruition has cost the nation approximately $1 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of us have known of the benefits of B-double trucks for a considerable time. Their payload of 37 tonnes compares favourably with that of conventional articulated vehicles and, in fact, gives a productivity gain of about 40 per cent. If one takes into account the additional capital costs, the operational efficiency improvements are in the order of 20 per cent and, of course, cheaper transport means cheaper goods prices to consumers. Also, the damage to the roads is less. The safety record of these particular vehicles, which has been mentioned at length by my colleagues, indicates that they will help to make our roads much safer. Freight is finite and because we are using bigger payloads there will be fewer trucks on the road.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Kernot made a comment which I could not quite understand. She was saying that we should be legislating to get vehicles off the road because it would then reduce emissions that interfere with the ozone layer, but Senator Kernot then went on to say that she opposed this Bill. This Bill, by increasing the payload that can be drawn by a single prime mover, is one step in the direction of having less motor vehicles emitting gases that can harm our environment. Senator Kernot and the Democrats in their typical fashion seem to have overlooked that.

        When talking about safety, I am concerned that those trucks do take a little longer to pass. If one is driving on these privileged roads around Canberra, between Sydney and Melbourne or even between Sydney and Brisbane, one is able to find passing lanes-and quite often double lanes-where one can pass these huge vehicles but, if one drives on the roads where I drive, in north Queensland, these vehicles create some problems. It is very difficult to pass even a Laser, let alone a double-articulated vehicle such as these are. The Government owes it to those Australians living in the more remote areas to make the roads safer so that these trucks and every other vehicle using the roadways can expect some of the safety that is available to those who, as I say, drive on these privileged roads around Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of the second Bill, we will be moving an amendment which will ensure that the Government does not proceed with the provision to charge B-doubles differently from other vehicles. In the light of the 1988 High Court decision, this provision effectively determined registration costs taking into account road construction as well as maintenance. The legislation allows for this to be incorporated into the charging regimes for B-doubles but not for other vehicles. We believe that this is inappropriate, given that it will only act as a disincentive for operators contemplating the use of B-doubles.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in a sense, this legislation becomes irrelevant in the light of the decision of the Special Premiers Conference to get rid of the FIR scheme, or encompass it in the national heavy vehicle scheme. In spite of that, the Government has brought this legislation in to ensure a swift introduction to the national use of B-doubles and the coalition, of course, supports this move. As I understand it, the legislation was brought in mainly to overcome the difficulties being experienced in Victoria, where the Victorian ALP Government was too gutless to take the action which needed to be taken in that State to allow B-doubles simply because it did not want to offend its mates in the railway unions. To overcome that, we have had to bring in this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concerns we have about the different charging arrangements are strengthened by the decision announced at the Premiers Conference under which B-doubles are again excluded from the timetable of a nationally consistent scheme. We do want to know from the Premiers Conference when these charges will be coming in, and that is what our amendment seeks to rectify. We see no reason why there needs to be any disparity between the registration charge regime for B-doubles and that for any other heavy vehicles. It seems quite ludicrous that the Government wants to propose a situation where charges paid by the B-double operators are higher than those paid by their competitors who are using smaller articulated and other trucks.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is consistent with the Government's other actions in relation to road user charges which continually cause anxiety, particularly in provincial and rural Australia. These anxieties were only heightened by the recent Special Premiers Conference. All that the operators in rural and provincial Queensland know is that they face large registration charges increases to an extent to which no-one seems able to give a straight answer. They know that Mr Goss signed the intergovernmental agreement establishing the national heavy vehicle registration scheme only after Queensland was put in a so-called low cost zone with Western Australia and South Australia. Yet Mr Goss can shed no light whatsoever on what difference operators in Queensland will experience in comparison with their counterparts in southern States. He can give no indication whatsoever, except to say that the charges in Queensland will be lower.
       </para>
       <para>
        Transport industry sources have said that the increases being contemplated amount to about a 400 per cent increase in registration charges and that States, such as Queensland, in the low cost zone can expect a charges increase of 5 per cent less than that. That is of great benefit to those of us in Queensland-instead of having the 400 per cent increase we now only have a 395 per cent increase! I hope for the sake of Queensland that those rumours are not true, and I hope that Mr Goss can assure transport operators that this is not the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also hope that he is be able to spell out what he expects the level of charges increase to be, and what level he is willing to accept. In all the post mortems of the Premiers Conference, all that Mr Goss has been willing to say-or, perhaps, is even capable of saying-is that he has won a major concession for Queensland truckies. His rhetoric is not backed up by any indication on his part as to what he believes the charges increases will be and what he is prepared to accept. He can give no indication whatsoever.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Goss has tried to allay fears by saying that he will veto any increases in charges which are too extreme and which will hurt country areas in Queensland. But the onus is really on Mr Goss to come clean with Queensland's road transport industry and spell out publicly just what sort of registration charges increases he is willing to wear before he uses his veto power. Transport operators have been left completely in the dark. They are very concerned, to put it mildly, and they would like some answers.
       </para>
       <para>
        What Queensland operators do know, however, is that the Northern Territory Government refused to sign the agreement on the grounds that it would not be party to charges increases under consideration. So we might well ask: why did Mr Goss sign? Mr Goss is quoted in the following article from the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin:
       </para>
       <para>
        the planned national system would mean heavy registration charges, spelling increased costs for rural areas . . . ``While the idea of a national heavy vehicle system is fine in terms of rational economic theory, it will have a very bad effect on rural industry through increased costs, and will also make the general cost of living in rural and provincial Queensland more expensive''.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what Mr Goss said. He is quoted as saying that, yet he still goes along and signs the agreement without any guarantee of what will happen. As Senator Chapman said earlier, Mr Goss has estimated that the increase in cost of living for Queenslanders could be anywhere between one per cent and 4 per cent. That is not good enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Northern Territory Government got around this by agreeing to mirror all the non-charging aspects of the regulations implemented under the new scheme to achieve uniform regulations throughout Australia. Mr Goss has agreed to a system which comprises a nominal administration charge, a road use component of the Commonwealth diesel excise and a registration charge for vehicles which do not meet their road costs through fuel payments alone. Mr Goss should have taken the system's impact on regional Queensland into account before he signed the agreement. He obviously did not, whereas the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory was unwilling to sign until that impact was considered. The coalition has called consistently for an economic study into the impact of the proposed system on provincial and rural Australia, a call which equally as consistently has been ignored by the Government-but it does need to be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        The invitation-only token talkfest thrown by Mr Snowdon, the ALP member for the Northern Territory, at the Alice Springs Sheraton last year, to which almost exclusively Canberra bureaucrats and Labor politicians were invited-it cost over $500 a head to get there-is no substitute for the detailed research which still needs to be done. In principle, the coalition supports the concept that road pricing should be done on a more rational basis; however, we do not think this Bill is fair.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the last year I have travelled extensively throughout north Queensland and have participated in numerous public meetings with transport operators, all of whom have been very concerned about what these charges might bring. Not surprisingly, while the shadow Minister for land transport, Mr David Hawker, has come to listen to their concerns, the Government Minister has refused to front the crowds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Labor Party members have plenty of time to swan around in the Sheraton Hotel in Alice Springs at their pricey and exclusive talkfest, chatting amongst themselves and with their bureaucrats, but they do not seem to have any time to get out and talk to the transport operators on the ground and listen to their concerns. Unless the Government can face up to the responsibilities and assess the damage that the new system might cause to people living in remote areas, it should shelve this part of the legislation at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, it seems that the new charging system disadvantages individual and smaller transport operators, in comparison to the major transport companies which might be in a better position to absorb and survive registration and excise hikes. The more cynical of us might surmise about conspiracy theories and wonder whether Bob Hawke's mate and confidante at secret ALP leadership meetings gives him any special advantage when he wears his other hat as boss of one of Australia's transport giants.
       </para>
       <para>
        A very common concern which is expressed to me often by operators is that they may be intentionally squeezed out of the system, leaving only the very large road freight companies, which will be able to accommodate the charge increase because of the smaller amount of competition once the small players are gone. If this does occur, the remaining carriers will be under less pressure to keep their prices down.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, and now the Democrats, says that trucks do not pay enough, but there is a body of evidence which shows that a typical owner-driver pays 33 per cent of his revenue in one form of tax or another.

If all the money that they paid were directed to roads-remembering the billions of dollars that are paid out in road transport all around Australia-we would not have to worry about our roads at all; they would be beautiful highways and we probably would be able to let motor vehicles on the roads without any registration.

        Despite all the hyperbole of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Mr Goss, it is interesting that in his industry statement earlier this year road transport was the only input to manufacturing that was denied special sales tax treatment. All the sales tax on road transport has remained, which is something that will not happen, I add, under the coalition's plan to abolish the wholesale sales tax completely, to cut income tax and to exempt all business inputs from that tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is said that the road transport system does not pay its way, but it most certainly does. That point has never been understood by the Government and it is certainly not understood by the Democrats. The Democrats are announcing in their alternative Budget that they will collect an extra 1c per tonne per kilometre from all domestic road freight movements in Australia. They estimate that they will collect $855m in a year. If one does the arithmetic, that is an extra $50 in road freight tax from every man, woman and child in Australia. That is what the Democrats propose; that is what they think about people who live in remote Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can understand why Senator Kernot, who lives right in the centre of Brisbane, does not care two hoots about that sort of thing because one does not have to spend much in road freight when one lives in the centre of Brisbane. But if a person lives in the bush or in the more remote areas of Australia then the sorts of policies which the Democrats are proposing are an absolute anathema.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has no place adding more taxes to reduce the competitive position in road transport. The Government should be using more of its existing fuel taxes on roads. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that before the last election the coalition promised to use an extra 2c per litre from the existing fuel taxes to fund the much needed improvements to our roads around Australia. What did the Government do? In real terms, the amount of money that has gone from fuel taxes back into roads has dropped by some 27 per cent under this Government, while the money collected from the fuel tax has gone up by some 90 per cent. So much for the Government showing its concern for roads and road funding.

        Up my way we have a Labor member for the electorate of Herbert-for a little while anyhow. He is constantly arguing with his State Labor colleagues about who is at fault for the shocking state of the roads around Townsville and Cairns. He keeps getting publicity in the newspaper by telling the State Labor Government that it is not doing enough. Of course, the State Labor Government comes back and blames the Federal Government. So while we all rattle around on atrocious and very unsafe roads in north Queensland, we have the Labor Party in its State and Federal capacities at each other's throats blaming each other. It would be helpful if the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the State members who represent the north Queensland electorates got together and demanded a bit more of Queensland's share of the funds for the roads that do need repair and attention in north Queensland.

        As I have mentioned, we welcome the Government's long overdue decision on B-doubles. We hope that the Government will do all that it can to ensure that the efficiency gains which this mode of transport offers are not hindered in any way. We support this part of the legislation, even though it has taken six years to come into this place. The Government should have acted long ago to ensure this major improvement to micro-economic reform, particularly in the land transport area. It is unfortunate that at the same time as it brings in this good legislation to allow for B-doubles, the Government then also wants to charge the hell out of these new trucks and rip more money in taxes from them. It is for this reason that we are not prepared to support the charging aspects of these Bills and our amendment addresses that discrepancy.

         â€”The Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991 which are before the chamber today are quite important because they create a framework in which B-doubles can be registered under the Federal interstate registration scheme. But there is a sting; because while the Government says, `You can register B-doubles', what it does with the other Bill is say, `We are going to impose a higher and discriminatory registration charge on B-doubles'. Of course, the only reason why a transport operator-be he a little transport operator or a big transport operator-will go to the greater cost of investing in a B-double is that he believes he will get greater efficiency out of it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It has been shown that B-doubles give something like 20 per cent greater efficiency than ordinary articulated vehicles. But the problem is that, under this Government and under the two Bills that it has introduced in the Parliament today, the benefits of that greater efficiency do not go to the truckie, who has forked out of his own pocket to invest in more expensive equipment; instead, the benefits of the greater efficiency go to the Government. The Government is putting B-doubles on the road but taxing them off the road at the same time. Whilst we support and are fully behind the proposal for B-doubles to get Federal interstate road registration, we are totally opposed to the idea that this Federal Government should discriminate against those transport operators who wish to improve the efficiency of this nation's transport network.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, this all comes under the framework of what the Australian Labor Party calls micro-economic reform. But where is the reform if, instead of reducing the cost of road transport and the input costs of road transport operators, those costs are merely made higher? There is no reform at all. It is a sham and it is a sham that will cause truckies and the people who put their freight on the roads to pay dearly. That is why we on this side of the chamber will not support the proposal by the Federal Government to put a higher registration charge on B-doubles than it puts on any other articulated vehicle on the roads. We say that that is wrong and is taking the benefits away from the truckie who deserves them and putting them in the coffers of the Federal Government in Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that these Bills should come before the chamber at a time when Senator Gareth Evans is the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, because on 14 July 1988, when Senator Evans was the Minister for Transport and Communications, he issued a press release after the Yass blockade. Paragraph 5 of that press release says:
       </para>
       <para>
        the Government will retain the principles included in the existing legislation that the Federal registration charges are determined on the basis of road damage and that the practice of including limits on the level of charges in the legislation will be continued.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two promises in one paragraph have been broken by these Bills that have been introduced into the Senate. We say that that is thoroughly unacceptable. It happens to B-doubles today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Goodness help the Australian transport industry if Senator Evans ever becomes the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He has been Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate this week and already the Government has attacked B-doubles. Goodness help us if he ever becomes leader, because every truckie in this country will fall under the same high taxing regime that is shown in the second Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the bottom line on all these proposals is really quite simple: this Federal Government is busy taxing the life out of small business.

        This Federal Government will tax the life out of small business. Truckies are a perfect example of the most efficient sector of small business in this country. In the last 20 or 30 years, road transport charges have risen nowhere near the rate of increase in cost for the equipment that truckies use, yet truckies still manage, through the dead of night, to get the produce to the cities and get the goods from the cities to the towns. That is why I say that truckies are some of the hardest working people in this country. Unfortunately, the poor owner operator does not now get the profits of his labour; this is because of all the taxes that a truckie pays. Let us list them: sales tax of 20 per cent, fuel tax, provisional tax, registration charges and, if he is lucky enough to make a profit, income tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we put all those taxes to one side of the equation and put the small bit of money that he takes home to his wife and kids at the end of the week to the other side, everybody can see who gets the majority of the profits of the road transport operator-it is not the road transport operator but the Federal Government, the people sitting on the other side of the chamber. We find that wholly unacceptable and inequitable.

        Minister Bolkus challenged me to talk about the goods and services tax. I am glad he did. It was only about a month ago that I heard the Labor Party's State Treasurer in Queensland saying on ABC radio that this goods and services tax would be absolutely terrible because it would introduce a 15 per cent tax on road transport. But like his Federal colleagues, he did not have the honesty and integrity to say that they are already imposing a 20 per cent sales tax on road transport--

He did not say that the coalition's proposal for a goods and services tax will free small and large business-every business in this country-for the first time ever from this evil government tax on their input costs. The State Labor Party Treasurer in Queensland did not have the honesty or the integrity to tell the people listening to that program that not only is there a 20 per cent tax on the transport but also there is a 20 per cent tax on the input costs of those truckies. For many small operators, that 20 per cent tax means the difference between survival and going under.

        I am very proud to talk about the goods and services tax and our proposal to abolish the wholesale sales tax lock stock and barrel. This Government does not have the honesty to do it; it does not have the honesty to talk about what it is doing to the road transport operators; and it does not have the courage or commitment to real reform to bring about a reduction in cost for businesses in this country. We in the National Party are right behind road transport operators all the way because we recognise the important contribution that they make to maintaining the living standards of people in country areas.

       <para>
        To anybody who wishes to examine this debate more carefully, I can only commend to them the speech given earlier today by Senator Tambling, the Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Senate, who hit it on the head when he said that these proposals, which are the forerunner of the federal interstate road registration scheme that was proposed at the Special Premiers Conference, are a complete volte-face from all the fine rhetoric that we heard from the Labor Party in Alice Springs and from what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in his so-called famous speech of 1989. They are a complete volte-face from everything that Senator Evans spoke about in 1988. They show that the people who sit on the other side of the chamber cannot be trusted to look after small business, cannot be trusted to look after the road transport operator and cannot be trusted with the future of this nation.

       (5) All NMLS and MMG staff are employed in accordance with Section 13(1) of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984, which is administered by the Department of Administrative Services. They report to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.
      </para>

       (7) The duties of the Townsville-based NMLS staff are the same as those for all NMLS staff, as detailed in the answer to (2).
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Neither NMLS or MMG staff provide a systematic clipping and media coverage service along the lines of services provided by commercial agencies. However, clippings are sometimes made in the course of coordinating the provision of accurate and timely information on Government policies and programs. Copies of such material can be made available to Members and Senators upon request, where ministerial obligations have been met, the material has been retained, and is known to be not readily available from other sources.
      </para>
      <para>
       Note: (i) In relation to the answer to part (3), the figures shown for both bodies from 1983/84 - 1987/88 relate only to total salary expenditure. Department of Administrative Services (DAS) accounting systems prior to 1 July 1988, included aggregate costs for NMLS and MMG with other categories of expenditure.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Following Administrative Arrangements Order amendments of 6 February 1989, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories assumed responsibility for administrative costs of the NMLS and MMG. DAS continues to pay salaries and allowances of NMLS and MMG staff as they are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984, which it administers.

      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The New South Wales (NSW) Minister for Forests, Mr West, has stated that logging will not be carried out on Crown Land including state forests which has been identified as koala habitat, including areas within the research zones, until further investigations have determined the base range of the animals in that vicinity. Logging which is carried out on private land is generally carried out by private sawmillers and is not subject to State Government regulation unless the area is within a protected zone for soil and water conservation requirements. There have been reports of logging on private land in the vicinity of Mt Darragh.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Any review of the Harris-Daishowa export licence is a matter for the Minister for Resources. Neither the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 nor the Administrative Procedures under the Act provide the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories with any power to have logging in the south east forests (or elsewhere) stopped. The Administrative Procedures, however, provide for a review and assessment of the environmental aspects, including in particular the effectiveness of any safeguards or standards adopted or applied for the protection of the environment, of a proposed action which has previously been the subject of action under the Act. The export of woodchips by Harris- Daishowa for the period 1990-2010, including chips sourced from the south east forests, was the subject of an assessment under the Act during 1986-1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been considerable correspondence on this issue between myself and Mr West in order to determine the actions of the New South Wales management agencies in light of the growing evidence that the south east forests are koala habitat. I have recently written to Mr West again to satisfy myself that all necessary measures will be and are being undertaken to protect the koala habitat in this forest. The information obtained from this correspondence will allow me to properly consider the need for a review under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The koala management plan for the south east forests of NSW is a joint initiative of the NSW Forestry Commission and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. I have also again raised with Mr West what effect the sighting of koalas and the required management will have on the proposed boundaries for the National Parks agreed to as part of the Agreement on the south east forests between the NSW and Commonwealth Governments last year.

       (b) Advised on 27 June 1991. In my answer on 6 March 1991 to question No. 302 from Senator Durack, I indicated that of two export permits given in relation to Burma one had been exported in 1990-91 and the other had not been exported at the time of my reply. This advice was based on departmental records including correspondence with the exporter up to that time. In the light of the present question and further investigation the company has advised that the second export of engine parts was actually made in August 1989 soon after the permit was issued as indicated in the dates above.

       (c) As the engine parts were not lethal nor deemed not to be of major military significance referral to the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports (SIDCDE), which includes a representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was not required. This was in line with the procedures in operation at that time. As indicated in my Statement of 30 May 1991 members of the SIDCDE will be consulted even if the applications to export to sensitive destinations do not relate to goods that are lethal or of major military significance.

      <para>
       (1) When the Government nominated the Wet Tropics of north Queensland for World Heritage Listing, what, if any, provisions were made to compensate those adversely affected by the listing but not directly involved in the timber industry.

       (2) Stannum Pty Ltd was not mining or processing tin at China Camp in December 1987, the date of nomination of the Wet Tropics of Queensland for World Heritage listing or in December 1988, the date of listing of the area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. However, the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, did write to the Directors of Stannum Pty Ltd on 9 March 1989 regarding the China Camp area in the following terms:
      </para>
      <para>
       `The Government has provided a $75m Structural Adjustment Package to assist workers and businesses affected by the cessation of logging. Your case therefore does not meet the guidelines for compensation under that package.

       I am prepared to give your case for compensation further consideration. However I would prefer to consider revised proposals from you, either for mining of the leases by low impact methods or for other environmentally acceptable uses of the land . . .'

      <para>
       (4) and (5) The then Minister's Department informally advised the Chairman of the Interim Management Authority in December 1989 that Stannum Pty Ltd's mining and compensation proposals would be referred to the Authority for advice. However, before this matter was formally referred, negotiations commenced with the Queensland Government on establishing new joint Commonwealth/State management arrangements.

Following a detailed examination of company records in Perth and an inspection of the China Camp site, Price Waterhouse advised that the basis of the claim was inappropriate.

       (7) and (8) Between March 1989 and April 1990 a number of letters was exchanged between the Commonwealth, Cultus Gold N.L.

       (1) and (2) It is a condition of grants to the States under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 that the States ensure that institutions do not charge any student fees except as provided by s.13. S.3 of the Act defines `fees' for this purpose. The Minister may issue a notification under paragraph (g) of s.3 of the Act in cases where a specific charge falls within that definition of fees.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of charges that are not fees as defined, the question of notification does not arise. Charges for materials or services which are not compulsory to undertaking a course are not `fees' under the Act, nor are charges in the nature of a fine or penalty. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has written to institutions to inform them of the principles that determine whether or not particular charges might constitute `fees' under the Act.

       (1) The sponsor company, Organon, has failed to satisfy Australian Drug Evaluation Committee's (ADEC) concerns over the quality, safety and efficacy of the product Marvelon.

      <para>
       (3) The exact reasons for rejection would be considered commercially confidential by the sponsor company. They relate to inadequate evidence of the rate and extent of absorption of active ingredients and inadequate animal toxicity studies. No clinical evidence for a comparative advantage for the use of Marvelon over currently available products was available, but there was some evidence of increased problems with cycle control in women using Marvelon. There was insufficient clinical benefit to outweigh other defects.

        â€”-The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Yes. The proclamation of 21 June 1991 incorporated the former Kakadu Conservation Zone, into Kakadu National Park, effectively enlarging the Park by an area of 47.5 km(2).
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The Plan of Management for Kakadu National Park, made available for public comment in June 1991, is essentially a draft plan which may be amended in the light of the public comments received. Given the number of public representations received and the incorporation of the former Kakadu Conservation Zone into the Park since the Plan was prepared, the Plan will be amended before being submitted to the Minister and the Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) As mentioned in (a) above, the Plan of Management made available for public comment in June 1991 will apply to the enlarged Kakadu National Park. Subsection 11(5) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 provides that a Plan of Management may include provisions for an area that is proposed to be added to a park or reserve.
      </para>
      <para>
       Without pre-empting any Government decision on the future of the Conservation Zone, the Plan made available for public comment took into account the possible addition of the 47.5 square kilometre Conservation Zone to the Park and included some provisions for its management. The incorporation of the Conservation Zone into the Park has therefore not required preparation of a new plan or an additional period of public comment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) As noted above, the Plan of Management has been made available for public comment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) See (i) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Not applicable.

        â€”-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Australian expert, Dr Ron Huisken, has been active and influential in the deliberations of the UN Expert Group on Conventional Arms Transfers. In particular, Australia was responsible for an important redraft of the 9th chapter of the Group's report, which contains the conclusions and recommendations of the Group, including the recommendation for the establishment of a UN arms transfer register.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) There have been four meetings of the Expert Group since it was established, pursuant to UN Resolution 44/75 I, in 1988. This resolution requested the Secretary General, with the assistance of government experts to explore ways and means of promoting transparency in the international transfer of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       The conclusions and recommendations of the Group are to be submitted to the General Assembly at its 46th session which will begin on 17 September this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In accordance with its mandate, the Expert Group's recommendations cover only conventional arms transfers; and do not attempt to define specific categories of arms to be included in the register. The Group has recommended to the Secretary General that a second Expert Group be mandated to define the scope and parameters of the equipment that be included in the register.
      </para>
      <para>
       The detail of the arrangements for reporting sales and imports also remains to be established. Australia will continue actively to support the early establishment of a working UN register, and we will continue to contribute positively to its development.
