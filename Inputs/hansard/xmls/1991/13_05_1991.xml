         —My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is the Minister aware of the survey released by the Business Council of Australia (BCA) yesterday showing that investment this financial year has fallen for two-thirds of manufacturing respondents and for half of other respondents, and that two-thirds of all respondents expect investment levels to be cut again next financial year? Is he also aware of yesterday's statements by the Council's Executive Director that `unemployment is going to get worse' and that `it is just wishful thinking to believe the recession will be over this year'? Finally, has the Minister seen reports that his colleague Senator Walsh has said that the so-called recession is arguably a depression and that the direct cause of this has been the Government's monetary policy? I ask the Minister: does he agree with the views of the Business Council and Senator Walsh? If so, will he now publicly withdraw his remarks of only last week that the worst is over?

         —Senator Short is pretty good at reading headlines; he should read the contents. If he read the contents, he may be able to ask a supplementary question which is phrased better than his original question. I did not say that the worst is over; I said that in certain sectors of the economy the belief was being expressed to me that the recession had bottomed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In respect of the question as a whole, let me say that I have seen reports in the newspapers of the BCA survey and I have also seen the statements made by the Executive Director of the BCA. I must say that neither result entirely surprises me in the present circumstances. There are very disappointing conclusions, but they do not entirely surprise me. These statements made in the depth of a recession reflect conditions of an economy which is in a severe trough, and as economic conditions improve expectations may also improve. Business surveys about investment often reflect expectations about new investment projects rather than investment in committed projects, and intentions about new projects are more volatile than total investment. Nonetheless, I do not in any way retreat from the fact that overall, irrespective of any Business Council survey, investment intentions are weak.

       <para>
        I turn to the suggestion made by Mr McLaughlin that unemployment will be worse. I think that is a distinct possibility. Anyone who reads what I said in the newspaper article-and Senator Short waved the headline of it-will realise that I said that unemployment was a lagged indicator and the outlook would continue to be poor. In relation to the comment which Senator Short attributed to Senator Walsh, I have not read it although I saw that Senator Walsh used the word `depression' rather than `recession'. I have not read the statement that the recession, or whatever, was induced totally by Government interest rates policy. But if I had read it or if that quote were correct, then I would disagree with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        A wide range of factors impact on the depth of the recession in Australia, apart from government interest rate policies. These include such things as the depth of the rural crisis in this country. Certainly, farmers have had a difficult time with interest rates, but the rural crisis has not been induced by interest rates; it has been induced by markets.

        The NFF fighting fund apparently grew out of the Mudginberri dispute and has been threatened to be used where the NFF has talked about its members going onto the waterfront in Australia. We understand from Troubleshooters Available that the fighting fund was used to help it in a major legal action dealing with the definition of `worker' in the building industry, seeking to have the classification of `worker' redefined as `contractor'. We know that, according to Troubleshooters Available, which is a privately-owned commercial company, it would not have been able to take that legal action without the support of that quite obviously healthy fund of the NFF.

If an appeal has been lodged, no-one can claim victory until the appeal has been determined; I would have thought that was quite obvious. It is clear that there is great hardship in rural Australia. I am not sure that farmers who are members of the NFF would consider that contributions by them to a quite large fighting fund-amounting to maybe $12m-ought to, in the face of that rural crisis, be spent on ascertaining the definition of a `worker' for the benefit of those who build concrete and glass towers in the central business district of Australia. Maybe some farmers think that is the priority in this crisis, but I would be surprised if that was a universal view.
        </para>

       <para>
        The Government is concerned about problems in rural Australia. We have pledged up to $500m to the wool industry and up to $150m to the wheat industry. We have increased the rural adjustment scheme to $160m in 1991-92. We are mounting a huge diplomatic effort in the world to have the trade blocs, the export enhancement scheme in the United States and the common agricultural policy in Europe, done away with.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, those things which open markets for Australian rural products are of a higher priority than this matter, which I consider to be a wrong priority for farmers. I do not know what a family on a farm in Australia which is facing hardship in the economic circumstances of today, because of the operation of those trading blocs in the world, thinks about its money, or money that could be spent in aid of its immediate needs, being spent on esoteric legal actions in the field of industrial relations.

        <para in-line="1">
         —At the start, I rebut totally the allegation by Senator Parer that I improperly intervened in this matter. I repeat for him once again, so that he can understand it, that by my intervention in this matter two things have happened. First of all, we have now a list of eligible tenderers for government which provides items at a cheaper price than were provided on the initial list. So, firstly, in essence, the taxpayer wins out. Secondly, an Australian supplier, which has been able to use the Australian-made logo, has been put back on a tender, together with a number of other companies providing items at a cheaper price than those that have already been accepted on that panel of tenderers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Those two objectives have been realised and I rebut totally the inference that there has been improper intervention. I am responsible for this area and if this sort of situation were to arise again, with those two motivations in mind, I would do the same thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, in the other part of Senator Parer's question, he made some statement about diskettes other than the 5 1/4-inch diskette. My recollection is that that particular diskette in itself came within the range that would otherwise have been included on the tender if a fair process and evaluation had been adopted at the start. So, for a start, that part of Senator Parer's allegation in respect of Nashua Australia Ltd is rebutted by the facts.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of the other allegation, no-one has claimed that the diskettes have been made within Australia. However, I have consistently said that Australian content is involved in Nashua's production and, to that extent, Nashua as a company is entitled to use the `Australian made' logo.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know why Senator Parer keeps on raising this question. He is on a loser and he has been on a loser from day one on it. Let me reiterate that we have advice from senior officers of the Department that the process, in which I took an interest, was one that could and should have been conducted much better and fairer in a whole range of ways. That was quite clearly evidenced by the documents that were tabled in here last week. Those documents and that advice from the Secretary of the Department and senior officers have not been taken into account by Senator Parer because he has an incapacity and a non-desire to actually address the facts in this case.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the outcome of the whole thing is that we now have on the panel a company which is entitled to use the `Australian made' logo. That company, in respect of one of those diskettes for which it is back on the tender, is price competitive. Those two outcomes are evidence that my involvement, the due conduct of my responsibility in this area, was well merited.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me ask a couple of rhetorical questions. The point ought to be made because it does show the difference between the Government side of the Parliament and the Opposition side. The reality is that Opposition senators come in here making accusations and claims but government is about hard work. Government is about actually taking responsibility and an interest in portfolios. So let me ask the rhetorical question: is Senator Parer saying that as a relevant Minister he would not have been persuaded by the fact that an Australian supplier had been unfairly excluded from this tender? Is Senator Parer saying that he would not have been motivated by the fact that companies tendering prices at cheaper than those that were accepted on the tender were excluded? Would Senator Parer not be motivated to take an interest? If that is the case, Mr President, it highlights the distinction. That is why the Australian Labor Party is over here and that is why the Australian people put us here.

After all, the introduction of the fringe benefits tax was the cause of considerable concern at the time and a lot of wimpishness and backfilling by the Opposition-a terrible weakness of the Opposition parties-and, an election or so later, it decided that it was not a bad thing after all. Now, after a similar time span, the United Kingdom Government has decided to introduce a form of fringe benefits tax. It is good, of course, that some of these ideas are starting to penetrate the ranks of conservative parties. I hope that the process goes on-even here in Australia where it is a pretty hopeless task, one would think.

         —Because Senator Crichton-Browne belongs to the old WA Inc.-the one run by Charlie Court-and we have not caught up with that yet. There has been a massive crackdown on rorts. A lot of the hard issues, in terms of fringe benefits, capital gains tax and so on, have been tackled by this Government and the tax base has been broadened considerably. Capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax add to the purchasing power in the same way as ordinary income. The introduction of taxes on fringe benefits and capital gains was made because it was clearly unfair that ordinary wage and salary earners were taxed while others earning an equivalent amount in kind were not. Broadening the tax base has provided the opportunity to reduce personal tax very substantially.

        The report that appeared in most of the print media and elsewhere this morning suggests that Australia had no right to criticise Turkey's human rights record because our prisoners were subjected to torture and repression with some 96 prisoners committing suicide each year due to torture and repression. To the extent that was said-and I repeat that we have no confirmation that it was-it is not an accurate statement about the situation in Australia. The Australian Institute of Criminology late this morning put out a statement making that very clear. It came from Mr David Biles, the Deputy Director of the Institute, who was head of research for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, in the course of which he was responsible for compiling very accurate and comprehensive information not only about Aboriginal deaths but also about all deaths that have occurred in police custody or prisons over the past 10 years. His conclusion from that study was:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . over the past ten years the average number of suicides in prisons throughout Australia was just under 14 cases per year. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these cases were the result of torture or repression.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the general question of the comparison of Australia's human rights record with Turkey's, comparisons of this kind in this context are a little invidious. I do not propose to go into any further detail on that subject except to say that there have been a number of human rights problems in Turkey over the years. They were the subject of some considered and extensive discussion in private between the Prime Minister and the President, in which discussion I and the Turkish Foreign Minister participated. They were the subject of some reference by the Prime Minister during the dinner, as most honourable senators would recall. Those references by the Prime Minister were sufficient to articulate Australian concern, but were moderate and balanced in character.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have also said publicly today, it ought to be acknowledged that the Ozal Government has made considerable strides, particularly in the very recent past, in working some conspicuous improvements in the situation, at least so far as the text of the relevant law is concerned. It may be that practice has some little distance yet to go. As I say, it is not helpful to engage in any further contrasts and comparisons; the points have been made sufficiently clearly.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the last part of the honourable senator's question-will the Government consider stripping Mr Ozal of his OA?-the answer is no. That award was given in specific acknowledgment and recognition of the very substantial role that Turkey played in the commemoration of Gallipoli. It was a gesture of appreciation on behalf of the Government and the people of Australia for the role that Mr Ozal and his Government played in ensuring that the commemoration was the spectacular and moving success that it was.

The five unions were the Australian Bank Employees Union, the Australian Insurance Employees Union, the Trustee Companies Officers Association, the AMP Society Staff Association and the Wool Brokers Staffs Association. All of those now appear destined to form one finance sector union in Australia. It will have a notional membership of 108,000.

       <para>
        We take some pride as a government in laying the legal framework for the possibility of amalgamations of this sort. Our commitment to the idea of union amalgamation arose from five major reports under several governments in the past-the Jackson report on manufacturing industry in 1975, the report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1977, the Myers report on technological change in 1980, the report of the Hancock Committee of Review of Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems in 1985, and the Pappas Carter report for the Australian Manufacturing Council, The Global Challenge: Australian Manufacturing in the 1990s. All significant reports of Liberal and Labor governments in the past have supported strongly the view that we should rationalise our union structure in Australia. This amalgamation is an example of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures that I now have from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that, indeed, on 30 June 1986 there were 326 unions in Australia, both Federal and State. This figure dropped to 295 by 30 June 1990. Since then, amalgamations have resulted in 19 fewer Federal unions, with a further drop of between six and 30 to be achieved by 30 June 1991.

        As far as dumping is concerned, it is absolutely clear that Australian producers have a right to be protected against unfair market competition. Indeed, the Government strengthened the anti-dumping legislation-and no doubt Senator Bjelke-Petersen supported that when it passed through the Senate in 1988-when we created the Anti-Dumping Authority. A review of the current anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements is under way at present. Quite clearly, a range of foods will be imported into Australia and, under State food law, all packaged foods must be labelled with their country of origin in order to allow consumers the right to make an informed choice about the origin of the goods-in particular the foods-that they buy. Recently the Government has taken action to stamp out the practice of imported fruit juice concentrate being processed in Australia and then labelled as a product of Australia. Under an amendment--

       <para>
        I should say that last year in Australia, as a result of industrial accidents in the workplace or disease, just on 400 people died and about 300,000 were injured. The cost to the Australian economy of this loss of production, not to mention the human trauma and suffering caused by it, is in excess of $10 billion annually. If we compare that with the indicator for time lost in industry through industrial disputes, we find that time lost through accidents and disease in Australian industry runs at about 12 times more than time lost through strikes. Therefore, in terms of priority, occupational health and safety certainly commands national attention on a major scale.
       </para>
       <para>
        Worksafe Australia is an agency of the Federal Government. It is chaired by a distinguished figure from the private sector, Mr Lou Marks, who was a chief executive officer of Brambles and, before that, Mayne Nickless Ltd. He is a recognised leading business person in his field, uniquely equipped to chair the tripartite body, Worksafe Australia, which contains representatives, as well as of the Commonwealth, of all State governments, of unions and of employers.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a consensus body that works, as all parties admit, on the basis that there is a need to find a tripartite view on reducing the level of accidents and disease in Australian industry. It works extremely well. All States, irrespective of political persuasion, recognise the need for Worksafe to remain, the need in Australia for us to achieve common national standards for safety and accident prevention in the workplace. Common national standards would certainly help major national companies in this country, as well as helping potential investors in industry to know exactly what the accident safety regime would be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently, Worksafe is dealing with a number of major causes of lost time in industry. It is conducting studies particularly on occupational back pain, noise-induced hearing loss, occupational skin disorders and injuries arising from the operation of mechanical equipment. It has conducted a recent study on chemicals in the workplace, and it is setting up a national commission, which will now oversee the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme for hazardous chemicals in the Australian workplace.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recent work of Worksafe Australia received international acclaim and respect. That study was refereed on a world level by distinguished authorities in other countries. Carried out over six years by Worksafe Australia, published and launched by me, I am pleased to say, it defined the damage caused by white asbestos in industry. It made a significant connection between white asbestos and the disease, mesothelioma. Once this disease is diagnosed, there is no cure for it and the recipient dies. As a consequence of that international study, there is now a possibility of people with mesothelioma, for which there is no cure, to at least achieve some dignity in their death and receive compensation for the disease they have suffered. It was a world-class study, and it received major national attention.

         —My question, which concerns Cambodia, is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the Australian Government's assessment of the apparent cease-fire that began in Cambodia on 1 May? Is the cease-fire holding? What further progress does the Minister look to being achieved at the forthcoming Jakarta conference on Cambodia? When I asked the Minister here in the Senate on 7 March, a little over two months ago, about the prospects for the comprehensive settlement being achieved, he emphasised that the only substantive issue remaining was the demobilisation or disarmament arrangements. What does the Minister suggest will be the likely solution to this issue in the Jakarta conference? What is the present state of Australia's readiness to participate in any international peacekeeping force that may serve in Cambodia? Has the United Nations yet made any official or informal approach to the Australian Government about this country's involvement in peacekeeping activity in Cambodia?

         —As to the first question, the Cambodian parties have all accepted the appeal issued jointly by the United Nations Secretary-General and the Paris conference co-chairmen on 22 April for a temporary cease-fire or cessation of hostilities in Cambodia to operate from 1 May, at least until after the proposed meeting of the co-chairmen and members of the Cambodian Supreme National Council, which meeting is likely to take place in Jakarta between 2 and 4 June.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Cambodian parties' acceptance of this appeal is an encouraging sign which everyone hopes augurs well for a productive meeting in Jakarta. The information available to the Government is that so far the cease-fire appears generally to be holding, although there have been some skirmishes since 1 May. Australia welcomed the further announcement that was made on 6 May by the United Nations Secretary-General and the Paris conference co-chairmen that they would send a military mission to Bangkok and Phnom Penh to review the situation first-hand. That mission, which comprises military representatives from France, Indonesia and the United Nations-that is, the two co-chairmen plus the United Nations, as well as a representative from the office of the United Nations Under-Secretary General, Rafiuddin Ahmed-is scheduled to visit zones controlled by the three resistance factions today and then to fly on to Phnom Penh tomorrow.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Jakarta meeting, about which Senator Teague has asked me and to which I referred, will focus on major unresolved issues, in particular military arrangements, including demobilisation, and guarantees to prevent the return of genocide, which is a theme rather mixed up with the question of demobilisation. I do not want publicly to canvass the various possible ways of resolving this difficulty, except just to say that there are a number of formulae and approaches presently being considered. Australia has been an active participant in the diplomatic discussion about those possibilities. I think there is a chance of them being resolved, although it is probably unrealistic to expect them all to be resolved at a single meeting.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we hope will happen in Jakarta is that it will at last clear the way for an early reconvening of the Paris conference coordination committee-that is, the Paris conference meeting at officials level. We expect that Paris conference to constitute the final negotiating phase of the peace process. That negotiating phase when complete will be followed by an implementation phase which will involve, among other things, a United Nations peacekeeping force. Again, it is premature to speculate publicly about the shape of any Australian contribution to that force. We have indicated a willingness in principle to participate in it, depending on the shape of the final settlement. There have been informal discussions, as one would expect, with the United Nations Secretariat about that, but nothing that remotely clarifies what our specific commitment would be. It would be quite premature to go down that path at this stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, it is Australia's judgment, and that of the vast majority of interested countries, that the United Nations peace plan for a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia still constitutes overwhelmingly the best available way of ending the conflict in that country and the suffering of the Cambodian people. Given the cumulative achievements of the past year, slow as they have been, and given the latest encouraging developments-and they are encouraging-relating to a cease-fire, it is our assessment that a comprehensive political settlement is now clearly within grasp. To give any confident prediction about the timetable or any confident prediction as to the actual outcome is difficult to do, given the inevitable uncertainties that continue to plague this process.

It has been the subject of some speculative discussion but, again, it is premature to bed down anything firm and final by way of offer or by way of expecting a commitment at this stage from the United Nations.

        I do not know the basis of the rules for making a decision should they, in fact, be persuaded and see the light that it is in their best interests to affiliate with the Australian Labor Party, and how they would go about deciding to do that, but I imagine that it would be by some form of plebiscite or referendum, which is the case with other white collar unions that in recent years have decided to break with the tradition of white collar unions and affiliate with the Labor Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might also point out that, since the matter of donations for political purposes or fees for affiliation is a matter of some public debate at the moment, all unions that are registered in the Industrial Relations Commission federally or in the State counterpart commissions under the State constitutions are required to file with the Commission a whole set of their financial records, duly and properly audited by a certified auditor.
       </para>
       <para>
        Within those records they are required to differentiate what donations they have made or what affiliation fees they have paid to outside bodies. In short, all trade unions registered in this country have total and open disclosure of political donations. That might be something that the Liberal Party can think about and apply to itself.

        We have taken a lead from the Industry Commission, which has said that it would be more economically efficient to require the manufacturer to show that a defect does not exist. In that respect we will be putting the onus of proof on the manufacturer to make it clear that the product which he has put on the market does not fall below a standard which the community can reasonably expect as far as safety is concerned. If he can demonstrate that the product does not fall below reasonable community expectations as to safety, he escapes liability.

But I believe that the general lines of the proposal, as I have indicated, will mean a marked improvement in product liability law in Australia and will certainly make it easier for people who are injured or who suffer property damage as a result of the use of defective goods to obtain the damages to which they are entitled.

In view of the effect on primary industry from the increasing subsidised imports of food amounting to over $2 billion a year, with examples such as canned tomatoes entering Australia with a $460 per tonne subsidy from the European Community, and in view of the new labour costs increase of $12 a week with 3 per cent superannuation and further wage rises due to spread to other industries, which have already been given Government agreement for Federal public servants and waterfront workers and are now claimed by metal workers, does the Minister agree that, with all the additional costs added to primary and secondary industry by these wage increases and the heavy subsidies given by the EC on food imports, it is imperative that Australia have an adequate anti-dumping and countervailing code before tariffs are further reduced? Will the Government give consideration to delaying the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 until both the Senate inquiry and the Government inquiry on anti-dumping bring down their reports? I ask the Minister whether in answering the question he will let Mr McEwen rest in peace.

Senator Boswell has to make up his mind what the cause of the problem is. It is an extraordinarily convoluted question, if I might say so. In one part of the question he alleges that the problems of the canned fruit industry are due to overseas subsidies and in another part he alleges that they are due to wages. A good starting point would be for Senator Boswell to make up his mind which is the particular sin which has to be addressed by anti-dumping.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That is something that those in the coalition did in government for 30 years with their made-to-measure tariff. In the last seven years of Tory government, coalition members could trot up to Malcolm Fraser and get made-to-measure tariffs whenever they wanted to. They passed on wage costs to the consumer and they did not worry about farm subsidies overseas; they went to the Prime Minister to get a made-to-measure tariff. That is what happened in their period of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        If coalition members are ever going to try to get out of that situation, they had better understand the principles involved. To tack wage increases on to this as part of the problem, when clearly it is not, is just an example of the idiocy which prevails in the National Party of Australia, which has always been successful in putting a burden around the necks of coalition governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Tate said earlier to Senator Boswell, some considerable changes were made to the dumping regime and announced in the 12 March statement. Amongst those was a change relating to the capacity of primary agricultural industries to complain in respect of dumping which affected a secondary processing industry. A Senate committee is considering the dumping regime at present and when that reports, the Government will further respond to the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, in spite of all the angst which Senator Boswell induces in here, it is true to say that more than 92 per cent of Australian food products are produced in this country. When Senator Boswell talks about the horror of some imported foods coming into this country, the matter should be seen in that perspective. As far as the dumping issue is concerned, there will be some further announcements in the near future.

         —In response to a question from Senator Hill on Thursday, 9 May, I said that Mr Brian Burke's resignation would involve a termination payment to him equivalent to 18 weeks and five days salary, calculated on the same pro rata basis as previously advised. I meant by that on the basis of a ministerial determination as to the appropriateness of such a payment, relying on the spirit of the existing compensation provision in clause 2 (A) (ii) of the terms and conditions of Mr Burke's appointment, but not the letter of that clause.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have had the benefit of some further advice on this subject following my giving that answer on Thursday afternoon. It is necessary and appropriate to state for the record the exact position about the circumstances and implications of Mr Burke's termination.
       </para>
       <para>
        The circumstances were these: it became apparent during the course of last Thursday when these matters were checked by my Department with the Attorney-General's Department that Mr Burke's resignation was not self-implementing. That applied both in respect of his original resignation of 29 April to take effect from 31 July, and also to the attempt to bring forward that date of resignation to last Thursday's date.
       </para>
       <para>
        The advice was-and I guess this arguably should have been clearer earlier but the fact is it was only checked on this occasion-that to be effective it had to be accompanied by formal action by the Governor-General to terminate the appointment. That followed in turn from such appointments being, by their nature, at the pleasure of the Governor-General and, as such, not terminable unilaterally; only by the Governor-General's action.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the procedure followed every time there is a changeover of ambassadors in a particular post-whether the appointee is a career public servant or a political appointment; whether the appointment runs its full intended term or is cut short; or whether, if it is cut short, that is as a result of resignation or early recall.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a grotesque misuse of language to claim, as so many members of the media have subsequently, that Mr Burke was, as a result of this procedure, either sacked or dismissed. He was no more sacked or dismissed than Doug McClelland was on the termination of his appointment recently as High Commissioner to London or Sir Robert Cotton was, for that matter, on the termination of his appointment a few years ago as Ambassador to Washington. Exactly the same procedure was followed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be that there was some misunderstanding of this point so far as the media were concerned, but I have to say that the Press Gallery was made fully aware last Thursday of the terms of the advice and the purely technical nature of the termination procedure in question, and, against that background, I can only describe a good deal of the reporting which has occurred subsequently as being quite shameless.

         —It is a badge of honour to be called disgraceful by Senator Walters. One consequence of a formal termination by the Governor-General being necessary to give effect to a resignation-which was not appreciated by anyone until the point occurred, it seems, to the Attorney-General's Department last Thursday-is that Mr Burke was in fact entitled, under the original terms and conditions of his appointment, to a termination payment equivalent roughly to one-third of his remaining salary for any early termination of his ambassadorship.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The point is, simply, that a termination is a termination is a termination. It is a neutral description of the process which occurs, whether that occurs as a result of resignation, dismissal or effluxion of time. Once one appreciates the procedures involved, the law is perfectly clear-and I should say there is no more credible foundation for Mr Peacock's fulminations on this subject in his press release over the weekend than there was for his earlier extravagantly wrong-headed allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am perfectly prepared to concede, as I have to, that there is an ironic quality to this particular revelation. Had the point been appreciated earlier, it certainly would have saved me, my Department and the Government an awful lot of trouble in the context of his first resignation on 29 April. But it is palpable nonsense to suggest that the Government is acting other than with absolute rectitude in the legal sense and every other sense in following the advice that has now been given to it.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill on 9 May 1991, relating to the termination of an appointment of the position of Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst, we were not, of course, given notice of that answer, it is inappropriate for me to speak in any detail at the moment. However, this is just another astonishing chapter in an astonishing saga. I understand that a further paragraph at least was written this morning when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) organised the press for a doorstop to make it clear-probably on the instructions of Senator Richardson-that Mr Burke's employment was not in fact terminated, that he was not sacked, and that the Government had become distressed over the weekend to find it being reported that he was.
       </para>
       <para>
        As of late last week the Government was acknowledging that that was the case. Therefore, the basis for the termination payment has varied-an irony or not, as the Minister says-as of last week when the Government accepted that Mr Burke's contract had been terminated, that is, dismissed by the Governor-General, and that Mr Burke was entitled to that money. This matter still has a long way to run because it seems clear, as it has seemed from the very beginning, that on a resignation the only basis for that payment the Minister decided to give to Mr Burke was purely as an ex gratia payment.
       </para>
       <para>
        That, of course, would lead the Minister down a difficult path because he would then have been required to get the consent of the Department of Finance which, in fact, was not sought or given. Therefore, the Minister has to continue down this tortuous path of saying, as the Senate has just heard, that a termination is a termination is a termination. In other words, if people resign, they are terminated. Clearly, in any common usage of the language, that is not so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister used that language in the Estimates Committee. He tried to justify this payment as a termination payment. It is not a termination payment. If his employment had been terminated he would, under the contract, have been entitled, but the Minister cannot have it both ways. The Minister could have it both ways in the Estimates Committee and he cannot have it both ways today.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, I think this matter still has a long way to run. Ultimately, the legal advisers will be forced to the conclusion that what the Minister has done is to make an ex gratia payment. He has not made it in the proper form. I do not know whether there is a retrospective capacity to correct that error-if there is, the Minister ought to do that now because, ultimately, if he does not do so, he may well find that the Commonwealth is forced to seek that this sum of money be repaid by Mr Burke. I simply put on the record that what the Minister has contributed today does not in any way further clarify the matter, but just continues to confuse an already confused and sorry saga. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         DILGEA surveys business migrants at the end of their first and second year in Australia to ascertain whether businesses have been established and the use to which capital is put. The department also has the facility to carry out checks with banks to establish whether the funds originally transferred by recently arrived business migrants have remained in the accounts.

       Telecom: 0055 Services

      </para>
      <para>
       1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.
      </para>

       2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.

       Medicare: Abortions

       To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:
      </para>
      <para>
       The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       * That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the right to life to all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       * That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.

       Report on Higher Education: Australian Capital Territory

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely effect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.

      <para>
       We are gravely concerned that the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is being threatened (i.e. Senator Ray's threat to withdraw funding from Radio Australia).

      </para>
      <para>
       We further petition that sufficient funding be made available to ensure that the democratic independence of the A.B.C. can be maintained by Government funding alone. We fear that the independence of the A.B.C. would be seriously compromised by sponsorship and advertising and this must not be allowed to happen.

        —I rise to oppose this motion whereby it is intended to debate cognately these two disallowance motions. The Australian Democrats feel very strongly that this is bad procedure. We wish to place on the record that we oppose the cognate debate, for reasons which I will now elaborate. I wish to advise that we intend to divide on this.

      <para>
       Behind the very complex sounding motion are two simple disallowance proposals relating to Austudy. They affect those who are entitled to Austudy and those who are entitled to retain it. There are two quite separate issues. The Democrats argue that to bring them together is to confuse the debate. There are two separate issues raised by two separate senators in relation to two separate principles. They arrived here together by sheer chance and not by intention, the chance being that, when the debate was before the chamber last Thursday, it was adjourned because some people were not ready to take part in it at that time. So now by sheer chance we find these two disallowance motions before the chamber. The Democrats believe that it is quite inappropriate that they be debated together.
      </para>
      <para>
       The effect of debating the motions cognately-and indeed, we would argue, the intention of doing so-is to reduce the number of calls available to those honourable senators who wish to debate these two very important issues. In fact, they are vital disallowances which relate to matters affecting battling, disadvantaged and disempowered Australians. Time and again, we hear questions asked and speeches made and the rhetoric is propounded about how ordinary Australians, including young Australians-the 27 per cent unemployed young Australians-deserve the support of government. Yet we have before us two disallowance motions which will, firstly, deprive many battling, disempowered and disadvantaged Australians access to Austudy and, secondly, deprive some who are already receiving Austudy from continuing to receive it.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is bad enough to have government by regulation, but it is very important that average Australians understand that the Parliament does not have the power to amend regulations; it merely has power to disallow them. Therefore, it is a tempting and frequently-used technique for governments to govern by regulation and to bring significant procedures before the chamber under regulations. We are very reluctant to forgo the time and the opportunity to reveal to the Australian public what the effects of these two disallowance motions are. As I have said, government by regulation is bad enough, but we find it unacceptable to then be deprived of the opportunity to debate the disallowance of the regulations even further by debating them cognately.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, we are not surprised that the Opposition will support the Government in debating these motions cognately-in other words, reducing the effective debating time and the number of calls available to debate the issues. I do not think it will be any surprise when we find in an hour or so from now that, indeed, the Opposition will vote with the Government against these disallowance motions to allow passage of regulations which impact adversely and grossly against disadvantaged and disempowered ordinary Australians in relation to equality of opportunity to education-one of the most fundamental principles of our society.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Democrats wish to place on the record the fact that we are opposed to this method of debating cognately these two important disallowances. We feel so strongly about the matter that we will divide on it.

        —I rise to support the case that has been put by Senator McLean and to argue against debating cognately the disallowance of these regulations. I do so because I agree with all that Senator McLean has said. Although such a rearrangement of Government business caught us by surprise, the case for keeping the motions separate was one which had been well made by us when we had discussed which different aspects of the Austudy regulations needed to be treated separately.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As Senator McLean has said, there were two separate issues raised by two honourable senators on different days. It is a matter of coincidence-at least I hope it is a matter of coincidence-that we find these motions for disallowance sitting together on today's Notice Paper. As a matter of fact, I am not so sure now that it is a matter of coincidence. It seems that there is a case for contriving to bring about that situation. It seems to me that a reason for such contrivance might be that, for one thing, the Government is not particularly keen to state a case because there is no case to oppose what we intend to disallow. So if the Government has no case to make it would, logically, like to reduce the time available for debate.
      </para>
      <para>
       It seems also that the coalition may be embarrassed by the separate case which is to be put by Senator Lees. It was when a similar case was put that the coalition became particularly nervous about the position it eventually found itself in, in agreement with the Australian Democrats. I refer to the derision and the heavy criticism to which the Government subjected the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, in the case for excluding the family farm as an asset in the test for the receipt of family allowance. When the Opposition supported us on that, Dr Hewson was subjected to continued criticism from the Government. Perhaps that hit home a little; perhaps members of the Opposition do not want to hear it again. Perhaps that is a reason for contriving to follow this course today. I do not know; I am not at all clear about it.
      </para>
      <para>
       But perhaps the coalition does not have any answers to our questions either-perhaps because it agrees with us. In preparing to speak in this debate today, I read in today's Adelaide Advertiser that the Opposition spokesman on education--

        —Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I conclude by making the point that the coalition may be quite happy for this debate to be a cognate one so that the fact that the Opposition spokesman on education, Dr Kemp, actually agrees with us may disguised. I base my claim that he agrees with us on an article in today's Adelaide Advertiser where it is reported that he said that:

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The assets test for Austudy was driving many rural students back to the farm because they did not take into account the dwindling income of rural families.
      </para>
      <para>
       He made that point in suggesting that changes needed to be made to the Austudy regulations. I think the case that Senator Lees will put later should be agreed to by the Opposition. Perhaps Opposition senators think that, by running this debate cognately, they can disguise that fact. But they cannot disguise it. It has been revealed, and it would be a lot easier if these motions were debated separately.

       Unfortunately, Senator Bell is too new in this place to know and understand how the system really works. To mention the fact that we in the coalition are obviously embarrassed about the issues that have been raised by Senator Lees is probably the most extraordinary thing that I have heard for a very long time in this place. The reality is quite the reverse. My colleague Senator Teague and many others will explain why we are not embarrassed about these issues but consider that they can be addressed quite adequately in a cognate debate and that adequate time will be made available to debate all the issues relating to these motions. It is not an intention of the coalition at all to have this debate curtailed and not discussed fully.

I was pleased to hear from Senator Knowles that the Liberals will be considering these issues in great depth and that there will be no confusion with these matters being debated together. However, my concern is that my move specifically is part of a series of attempts to remove a number of assets tests. They start with family allowance in which we were successful, but also include family allowance supplement, unemployment benefits and the age pension. My specific move to disallow is for a very specific purpose as part of a package. Hopefully we will be able to have a long look at what are tools of trade and what are assets that can be expected to be included in such assets tests.

        —The Government's view in this case is the same as that of the Opposition. I find it very rare for myself to be in that position, as Senator Knowles acknowledges. But we are talking about the one set of regulations that are the subject of this debate. We are talking about the fact that they are now before the Parliament because the Government has chosen to produce them in plain English language to assist the clients. That is essentially why they need to be processed through the Parliament. We are talking about different aspects of the regulations. Senator Lees wants to tackle one area; Senator Bell wants to tackle nine. If the Australian Democrats were being consistent, we might be having nine individual debates, but no-one is suggesting that.

       The point is-and I am sure that Senator Lees and Senator Bell understand this full well, and I find it rather incomprehensible that we are wasting the time of the Senate arguing this-that at the end of the debate we will be voting separately on Senator Lees's motion and on Senator Bell's motion. At that stage everyone will be putting their hands up or down to support or otherwise the individual parts of what will be a cognate debate. I suggest that it is a bit of grandstanding. The issues are important, but there is no need to waste the time of the Senate with a discussion as to whether we should have a cognate debate or not, when there are so many diverse areas adduced by Senator Bell's amendment, for instance, when we know full well that at the end of the day we will be taking separate votes on both of them.

        —by leave-I wish to raise another matter in relation to the placing of business. It relates to item No. 9 dealing with Government Business, government documents. Unfortunately, because there is no proposal pursuant to standing order 75, this item-the discussion of documents tabled earlier this day pursuant to standing order-comes on without these papers having been circulated for a sufficient amount of time for honourable senators to be able to read them and to establish their significance.
       </para>

      <para>
       Mr President, you will note that each one of the papers has an asterisk alongside it, stipulating that it is not available prior to tabling. One of the reasons that this problem emerges is because, for the convenience of the Senate and the media, Question Time has been elevated in the normal order of procedure. I do not know whether any of my colleagues wish to raise matters emerging out of these papers, one of which is important, that is, the Advance to the Minister for Finance which involves expenditure of many millions of dollars.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a result, I seek leave to move a motion which would defer consideration of item No. 9 until immediately prior to the resumption of Government Business.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That Regulations 5, 61, 63, 68, 71, 82, 85, 88 and 95 of the AUSTUDY Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 443 and made under the Student Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.
       </para>
       <para>
        These regulations contain some of the most blatant inequities in the Government's Austudy scheme. We are particularly concerned about the 1990 Budget changes to the spouse income test; the continued discrepancy between Austudy and the unemployment benefit; the age of independence; and the personal income threshold.
       </para>
       <para>
        My colleague Senator Lees will move to disallow the assets test regulations under division 2. The Australian Democrats believe that the family farm and small business assets should be exempt. Many young people are ineligible at the moment for Austudy because of their parents' occupation, although their parents may be earning little or no actual income.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the motion currently before the Senate, the Democrats challenge regulation 5 regarding the age limit on eligibility for Austudy. Regulation 5(a) provides that Austudy is paid only to students who are at least 16 years old. The rule is relaxed in regulation 5(b) for students who have reached the relevant school leaving age and are independent students who are orphaned, homeless, refugees or whose parents cannot exercise responsibilities. That is not in dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats believe that the age limit on eligibility for Austudy should be changed from 16 years to 15 years or starting in year 11, as alternatives, because discrepancies exist between States as to which years students are in what level of study and what age they are typically at that level of study. As it stands at the moment, this age limit is purely arbitrary and it is a device to reduce costs. The effect is to discourage gifted students from progressing through school at a faster pace. Students turn 15 or 16 in different years, depending on the starting age in the States. Currently a 15-year-old student in year 11 or year 12 is ineligible, while a 16-year-old student in the same class may qualify for Austudy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under regulation 61, the Austudy living allowance is still lower than the unemployment benefit for people over 21, except in a few exceptional cases. This discrepancy and its associated disincentive to study must be finally removed for all categories of students. For adults aged 21 and over, the single rate of unemployment benefit at the moment is $268.60 a fortnight, which is $119.50 higher than the Austudy at-home rate of $149.10 and $42.10 higher than the Austudy independent rate of $226.50 per fortnight. For married people, the Austudy allowance of $226.50 a fortnight compares with the payment of $243.20 to each member of an unemployed couple. Also, it must be taken into account that students who are on Austudy do not receive rent subsidies and other so-called benefits which are available to people who are currently receiving the unemployment benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The move to immediately raise Austudy to the level of unemployment benefit is supported by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the National Union of Students and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I emphasise that the National Union of Students is a union. That union's log of claims is very similar to the alterations presently being sought by the Australian Democrats, and that is a point which needs to be stressed to the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its April 1991 Report on Student Financial Assistance, the House of Representatives Committee supports the change in eligibility for Austudy to make it available to students under 16. The Australian Democrats welcome this report. We recognise the many submissions and the many months of work that were involved in the preparation of that report.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to regulation 63, with effect from 1 January 1991, the special rate benefit for people who have been unemployed for six out of the last nine months and who transfer over to Austudy will no longer apply to a married person with no children. This rule means that a recipient will go to a lower rate of benefit and be penalised for studying. That is because of the discrepancy between Austudy and the unemployment benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is where a complication, which is a trademark of Austudy, arises. It starts when an applicant for Austudy fills out the first form and has to address almost 100 questions. It continues throughout the regulations and the exceptions to the regulations to the point where, in regulation 63, there is an exception that if one received the special rate on this basis in 1990, it will continue. That is a transitional concession, which is probably admirable, but it just goes to show the sort of complication we have in this dog's breakfast of a set-up for students. Married students with children and sole parents do not lose payment under the new regulations. But if one is married and has no children, one is defined as a loser in this regard because one has lost some of the benefit one was previously entitled to.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regulation 68 is another one we are attempting to disallow because, according to the age qualification in this regulation, students must be 25 years old to be classified as independent of their parents. The Democrats believe that the age of independence should be reduced from 25 to the normal legal age of adulthood; that is, 18 years. This is the only area where a person aged over 18 years and up to 25 years of age is still treated as a child and assumed to be dependent on parental support. Such an assumption is contrary to social security and other areas where 18 is the age at which a person is independent of his or her parents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators and everybody else in Australia are familiar with the age of independence which allows a person to become a voter, to hold a licence to drive a motor vehicle, to take out health insurance, to legally consume alcohol, to engage in debts, to be killed in warfare and goodness knows what other things which mark the reaching of majority. But as far as Austudy is concerned, a person under 25 is a child and it is assumed that he or she will be dependent upon parental support.
       </para>
       <para>
        The House of Representatives Committee accepted the arguments which should derive from common sense and the arguments which challenge that ridiculous definition of independence. The Committee recommended that the age be reduced to 21. For budgetary reasons, the Committee recommended that this be achieved progressively. I have no argument with that at the moment; it is the principle which I fail to comprehend.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Union of Students believes that the age for independent status should be lowered to 18 years with an immediate reduction to 21 as a progressive step. The Democrats believe that it is only logical and fair that the age at which students are deemed to be independent should be reduced to 18 years of age. In support of that, I quote an example which came to our notice of a third-year engineering student. In a submission made in July-August 1990 by the University of Sydney Students Representative Council to the House of Representatives Standing Committee, the student is quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        I was refused Austudy because of the level of my parents' income. The fact that I received no money from them, have not lived at home for 4 years and live in a different state was deemed irrelevant. The Austudy office has explained that as I had not been thrown out of home, or suffered abuse or generally horrible home circumstances, I was not eligible for homeless Austudy and could not be considered independent either.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many other cases which have come to light which show that many 18-year-olds are financially self-supporting, even if they do live in the family home. We acknowledge that the use of age and other criteria to determine independent status is arbitrary and unrealistic. It ignores the actual financial circumstances of students, many of whom can demonstrate independence outside the criteria that are being used. However, until we use a better method, the age limit should at least be lowered to the normal legal age of 18 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to regulation 71. According to the work force qualification under regulation 71, students must have been employed full time for three of the last four years to qualify for independent status. We believe that the work force qualification should be reduced to two out of the last three years. If nothing else, justification for that change could be based upon the present employment situation, where the sort of work which students or intending students may find available to them has been drastically reduced. I would have thought that such a change would need little if any other justification.
       </para>
       <para>
        The return to the previous employment rule, as I have just described, is also supported by the House of Representatives Committee. In the present circumstances I would have thought also that some allowance could be made for part time work with a minimum number of hours per week to be decided. That again could establish the independent status of a great number of young Australians who have been independent but able to find only part time work.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to regulation 82, under which the personal income test threshold is currently at $4,000 and includes income earned during the long vacation. We believe that this figure should be increased. It is entirely unrealistic as it stands. Depending on the new threshold, it should again exclude pay over the long vacation. That is a matter of particular concern to a student who may be able to arrange a regular and reliable source of employment over the long vacation only to find that if, under an award or in quite correct recognition of experience, an employer grants a pay rise in the second or third years of that regular employment, that student has effectively disqualified himself or herself from receipt of Austudy for the rest of the year, or at least finds it very difficult to make a case-or perhaps it has brought such a hiatus into that person's receipt of Austudy that the question arises as to whether the employment and receipt of money was any good. In fact, this situation has brought a great deal of inconvenience to a great number of students.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part time work is increasingly difficult for students to find. Quite often, if it is offered, it should be accepted as immediately as possible, rather than being looked at and calculated with the student thinking, `Oh dear, I might go over my personal income threshold'. The quandary that some students find themselves in is whether to accept something that might take them over a threshold or to reject it and not find anything else for the next 18 months. That situation seems to have failed to be understood by those who administer these regulations or by those who designed them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The House of Representatives Committee found that Austudy students who find part time work are amongst the most highly taxed sector in Australia. Students lose $1 of Austudy allowance for every $2 earned over $4,000 and the Committee found that when normal tax is taken into account, this represented an effective tax rate of 75 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee Chairman, Labor member Mr Roger Price, said that the Austudy benefits and the personal income allowed fell well short of students' living costs, which evidence to that Committee suggests are about $12,000 per year. I would suggest that such an existence, for somebody who is attempting tertiary study, is at the very minimum of what we should expect our citizens to survive on. The Committee Chairman says:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is illogical and unjust that the Government has set levels (of income) which do not enable students to meet their cost of living, particularly those students who receive no parental support.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommended that the personal income threshold should be increased significantly. It suggests that allowable income should immediately be doubled to the level of $8,000 per year. Others have suggested that a personal income of around $10,000 would be more appropriate. This is not a gift that we are proposing for students; it is an encouragement for people to find part time work or regular vacation work which would allow them to accrue sufficient income to survive for the rest of the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        We recognise that Austudy was never designed as something upon which people could rely entirely, but to be able to survive properly a personal income level of around $10,000 per year has been suggested by others. We believe that an increased level can and should be negotiated before this year's Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also support reinstatement of the incidentals allowance for Austudy students to contribute towards textbooks and course-based costs such as lab coats, equipment, stationery, et cetera. These are the sorts of expenses that a student usually has to meet at the beginning of the year and that reduces the opportunity to deal with other incidentals during the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many tertiary institutions are finding any number of extra charges such as late application fees, particular course fees, photocopying fees, tutorial payments, payments for notes that are photocopied and produced for tutorial purposes. These fees, which I would question, are becoming commonplace in our tertiary institutions. They are all significant. We are not talking about 20c and 40c here and there; we are talking about hundreds of dollars in some cases that are applied by some tertiary institutions, it seems willy-nilly, as a revenue raising exercise. I may have more to say about that at another time, but this is the sort of thing which applies directly to many of those students who are having financial difficulty and are troubled by the Austudy regulations we now have.
       </para>
       <para>
        The methods that some of our students have to undertake to avoid the financial hardships that are caused by these regulations have been chronicled in a number of places and I refer to some of them now. According to reports in the Adelaide Advertiser and the Melbourne Sun on 6 September 1990, some tertiary students may be marrying and then separating to obtain Austudy benefits at favourable rates. This means that testing for Austudy was independent of their parents' income and that assets of their parents were not taken into account either, and it could have entitled them to greater benefits. Some of those sorts of contrivances are being encouraged by the regulations that we have before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other news from South Australia is that students are turning to prostitution in order to survive tough economic times and inadequate Austudy. That news is not limited to the South Australian press. Yesterday, 12 May, the Sunday Age carried an article which suggested that students turn to sex to make ends meet. There are other reports of such terrible circumstances in other parts of our media.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have even been claims by a spokesperson for the Prostitutes Association of South Australia, Mr Brett McMillan, who claimed that up to one-third of the State's 600 prostitutes were tertiary students. Reports in the Flinders University student newspaper, the Empire Times, on 21 March 1991 and in the Adelaide News on 11 April quote Mr McMillan as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Prostitution is about dollars. In the education system there have been increasing fees and more stringent tests for Austudy. Because prostitution is quick money and they can work nights, it's an alternative.
       </para>
       <para>
        I move away from that horrible state of affairs and turn to a matter which is perhaps less disturbing but similarly, involves a regulation which should be challenged-regulation 85. Under Budget changes, a step-parent who is normally in the same house has his or her income and assets taken into account in assessing a stepchild for Austudy. It might seem logical to assume that the step-parent contributes directly or indirectly to the study and living expenses of a stepchild. However, it is inappropriate to infer an imposition of that sort and, therefore, to impose an obligation as a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am reminded in passing that such assumptions are made often by this Government and I am surprised that it does not deem that such obligations are met. It seems to be fashionable at the moment for this Government to deem that all sorts of things take place. When a step-parent does not normally have any legal or financial obligation towards the stepchild, this is an illogical and unfair assumption to make.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until last year's Budget, if a student provided a declaration certifying that the step-parent did not contribute to his or her upkeep, eligibility was assessed on the income of the biological parent. But now the actuality is ignored-no matter what the actual financial arrangements are, the step-parent's income is to be included as part of parental income.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats believe that where a student can prove, by statutory declaration, that his or her step-parent does not contribute financially to his or her upkeep, the step-parent's income should not be considered for purposes of the parental income test. Surely that is a logical position to take. This Government is becoming increasingly capable of ignoring reality. I challenge the Liberal-National Party coalition to recognise that such ignorance should not be supported.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regulation 88, the parental income test of $19,300 per year is far too severe. That income level is well below the average Australian income and it must be increased. I am quoting the House of Representatives Committee quite often here because I agree with a great deal of what it found. I would note in passing that there were no Democrats on that Committee because it was a House of Representatives committee and I am pleasantly surprised by the sensible recommendations which that Committee made, independent of our advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am surprised here that in following its advice we received such a consolidated block of potential opposition from the major parties, because members of this Committee came up with recommendations with which we agree to a large extent. One of its recommendations was that the parental income threshold should be 75 per cent of the average male's annual wage, or $21,000 in 1990. It recommends that students from families with an income less than 75 per cent of that amount should receive full benefits. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee argues that the threshold should be 100 per cent of average weekly earnings, and the National Union of Students recognises that it should be at least that amount. So the present amount is certainly under question.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn briefly to regulation 95. The spouse income test threshold has been massively reduced by $6,000, from $18,150 to $12,150 per year. That is untenable. It is totally ridiculous to make that move in these regulations. That is a fundamental reason for our objection to this regulation. The Government has already backtracked on its lowering of the threshold under the parental assets test which it reduced to $200,000 a year and later restored and indexed to over $340,000. As we have argued-and I am sure Senator Lees will argue more strongly as well-this should now exclude farm and small business assets.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interim the Government should rethink these changes to the spouse income test. It is an incredibly harsh measure and it further excludes women in particular. It is particularly harsh on young couples, forcing them further into poverty. The spouse income test is a major barrier to participation of women in tertiary studies, particularly mature-aged women who want to enter the labour market through further education. As soon as the spouse income test is applied, effectively most people in that situation are excluded.
       </para>
       <para>
        This further restriction strongly discriminates against married women whose partners earn a higher part time income than their female counterparts, and many women have been forced to drop out of courses and others have been barred from entry because of it. It is my contention that this move demonstrates the Government's lack of real concern about the equity and access of people wanting to engage in tertiary studies. The Government should at least restore the spouse income test to the pre-Budget level. I can find no justification whatsoever for the proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        This motion to disallow these regulations and to reform Austudy is supported by the National Union of Students. Several student unions, student counsellors at tertiary and secondary levels, welfare groups, individual students and their families, farmer organisations and a number of other people who are directly and indirectly affected support this action. To suggest that the regulations should be passed because they are in plain English and, therefore, more easily understood, is to ignore the central effect of these things-that is, that they will bring new, harsh economic conditions upon those people in whom we trust to bring about our very future and they will insult these people by saying, `We want you to bring about a future for us', and then refuse to give them the economic wherewithal to do so.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, the Austudy scheme of student allowances for those in full time secondary and tertiary study is governed by the Student Assistance Act 1973. That Act is of small compass and, to make it work, it is required that there be regulations as defined in this Act. The regulations are very considerable, so for the past 17 years the Austudy scheme, or the tertiary education assistance scheme-TEAS-as it was formerly known, has been governed by the Act together with the regulations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the event of policy decisions made at the last Budget in August 1990, it was determined that the amending of the regulations to implement those policy changes ought to be accompanied with a comprehensive review of the regulations to put them into plain English, because they are one of the pieces of Commonwealth legislation that is most referred to by users-by students, staff, families, persons contemplating a course of secondary or tertiary study and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        They have already been much used for 17 years and, in fact, amended mostly every year, and there is a large volume of paper to show for it. I happen to have been asked by the former Minister, Kim Beazley, Sr, back in 1973 to be on the advisory committee for the first drafting of the original regulations under the Student Assistance Act. I was very proud to have served in that first formulation of these regulations. This was some five years before I was elected to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, there have been many good developments all to the same purpose that we had in mind in 1973, which was to make the later years of secondary and all tertiary study in Australia the more accessible to Australians of all ages; that is, by making sure that those in financial need were not denied the opportunity of following up their abilities and interests by enrolling in higher education and tertiary study generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say that by way of introduction to put in context that the Opposition has a bipartisan approach with the Government. The Opposition has just as often called for plain English versions of often-used law. This is a very good example of an outcome in which the regulations much used by the Australian public are now in plain English form. They are comprehensively put together and are, I believe, much more useable. It is a very welcome development that we have called for, which has been achieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not to say that the Opposition has confidence in the present Austudy scheme, the Act or these regulations. We went to the last election promising a complete review of Austudy. That means that in government we will completely review the Act and these regulations to ensure that the original objectives are being achieved. I will refer to many of the disabilities and inequities in the present Austudy arrangement before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, let it be quite plain from the start that we have before us two disallowance motions with regard to some of these regulations. Honourable senators can take the opportunity, with their being before us now, to put their spanner in the works and to try to get policy changes foisted upon the Government. The only way they can do that is by disallowing particular regulations. I will go to the merits of those attempts by Senator Lees, in the first case, and Senator Bell, in the other, to show that the Opposition is not convinced that these attempts to put a spanner in the spokes will lead to an overall improved situation in the regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is needed is a comprehensive review of the kind which we can only fully implement in government. However, the Opposition is calling for immediate action by the Government-and we hope, given the eloquent words of Senator Bell along similar lines, that the Australian Democrats will support this call by the Opposition-to make sure that there are provisions to help, particularly, farming families presently in terrible circumstances because of the rural crisis. I will come back to that later on.
       </para>
       <para>
        I begin by referring to Senator Lees's motion which she moved and spoke to on Thursday, 9 May 1991. That disallowance motion of Senator Lees which is before the Senate today seeks to disallow Austudy regulations 13 to 20 completely, thus removing the assets test from the Austudy regulations. It is important to understand that we are not being asked to disallow some of the assets test regulations, or to reduce the impact of the assets test on particular targeted classes of students such as rural students. The Senate is not able to amend the regulations in any way. This debate is about a black and white choice either to disallow all the regulations 13 to 20 that impose the assets test, or to allow them all to stand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress this point because much of what the Australian Democrats have been saying in the Senate and around the country has been to object to the impact that the Austudy assets test has on some students, particularly those from rural areas. However, what Senator Lees's motion would do is assist far more outside this targeted area of rural areas. This disallowance motion would benefit all students from families with assets exceeding $750,000, not counting the family home. That will cost more than $50m. That would mean that families with assets of more than $750,000, in addition to the family home-which would usually mean that the families would have at least $1m worth of assets, I put it to the Senate-would all be helped by the motion that Senator Lees has in front of us today; not just the families that everyone in the Opposition is concerned about, which are those suffering from the rural crisis.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, it will benefit all students. I do not believe, and the Opposition does not believe, that the Senate would be justified in taking such a broad-brush approach to this issue. In fact, the general case for retaining an assets test on Austudy alongside the present income test is a matter of fairness and equity. The Opposition reiterates its call for a thorough review and overhaul of Austudy which we will do when in government. In this review, the Opposition would accept the general case for an assets test on Austudy. For this reason, and for a series of specific reasons which I will go on to outline, the Opposition will not support this disallowance motion.
       </para>
       <para>
        There certainly are problems with Austudy and its assets test. One problem is the immediate need for rural families to be assisted by the introduction of hardship provisions for Austudy as stated in the Opposition policy. However, we are not now debating legislation which the Senate can amend. We cannot, here in the Senate, replace these regulations with an amended or alternative policy. Therefore, I will indicate to the Senate the main elements in the Opposition's policy on this matter, a policy which we urge the Government immediately to adopt. I ask Senator Bolkus and his advisers to note that we will be proposing direct, immediate action by the Government to implement hardship provisions especially to help those families suffering in the rural crisis.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Labor Government lacks the political will to do this-to introduce hardship provisions to immediately assist rural families-I indicate now, on behalf of the Opposition, that we will introduce reforms as set out in the Opposition policy when we come to government. I will now move, on behalf of the Opposition, an amendment to Senator Lees's motion. I move:
       </para>
       <para>
        Omit all words after ``that'', substitute: ``the Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from AUSTUDY by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds''.
       </para>
       <para>
        In support of that amendment, I refer to this morning's Australian and quote the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). Today's Australian at page 5 says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Kerin said yesterday that Cabinet confirmed on April 17, when funding to the Rural Adjustment Scheme was increased by $100 million to $164 million, that farmers were eligible for hardship provisions under the Social Security Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Kerin said many farmers would not be aware of the range of facilities available through Section 7 of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        ``Farmers who meet the other normal eligibility conditions may qualify for support under hardship provisions and may receive unemployment, sickness, or special benefits and pensions'', he said.
       </para>
       <para>
        Assets tests do not come under consideration in hardship provisions if the property cannot reasonably be expected to be sold or used as security for borrowings.
       </para>
       <para>
        If payments are granted, the value of assets which cannot be sold or borrowed against will not be counted under the assets test.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat that last statement. These are the Minister's words:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the value of assets which cannot be sold or borrowed against will not be counted under the assets test. The benefit paid to the farmer then depends on a special income test.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is discussion in the report as to what that income test is. The income test is considerably less onerous than is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's amendment in respect of educational allowances calls on the Government to immediately implement a parallel set of hardship provisions. We are quite specific as to the exact form of words of those hardship provisions. The Opposition does not have the facilities of government to have the precise knowledge of all the existing hardship provisions in other legislation or know the best way to frame this against the present Austudy regulations, but we are very confident that the Government has the competence to implement the amendment that I have now put before the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate of the Opposition's policy at the last election. Our higher education policy included the following statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        As budgetary circumstances permit, a Liberal/National Government will work to improve the support given to needy students through Austudy and Abstudy. Particular regard will also be given to the needs of regional and rural students who have to travel long distances, or be accommodated away from home, to attend higher education institutions. We will establish a realistic assets test including a hardship provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        I continue to quote from the policy of the Opposition:
       </para>
       <para>
        Austudy has been bedevilled by administrative deficiencies and suffers from continuing allegations of unfairness in the award of benefits. The Liberal and National Parties will, in government, thoroughly review the rules and administration of Austudy to ensure that they are fair to all and that the scheme runs smoothly.
       </para>
       <para>
        That will be a great improvement to Austudy, but it is not enough. We can put that into practice when we are in government, but we are calling upon the Government directly to act. With Democrat support, the policy determined by the Senate today will be that there be immediate action on the introduction of hardship provisions to assist rural families.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similar words appear in our schools policy, which also refers to our approach to the assistance for isolated children scheme, where, in contrast to Austudy and for distinctive reasons that distinguish the common needs of all isolated families, our undertaking is to abolish the assets test for the AIC scheme, it would remain. In government, we will remove the assets test on the isolated children scheme. I also remind the Senate that the Opposition has already successfully acted on its policy to resist the Government's attempt to implement an assets test on family allowances.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the general question of principle of an assets test on Austudy, it is the Opposition's long held view that Austudy benefits should be targeted to those in greatest need. We do not believe that the country can afford to have them available to all. Even the extension of Senator Bell's motion-which I will come to in a moment-will cost more than $1 billion. Senator Lees's motion will cost more than $50m, but Senator Bell's motion will cost $1 billion. An actual estimate was given to me of $1.2 billion, but I have given Senator Bell the benefit of the doubt by only quoting $1 billion. I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), when he comes to sum up, to say whether the estimate of the cost involved in the extra Austudy is $1 billion or the $1.2 billion that Senator Bell's motion would entail. What extra taxes would the Democrats impose to gain that kind of money?
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that Austudy should be not a universal living allowance but targeted at those in greatest financial need. At the moment, only 40 per cent of students receive Austudy. The targeting of Austudy benefits to those in greatest financial need has been the firm foundation not only of Austudy but of TEAS in the previous 17 years and of the Commonwealth scholarship scheme before that, right back to when Menzies introduced it in the middle 1950s. I ask the Democrats whether they intend to abandon that basic foundation of the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, the TEAS scheme and the Austudy scheme. If so, I ask them to tell us where the money is coming from. What extra taxes will be placed on Australians, including farmers and rural families, to pay for the amount involved in Senator Bell's motion?
       </para>
       <para>
        However, we point out that there are real problems with the way in which the assets test is operating at present. Hence I turn to the need for the hardship provision that our amendment calls for. We in the Opposition have been directly critical of the way in which the Government is administering the Austudy scheme. We are also critical of government administration of the assets test, especially the evaluation procedures which, in rural areas, have been notoriously inept, onerous and unfair. It is no wonder that we are getting hundreds of calls in our offices about the inept, unfair and onerous administration of the evaluation procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have drawn a distinction between the assistance to isolated children (AIC) scheme and the Austudy scheme with regard to assets testing. Austudy's whole rationale is to provide financial support for students who might otherwise not be able to support themselves adequately during their studies. It is a financially targeted concept. It follows that it is logical that some form of assets test be part of the eligibility requirements for Austudy. On the other hand, the AIC, the isolated children scheme, is best seen as a form of compensation by the community for the additional costs involved in obtaining access to education for students from isolated areas; that is, the AIC scheme is for all students from isolated areas. An assets test does not logically fit with the concept of the AIC scheme. The Opposition is opposed to an assets test on that scheme; we have said so in our policy. I reiterate that it is our policy now and we will take it to the coming election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Things are very wrong with aspects of the present Austudy scheme and its present assets test. The Opposition is critical directly of the Government, as I have said. There is genuine concern and alarm in the rural community about its fairness and administrative efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the present crisis and the fortunes of Australia's primary production sector, farm families are being unfairly hit by the assets test. It is possible for families with low or even negative incomes to be excluded from receiving Austudy because the book value of farms remains relatively high. The Government has constructed this assets test on the assumption that assets can readily be converted to cash. But that is not the case. In fact, this is an entirely inappropriate assumption for the Government to make about our rural areas at the present time.
       </para>
       <para>
        As opposition senators would say again and again, a farmer cannot sell half his station to get some cash to pay a current need like a child's allowance. To be viable, a farmer has to keep the station or keep the eventual base for an income by having a viable sized farm in any area of primary production.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been particular problems in my own State of South Australia. This is parallel to other parts of the country. Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia have real problems such as those in South Australia. I urge the Government to approach demands for repayment with great sensitivity when an upward revaluation of a property indicates that Austudy should not have been paid to a particular student and money is then demanded by the Government to be repaid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even when repayments have to be made, I have learned of numerous instances where students or their families have thought that a large sum of money had to be repaid immediately rather than, as is the case, repaying by way of reasonable instalments which are negotiated with representatives of the Austudy scheme. There have been those-they are not from the Opposition-who, for their own political purposes, have gone around the country playing on the anxiety that has resulted from all of this. Let it be made clear, however, that there are procedures for reviewing such situations to which families can appeal. When a review is applied for, the demands for repayment are then frozen until the matter is determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats have had a lot to say in rural areas about these issues, but not all of it has been balanced, and they have sometimes heightened the distress already felt by rural families by playing on anxieties. I wish to commend the statements made not only by Neil Andrew, the honourable member for Wakefield, but also by Senator Olsen, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and, indeed, other Liberal senators and members in my State who have not increased the anxiety but who have acted in a practical way to direct families to the appeal mechanisms and have indicated what their rights are, what the procedures are and what they should expect.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my own case, I have received an enormous number of distress signals from the Eyre Peninsula, the Mallee and many other rural areas. At the weekend Dr Michelmore of Karoonda telephoned me to say that his patients throughout the whole region of the middle Mallee in South Australia are showing physical symptoms of acute distress. We are very aware that this is the time for planting and the time when judgments have to be made on outlaying extra capital in order to see a return. We need to see this Government respond immediately to the Opposition's call as set out in the amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now refer to the problem of valuations. My time is limited, so I have cut down my speech. The valuations of the Australian Valuation Office are often higher than valuations made by local or State government or private sector valuers. They can lag behind shifts in the local real estate market. Of course, in the last 18 months there has been an enormous decline in the actual value of rural properties. The Australian Valuation Office is behind the times. In answering this problem, I ask the Government to make sure, not just through the appeals mechanism, but administratively, that the valuation procedure is up to date and is not inflated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also refer to the sudden death nature of the cut-off point; there is no tapering provision in the assets test. The straight deduction for debt does not make any allowance for the proportion of debt on a property and the administration of the system of appeals is sometimes felt, by those affected in these ways, to be insensitive and demeaning.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the attention of the Senate to a recent report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment Education and Training. I welcome this comprehensive report in which some of my colleagues participated very usefully. I do not have time to include in my speech further consideration of that report, although I have several pages of comments that I would have liked to refer to.
       </para>
       <para>
        Disallowing these regulations today would not help to move Austudy policy or administration in the direction that the Opposition is advocating. Only a change of government will achieve that, and only the Government's response to our amendment will ensure the immediate response that we regard as important. The Democrats motion, therefore, does not warrant the Senate's support. The Democrats want to use this occasion to parade as friends of the farming community, but what hypocrisy this is. The Democrats advocate a whole series of policies that are in fact damaging to the rural sector. I will list some of them. The Democrats support Labor's capital gains tax.

They want death duties on properties which are worth more than $300,000 and they want to reduce, and eventually ban, intensive animal production. The Democrats are no friends of the farming community. They are using the Austudy issue to try to cover up their anti-farmer policies. To do so is in fact a political fraud-and I have not referred to the increase in taxes that the Democrats want to place on rural communities.

       <para>
        The Opposition does not support this disallowance motion. The motion does not, and cannot, offer a means of carrying out the changes to Austudy policy and administration that the Opposition advocates. The improvements and reforms to which we are committed will occur when we are in office and are able to implement them, and when the Government responds directly to our amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have only a few minutes in which to refer to Senator Bell's motion. I will speak briefly and indicate that the Opposition cannot support this motion because it would make the Austudy scheme inoperable as of today. For a start, it would disallow regulation No. 61 which sets the rates of allowance. By abolishing that section alone we would have no Austudy scheme as of today.
       </para>
       <para>
        It appears from Senator Bell's speech and from the attitude of the Democrats generally that they do not understand the effect of the passage of his motion. I do not really believe that this unintended consequence of gutting Austudy is the deliberate objective of Senator Bell and the Democrats. Surely it is an unintended consequence, but it is a consequence and it is factual. Will the Minister refer directly to this? I ask the Minister: will there be an Austudy scheme if Senator Bell's motion for disallowance is in fact adopted today?
       </para>
       <para>
        I make it clear that we do not support the abolition of regulations 61, 63, 82, 88 and so on. I have already referred to the cost, which will be at least $1 billion. Not one Democrat senator has referred to where this $1 billion or $1.2 billion in additional spending would come from if their objectives, as stated, were to be achieved, that is, to make Austudy available to not only those in financial need but also even the affluent students, those who are not in the targeted group of those in greatest financial need.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have then the ludicrous position whereby the whole Austudy scheme would be rendered useless if Senator Bell's motion were to be passed today by the Senate. I therefore regard this approach, with such dire unintended consequences, as slapdash and irresponsible. I am afraid that this type of approach has become typical of that adopted by the Democrats when they want to grandstand, in a populist way, in order to appeal to particular groups in the electorate. In the case of Senator Lees, it is rural areas and, in the case of Senator Bell, it is the National Union of Students and students generally, not just those in financial need.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Democrats want to grandstand and gain some sort of support from particular groups such as these, they know that because their attempt in the Senate is irresponsible it will be thrown out by the Government and the Opposition, and they can then go about and say, `We tried to help you, even though it was in an irresponsible way and a way which would not be effective and we didn't tell them about the cost'. Therefore, the Democrats are able to say that they have been frustrated by the Government and the Opposition in gaining the goodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regard that kind of wish-list, irresponsible approach by the Democrats as being all too typical of its appeal to be popular with particular sectional groups in the community. I reject that approach and the Opposition rejects this disallowance motion.

         —In coming before the chamber today, the Australian Democrats advance the argument that what they are doing is designed to advantage family farms and people with small businesses. However, I believe that the motions put forward by both Senator Lees and Senator Bell disclose another agenda, a secret agenda, in the educational debate-that is, to make Austudy available, not just to those people who need Austudy, but to every single person who happens to be at university.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The effect of Senator Lees's motion, which is a motion for disallowance of regulations which relate to the assets test, is to effectively strike out, lock, stock and barrel, the assets test, not just on the family farms and small businesses from one end of this country to the other, to which she refers so frequently, but on absolutely everything. But this is not what Senator Lees has told the people to whom she is trying to sell her policy. At this point, I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard a media release issued in the name of Senator Lees, dated 7 February 1991, entitled `Democrats launch Austudy access plan for country students' and the attached notice of motion.

        DEMOCRATS LAUNCH AUSTUDY ACCESS PLAN FOR COUNTRY STUDENTS
       </para>
       <para>
        South Australian Democrat Senator Meg Lees today launched her party's ``Austudy Access'' plan for country students at Booleroo Centre in the State's mid-North.
       </para>
       <para>
        The three point plan is aimed at making education allowances more available to country students by relaxing the assets and income tests applied to parents' incomes and by varying the eligibility criteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent figures have shown that Australian farmers in general have very little formal education when compared with their OECD competitors. It is estimated that 75% of farmers did not get to the senior years of high school.
       </para>
       <para>
        While these figures reflect the ageing of farmers as a group, and younger farmers are better educated in comparison, the Australian Democrats believe there are obstacles put in the way of farming families when they seek education for their children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Launching the plan Senator Lees said: ``The Australian Democrats believe that country children are being disadvantaged in their access to upper secondary and tertiary education. One of the most important reasons for this disadvantage is limited access to Austudy and other education allowances.

        Senator Lees said that the new generation of farmers would continue to be Australia's economic backbone well into the next century.

         —I thank the Senate. I take the opportunity to highlight what is said in this press release so that people can really understand what Senator Lees is trying to do. Senator Lees has been telling everybody, from people in Isolated Childrens Parents Association branches-and I got this material from an ICPA branch in Queensland-to producer organisations and anybody who would be silly enough to listen to her speaking from the back of a truck, that there is a three-point plan aimed at making education allowances more available to country students by `relaxing the assets and income tests applied to parents' incomes and by varying the eligibility criteria'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, what we have in the motions from Senator Lees and Senator Bell is completely different from that. They are not going to relax the assets test because, by the time Senator Lees is finished with what she is doing, there will not be an assets test. We are not varying by any small degree the eligibility criteria, because Senator Bell's motion effectively hands Austudy to any people who happen to have their hand out at the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        If Senator Bell's motion did not make the scheme inoperable, it certainly would make the scheme totally unfeasible. The real agenda behind the Democrats and what they are doing in the chamber today is certainly not designed to advantage the school students in particular who come from country areas. Instead, their plan is designed to hand out more welfare and more assistance to their suburban supporters in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra. Senator Teague has stated so well today that the real cost just of Senator Lees's motion would be $60m, most of which would end up in the cities-not in the country where it is needed, not assisting school students--

        Not all the cost will be related to assistance to students in country areas.

She is trying to advantage her suburban supporters in the cities; nothing less.

        If Senator Lees really stood by her access plan for country students, she would be supporting Senator Teague's amendment, which I shall be supporting this afternoon. If Senator Lees were really concerned about assisting people in country areas who are affected by this government-inspired rural depression, she would be targeting her assistance at those people in country areas. Instead, she comes before the Senate and says, `We are going to throw out the assets tests, lock, stock and barrel'.

        I asked members of the ICPA and people in country areas, ranging from Cape Tribulation, Charters Towers and Emerald to other areas in provincial Queensland, what they thought of the idea of making the assets test a non-entity, of throwing it out and giving Austudy money to everybody who comes along, irrespective of their circumstances. Overwhelmingly, they said that they could not support throwing out the assets test. They said that in this time of financial stringency it is necessary to be careful how we spend the dollars. Their concern is to ensure that the assistance that we do give-and we must give assistance-is targeted to the people who are really in need. Yet Senator Lees--

It shows the absurd, ridiculous attitude of the Democrats. It shows how their policy is totally inconsistent with the sorts of things they do when they come into the Senate chamber. I only wish that the people of provincial Australia knew of the sorts of things that the Democrats were doing and knew of their policy hypocrisy. I flatter them by calling it `policy hypocrisy'; it is just hypocrisy, or whatever happens to suit them at the time, that they perpetrate in the Senate and then try to peddle to people throughout Australia.

        For those reasons, there is no way in which I, as a responsible member of this Senate, as a person who is truly interested in country students-and not just university students; all students-can support this motion. Even if this motion were passed today-and I do not believe that it will be-the funny thing is that it would make the Democrats' Austudy access plan for country students totally superfluous and of no effect at all. The Democrat policy, as enunciated in the access plan for country students, talks about changing valuation criteria; but there is no point in changing valuation criteria if there is no longer anything to value.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe Senator Lees is an acrobat, because the policy backflip that is effected by the motion she brings before the Senate today is quite extraordinary. She parades herself around country South Australia by putting out a press release. She sends it to people living as far away as Cape Tribulation and goodness knows where in Western Australia. She puts forward this policy, saying, `This is the brave new world; this is the Democrat vision of how we are going to improve access and equity for country students', and then she moves a motion in the Senate that will disallow regulations and have the effect of making her policy a nonsense. I suppose the argument that it makes her policy a nonsense is a bit flattering anyway, because those of us who look at it in the cold, hard light of day recognise the fact that the Democrat policy is and always has been a nonsense, that the things that Senator Lees is doing here today are indeed a nonsense.
       </para>
       <para>
        But what is worse is that, by saying one thing and doing another, Senator Lees has taken advantage of people who are vulnerable, who are upset and who are looking for any life raft onto which they can possibly grasp. She is really playing upon using those people who are in vulnerable circumstances. I, for one, am particularly disturbed that a member of the Senate can tell people that the Democrats are doing one thing and then come in here and do another. For that reason, I have no intention of supporting the sort of nonsense motion that Senator Lees has bought into this chamber, a nonsense motion that will make nonsense of a nonsense Democrat policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we come to the issue of whether we should be trying to target Austudy, or whether other things need to be done that should have a greater priority. On Friday members of the National Party met with the Federal executive of the ICPA. We asked those people in our meeting whether they thought it was worth while backing the Lees motion with its intention to abolish the assets test for Austudy. The answer was very interesting. It was an unequivocal no. They said that Austudy is not a priority so far as the ICPA is concerned, because Austudy is intended to assist principally, though not entirely, students at tertiary institutions. But my concern is for the people who in the current rural recession will not get to a tertiary institution because they will not finish high school or because, although they might finish high school, they will not have access to the sort of education that will get them the tertiary entrance score to enable them to get into a tertiary institution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the assistance for isolated children (AIC). As I said, the ICPA was unequivocal in its opposition to abolishing the assets test on Austudy while at the same time maintaining an assets test on AIC. This would be the effect of the Democrat motion. In other words, if one happens to have a child who is in primary school, in grade 8, 9 or 10, or even a grade 11 and 12 student who is not eligible for Austudy, that is too bad-the assets test will remain. It is too bad that the student cannot get to school, too bad that the student cannot get a proper high school education. But at least the trendy intellectual who lives in a city and votes Democrat and who has enormous amounts of assets, the Democrats say, will be allowed to get a tertiary education.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very concerned for the primary and high school age children who will not get a proper education under this Democrat motion. That is why we in the coalition support what the ICPA is doing, and why we have as part of our policy a firm and thorough commitment to abolishing the assets test on assistance for isolated children. Why should we abolish the assets test for assistance for isolated children and not do so in respect of Austudy? The answer is simple. It is that there is a substantial difference in intent between the assets test for assistance for isolated children and that for Austudy. Indeed, there is a fundamental difference between AIC and Austudy. Assistance for isolated children is intended to even out the inequities of distance that strike parents and students who live in remote areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ICPA said, I believe correctly, that AIC should be approximately 55 per cent of boarding costs at high school. The reason is that that would be roughly the difference in cost between living at home and boarding at a school. For many people in far-flung areas in my State, and I know for many people in far-flung areas such as Western Australia-and I recognise that Senator Knowles and Senator Crane have come to this chamber with very real concerns for these people-it is the tyranny of distance and the inequities which that distance impose on students that will defeat many of them. It will prevent many of them from getting to high school and from studying the subjects in which they want to achieve.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there is a limited public purse available, then as far as I am concerned our first and foremost obligation must be to give these students a chance to get to university rather than assisting the people who are already at university, who tend on the whole to come from the cities. Senator Lees herself has identified the fact that a disproportionate number of university students are from country areas, and the question is: why? The answer is that the AIC has been allowed to slip away, has been shackled by an assets test, and now no longer achieves its stated intention, which is to equalise the disadvantage suffered by people in remote and rural areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hasten to add that in 1973 there were 30,000 AIC recipients; by 1989 there were 13,000 AIC recipients; and by 1990 there were 9,000 AIC recipients. The coalition's policy would increase the number of recipients for assistance for isolated children's allowance and would allow more of these children-primary school children, children in years 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12-a chance of a decent education at high school or primary school just like their city cousins.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the things that strikes me as absurd about an assets test for AIC is that one of the assets of a professional person who lives in a city is a degree. It is the diploma people put on the wall; whether it is a law degree, a medical degree, a teaching diploma or whatever, it is an asset. That assists in keeping one's family, yet that asset is wholly untested by this existing policy on AIC. Yet if one happens to work with one's hands or works on the land, or is a truck driver or a baker, or any person who has not had the advantage of a university education, all one's assets are tested and taken into consideration. It strikes me that it is a grave inequity that favours city intellectuals rather than the people who live in the country who work with their hands and who suffer most in this current Government-engineered recession. I think that is wholeheartedly absurd and offensive to the principle that every Australian is equal and deserves equal consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats are not really assisting the children from isolated areas; they are assisting the adults and the perpetual students. They are assisting their own supporters in the cities rather than doing what they say they are doing, which is assisting the isolated children. I understand wholeheartedly what is going on in country Australia. I understand the horror that is being experienced.

It will be very interesting to see whether Senator Bell will support it. It will be interesting to see him putting his feet where his mouth is. I understand that Senator Bell does that quite frequently, but this time I want him to walk across the chamber and vote with us on our amendment. Interestingly enough, our amendment will give more effect to the Democrats' access for country students policies than would the motion that is now brought before the chamber by Senator Lees. If the Democrats really believe in their policies, they will support the amendment moved by Senator Teague. If the Democrats do not believe in their policies, they will show the craven nature of the things they have been doing to vulnerable people in country Australia by voting against it, by blocking it, by moving to support not the people who are affected in country areas but their own intellectual supporters in the cities who have their degrees, who are not assets-tested on those degrees and instead are looking to disadvantage the people who live in country areas. That is why I find Senator Lees's proposal so absurd.

        I move on briefly to Senator Bell. It is only fitting that I be brief in dealing with his motion because it will not take long to dispose of. Senator Teague suggested in the debate earlier this afternoon that the cost of Senator Bell's motion would be in the vicinity of $1 billion. He would be doing away with the income test, the test that five minutes ago Senator Bell interjected in my speech was worth keeping. The Democrats would be doing away with the spouse test and with all the other eligibility criteria referred to in Senator Lees's policy. Maybe there is a policy difference between Senator Bell and Senator Lees.

        Let me now turn to the matter of the $1 billion cost that Senator Teague has identified in his speech today. The most eloquent, the most perceptive and the most cutting argument that Senator Bell could come up with by way of interjection was, `It's your estimate of cost, not ours'. However, what we have not heard from the Democrats this afternoon is their estimate of the cost. As far as the Democrats are concerned, cost is irrelevant. It is irrelevant to their pie-in-the-sky plans; it is irrelevant to the promises that they make in the electorate; and it is irrelevant to their wish list, which in this case includes the abolition of the income test, put by Senator Bell just minutes before he said to me that it was necessary to preserve the income test as a safeguard.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, if I were to liken the proposals put by Senator Lees and Senator Bell, taken together, to anything at all, I would liken them to a sort of creeping, subversive, Fabian socialism-the type of attitude that says that we will give money to people left, right and centre, we will make people everywhere dependent on government handouts, instead of giving them the opportunity to get on with their lives for themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        How will we pay for these sorts of things? Where will we find the $1 billion? The answer is that the $1 billion will come not from income taxes, not from taxes on people's ability to pay but, according to the Democrats' proposal, from an inheritance tax. An inheritance tax is just a death duty by another name. What is the point of encouraging university students from country areas to go to university when, if their parents die, they will not be able to keep the family farm and will have to sell it to meet the Democrats' inheritance tax? This is the truth behind the Democrats' policy. It is the truth behind the way these people attempt to fund their as yet uncosted wish list.

         —It is the politics of envy-thank you very much, Senator Knowles. The real cost is probably even more than the $1 billion that Senator Teague has identified. It is probably much worse than the $57m under Senator Lees's proposal. The real cost is the heartbreak and the hurt that these Democrat policies will cause people in the bush. At a time of bereavement, when a person's spouse or mother or father who has a share in the family farm dies, the Democrats will send people around to assess the farm. They will ask that person for a share of the value of that farm, ask him or her to cough it up, otherwise he or she will not be able to inherit it. That is what a death duty is; that is what a Democrat inheritance tax is. It is sending an assessor around to assess a person's farm just days after his or her parents or spouse has died, and asking that person to cough up a cheque to pay for a share of the value of a farm that has been in the family for generations. I find that iniquitous and offensive, particularly at a time when people are suffering a bereavement. That is the real truth about how the Democrats would run this country. For those reasons, and taking it in a complete context, I do not believe that anyone who is reasonable or anyone who has any real concern for people in country areas could support this Democrat proposal. I certainly will not do so.

So, in reality, there is no substance, impact or effect to come from the amendment that Senator Teague has moved. It will deliver nothing whatsoever if it is carried here today-as it probably will be. The disallowance of these regulations would deliver something and would alleviate some of the agony that is being experienced in rural communities. In a few minutes from now National Party senators will do nothing about the regulations, but with much flurry they will support an amendment of no consequence whatsoever. This is the essence of the debate: utterances of no consequence. The only thing of consequence that can happen here today is the disallowance of these regulations. We have heard a lot of hot air.

         —The hot air that we heard from Senator O'Chee a few minutes ago was born of the panic that will be in his guts in an hour from now when he has to do something of consequence. I have been into the rural communities, talking mainly on the issue of banking. In the context of deregulated banking, I believe that a great deal of the blame for the rural crisis that we are seeing now can be sheeted home to greedy banking. Rural Australia is now confronted with the plague of indebtedness. That in itself is bad enough. It is an indebtedness, as I have argued over and over again, that is substantially born of deregulated banking-but not totally. Even when confronted with that plague of indebtedness, farmers are still hopeful for the future of their children. They are still hopeful that they will have access to the great Australian entitlement of equality of opportunity, including educational opportunity. Today we have an opportunity here to disallow regulations which are reinforcing massive inequality in relation to access to education.

        We see the situation in rural Australia where, due to greedy banking and this rampant plague of indebtedness, many farmers have been reduced to little more than peasant farmers. Some decades ago they were called serfs. We remember that in 1917 there was a revolution, which has been so derided, in order to throw over a set of circumstances in another country that were not really unlike those that many people in rural Australia find themselves in today. It is little more than serfdom, little more than peasant farming, toiling probably for the rest of their lives to service debt that was imposed upon them by irresponsible bank practice and inappropriate Government policy in introducing deregulated banking.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I was on the Eyre Peninsula, a farmer, who I do not believe would cry very often, came to me following a public meeting and told me about the circumstances in which he finds himself. In 1980, he borrowed $120,000 from his bank and since then he has paid the bank $290,000 in repayments and he still owes the bank $185,000. He will never pay that debt in his lifetime, and nor will his children, if they retain the property and keep working it. That is little more than serfdom or peasant farming. One could cite hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands and thousands, of farmers across this nation in similar circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government, supported by this Opposition-the deregulators gone crazy-has imposed upon rural Australia the deregulation not only of banking but also of the primary sector at large, and the deregulation of almost everything that allowed the rural sector to support this country so proudly for so many decades. This is what I am being told by the farmers in my constituency, which is mine as much as it is Senator O'Chee's.

        We see before us today two sets of regulations which, if endorsed by this chamber-and they surely will be in an hour or so from now-will compound that situation. However, we can change that set of circumstances in an hour from now by not supporting the amendment moved by Senator Teague but supporting the motions for disallowance that have been moved by my colleagues Senator Lees and, from Tasmania, Senator Bell.

Indeed, they have approached me in the last few days while I have been in Albury and Shepparton, and two weeks ago when I was on the Eyre Peninsula, with their fears-the disillusionment of non-representation.

        As partners in coalition, National Party senators do not have the opportunity to put up legislation that will determine the circumstances of people in rural Australia; that is coming from the Government. National Party senators frequently support legislation which has created a set of circumstances confronting rural Australia. Today, in an hour from now, National Party senators will have the numbers to scuttle the regulations that put in place the formulas that judge these rural Australians to be asset rich when they are well and truly income poor.

         —Senator Panizza and I both know that these people are not assets rich. It is the formula which judges them to be so. That is the reality. Many of these people have less than a five per cent equity in the assets which are still, by deed, theoretically theirs. In reality, the assets belong to the banks. The banks are the real controllers and owners of the assets. It so happens that, by inappropriate, unjust and distorted formulas, these people are judged to be rich.

        When I was at Tumby Bay the week before last I listened during a public meeting to rural councillors, representatives of the United Farmers and Stockowners of SA Inc. and farmers. They said over and over again that the equity in their properties had fallen to almost nothing. They put in front of me worked examples of figures to prove that the equity in their properties, which had been 80 per cent five years before and 60 per cent three years before, in some cases, is now five per cent or 10 per cent. Yet they are judged to be rich by virtue of the fact that the deeds of those properties happen to be written in their names, even though they have been mortgaged well and truly-and possibly several times over-to enable them to stay on the land and stay in place.

        As I said in a notice of motion in this place upon my return from the Eyre Peninsula, it became crystal clear to me that thousands of rural Australians are moving inexorably into bankruptcy. Their debts have to be restructured by legislation so that they are not forced off their properties. The fact is that the people in this plight are not assets rich and they certainly are not income rich. Some have zero income.

        When visiting women's crisis centres at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula I heard those who administer these crisis centres emphasise the fact that not only is the financial crisis real but also it has now become social, emotional and psychological in its dimensions. The number of women and children seeking refuge from the distress and the agony which Senator Teague cited-he accused us of having compounded it or having created it in some spurious unjust argument which he advanced-is real. It is compounded by these regulations. It is compounded by bureaucrats who ruthlessly apply formulas which arrive at totally inhuman and invalid answers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cite some examples of the outcomes of those formulas. The Isolated Children's Parents Association, to which Senator O'Chee referred repeatedly, in a document prepared by its federal council entitled Access to Education-which is the whole reason for its existence-cited a series of studies, some of which apply to the deprived circumstances in which schoolchildren of rural families find themselves. A number cite quite specifically the circumstances in which tertiary students of rural families find themselves. I cite just two of about eight cases annexed to the document.
       </para>
       <para>
        A case study taken from mid-northern South Australia involves three children in a family undertaking tertiary education: the first is completing an honours degree, the second is in third year university and the third is in the fourth year of university studies. The family has been asked to repay the 1989 and 1990 Austudy amounting to $16,063. Austudy was advanced to and accepted by this family in good faith-frankly, we would argue, and the Opposition would argue, grossly deserved. The family is now being asked to refund $16,000-worth of money which was advanced to it in good faith in accordance with the set of formulas which then applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        The family's assets have been reassessed. The Valuer-General's capital valuations of the property of $516,000 in 1989 and $578,000 in 1990 were used. The Valuer-General's valuations have now been officially reduced by $21,000, due to mistakes in the valuation. However, the Department of Employment, Education and Training did not accept the Valuer-General's figures and the Australian Valuation Office revalued the properties at $735,000, which is almost a 50 per cent increase in the valuation. After review, the figure was reduced to $675,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is in this process of valuation? It is valuing properties which farmers do not own in any real sense. They are in hock to the bank for up to 90 per cent of this valuation figure, yet the bureaucrats play around. There were three sets of figures from three different sources, one of which admits mistakes in the valuation. The whole exercise is irrelevant anyway. The effect of it is to ask the family to give back $16,000-worth of Austudy. Surely, the concept of giving back social service benefits is ludicrous. People with zero income are being asked to give back money that two years ago was advanced to them for the education of their children, based upon a range of valuations which were admitted by the valuers to contain mistakes and upon two valuations which differ in the order of 50 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to a second case study, which is once again from mid-north South Australia, where there are two children undergoing tertiary studies. On the advice of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the farm assets were valued as per council rates notice less the replacement insurance value of the house plus curtilage. That does not mean much to me but that was the formula which was applied. The Commonwealth Valuation Office revalued the property over the limit and all payments had to be repaid within 14 days. They were not advised at the time that they could appeal. Senator Teague has talked about stress and he has blamed us for being responsible for this level of stress.

We have been in these rural areas trying to assist these people in the process of coming to grips with policies that have resulted from the Opposition supporting a government which initiated the legislation. It was put into effect with the Opposition's support, not ours. Time and time again the Opposition sits with the Government to allow the Government to put into effect this sort of legislation. In an hour from now, the Opposition will be confronted with the opportunity to diseffect it but it will not do that. Senator Teague has moved a spurious amendment which the Opposition knows has no effect upon the circumstances of the people who are impacted upon by the regulations which we are attempting to disallow. In the final analysis, when all the rhetoric is over and done with, it is only by disallowing these regulations that we can begin to redress the extraordinary injustices.

        Essentially, it is about equality of opportunity but it is specifically about equality of educational opportunity. By attempting to disallow here, we are addressing the instruments of disequality, namely, regulations. We have no choice. We cannot change the regulations. We can either accept them or reject them. If we reject them we send them back whence they came, to their authors, who can change them. When the authors come forward with a set of regulations which put in place formulas which project justice, then they will find that the Democrats will support them.
       </para>
       <para>
        We disallowed pharmaceutical regulations in this place some months ago and the world has not come to an end. The disallowance of regulations does not bring the world to an end. It sends signals to the Government to bring to an end the gross injustices which in this case deprive rural Australians who are desperate because many of them have no income at all. Most of that I personally would place at the door of greedy banking. Most of these rural Australians now cannot even look forward to passing on to their children the same opportunity to work the land that they themselves have done so effectively for decades.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have before us is an opportunity to do something in support of those people, that is, to redress inequalities of access to education. We therefore call upon at least the National Party senators with conscience to cross the floor today and display the moral courage, which is the only way to reinforce and put substance into the rhetoric that we have heard from the likes of Senator O'Chee.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from Austudy by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Alongside that, I would like to quote from today's Australian the following statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin):
       </para>
       <para>
        Assets tests do not come under consideration in hardship provisions if the property cannot reasonably be expected to be sold or used as security for borrowings.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do that deliberately because there must be consistency across the board in policies and positions. I want to deal with the motion by saying that, in terms of asset testing, I support very strongly the fact that when money is being handed out of the Government purse it should be asset tested. Also, there must be flexibility in how that is done and difficult circumstances must be allowed for. In what Minister Kerin had to say in terms of the asset tests in a different arena, he is allowing flexibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we on this side of the chamber today are putting to the Government is that it should apply that same flexibility in terms of Austudy. In addressing this issue and this debate, I must comment on some of the things that have been said here today, particularly by the Australian Democrats. Unfortunately, once again, the Democrats are being very opportunistic because one must recognise that, when one moves to take away the assets tests or adopt their line, additional finance is required and that has to be collected from somewhere. My colleagues have outlined in their comments on policy positions a number of areas in which this would happen. What I am saying is that, if a free feed is to be given on the one hand, there has to be some mechanism for financing it on the other hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        The very people whom this motion is designed to help, at the bottom line, will be those who are made to suffer the most. This debate is really about rural Australia and those people who are caught up in the rural crisis now. They are price takers because they cannot pass their costs on. Ultimately, additional charges are passed right down the line. That is the distinction between the position that we are adopting and the position that the Democrats are adopting.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am rather disappointed that Senator McLean left the chamber so quickly after speaking, because I found his comments in regard to Senator O'Chee, when he talked about hot air, rather remarkable. We have to listen to Senator McLean on a whole range of issues night after night, speech after speech, when the smoke is coming out of his nostrils and the steam is coming out of his ears, yet he gets up and accuses one of my colleagues of speaking hot air.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at some of the facts surrounding this debate. The recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics survey results indicate that about 50 per cent of farms have net assets worth in excess of $695,000. They also indicate that somewhere between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of those who do not have the required level of net assets are receiving Austudy. The problem we have is that there is too much variability with an assets test applying to farmland. Senator Teague referred to that and I will expand on it.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is considerable volatility in valuations. Australia has valuation procedures. There is a commercial valuation and a stress valuation. I know what Minister Kerin meant when he used the term `cannot reasonably be expected to be sold or used as security for borrowings'. It is important to understand just what stress valuation means and how it works in terms of commercial valuation. When a bank assesses what an individual can borrow, it generally takes 50 per cent of the stress value as the benchmark. In reasonable times, or good times, the stress value is normally considered to be two-thirds of the commercial value. In tough times such as we have now, it can drop to 40 or 50 per cent of commercial value, which means that the capacity to borrow against that asset is reduced very significantly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to cite some figures at this time to emphasise how important it is for the Government to show consistency in its policy, just as we are showing consistency in our position. The Government is showing consistency when it says that government assistance should be subject to an assets test. For the sake of easy sums, I will round off the $695,000 which is allowed now to $700,000. In good times, the stress value would be $462,000 and the farmer or the small country business can borrow up to $231,000 against it. In bad times such as we have now, the stress value reduces from $462,000 to $350,000 or less, which means-taking 50 per cent against that-that someone can borrow only up to $175,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        So in terms of what are relatively short term requirements for education, the capacity to borrow against that asset is reduced significantly. In addition, irrespective of whether we are in good, bad or other times, it is impossible to sell the back paddock or the front paddock and it is impossible for the small business in the town to sell off one of the rooms of its garages, one of its showrooms or parts of the yard. That is not a practical proposition.

         —I will come to that in a minute. We are addressing a way of overcoming the problem, not carrying on with a lot of hot air-to quote somebody in this chamber today-or trying to score political points in the country by putting forward erroneous arguments. We are trying to work out a method by which the problem can be addressed, which we can put to the Government. On top of that, the levels of borrowings that might apply against a property or business at a particular time impact very differently. If a person has an asset valued at around $695,000, with no debt, that person is in a very different position from a person having an asset worth, say, $1m with $400,000 or $500,000 debt against it. We cannot have these things fixed so hard that there is no flexibility left. That is what we are talking about today. This is what our argument is about. We are asking the Government to be consistent by allowing the same flexibility with Austudy as it has allowed in other areas. That would be the mechanism by which we could address this problem.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I emphasise that aspect of the issue because we are not talking about something out in the field, or in the country, which is rigid. Yet we have a set of rules in front of us which are absolutely rigid and which do not allow a practical way of overcoming the problem. At the bottom line, I am sure all of us in this chamber would want the very people we are talking about-that is, students-to have the opportunity of equal access to education. In this debate we are dealing with a group that is disadvantaged by geography or the tyranny of distance. That has been mentioned already today. That tyranny of distance varies from student to student or from position to position. That is why we say that it is important to introduce a mechanism which allows flexibility in dealing with the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        Looking at the overall contribution from recurrent expenditure on higher education, it is worth noting that currently the contribution rate is running at about 19 per cent. If we compare that figure with those of other countries, we find that in France the rate is 9.2 per cent; in Italy it is 2.9 per cent; in Japan it is 0.5 per cent; in the Netherlands it is 10.1 per cent; in the United States of America it is 8.4 per cent; and in the United Kingdom it is 20.3 per cent. The figure for Australia is sitting at 19.3 per cent and only one country actually has a higher rate. When we compare the contribution rate for Australian students with the contribution rate of other countries, we find that we are up there with the best.
       </para>
       <para>
        Returning to what I said earlier, I emphasise that we are looking to introduce a mechanism which will allow flexibility in stressful times, when valuations have an enormous impact on the capacity of an operation, a property or a business to borrow or sell, and where there is genuine hardship.

         —I rise to make several points, particularly about matters which have been raised by members of the Opposition. In debates such as this it is important to remind the chamber exactly what we are dealing with. We are dealing with regulations which substantially modify the Austudy provisions in that they reduce the amounts which are available by altering various aspects of the means test and requirements which have to be fulfilled before one qualifies for Austudy. The regulations substantially increase the inequity in relation to applicability of Austudy because of those changes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As several of my colleagues have pointed out, in dealing with regulations we do not have the option under the procedures in this place to amend regulations. We must either accept those regulations or disallow them. The motion before us, moved by my Australian Democrats colleague Senator Bell, is to disallow certain of those regulations. Senator Bell has set out the particular regulations and the reasons why those regulations are repugnant to the Democrats. The other part of the process that we are going through this afternoon is one which we have gone through very often in this place, in that we have seen speaker after speaker from the Opposition telling us how inequitable a particular set of regulations or a certain piece of legislation is. Then, having waxed lyrical, having become angry, having had, to use Senator Crane's words, fire emerging from the nostrils and steam from the ears, the Opposition then turns around and votes with the Government and supports the piece of legislation or the regulations in question.
       </para>
       <para>
        That, of course, is precisely what we have this afternoon. We have heard many cogent reasons from the Opposition as to why these regulations should be disallowed and why the Government should be forced to go back and look at them again, to come up with different regulations. We have had specific examples of the way in which particular aspects of these regulations impact adversely on sections of the community, especially the rural community. However, I would point out that, while that section of the community is one which has been particularly adversely affected at this time, our primary concern in disallowing these regulations is the general principle of inequity. It just happens that at this time the rural community is particularly hard hit and, therefore, the aspect of inequity is adversely affecting it more than perhaps many others. But the inequity also relates to many people in the urban community. It is the inequity and the lack of adequate provision for help which is affecting us.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition, having given good examples of the impact which these regulations will have on many disadvantaged people, will nonetheless at the end of the day vote with the Government for the passage of these regulations. Is it that Opposition members now have their eye on the next election and are quite happy to keep in place some disastrously iniquitous regulations because it will advantage them when the next election comes along? They will be able to turn to the speeches they have made this afternoon and quite dishonestly say `Look, this is what we said at the time'. They will ignore the fact that they voted for these regulations and the impact of those regulations on the general public at that time will, they hope, advantage them in electoral terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        I venture to suggest that the procedure we are seeing this afternoon is as dishonest as that. They are prepared to impose regulations which, by their own words, they recognise as bad, harsh and inequitable. They are prepared to impose those regulations on the community simply to gain an electoral advantage when the next election comes along.

        This afternoon we have heard from the Opposition several quite incompatible assertions. We heard from Senator Teague that the Democrats were supporting a change in regulations which would impose further financial constraints on the Government. `Where is the money coming from?', he asked rhetorically, and gave no answer. That was a constant theme throughout the speech. Yet, when Senator O'Chee spoke, he was full of all sorts of places where he thought the Democrats or the Government would get money.

Death duties was one of the things that were hoarily trotted out. Death duties is not-and I repeat not-part of Democrat policy. It is absolutely dishonest of Opposition members to claim either in this place or outside, as they have, that death duties are part of our policy.

We are quite happy to stand by our policy, and we set out in our alternative Budget last year precisely not only where the amount of money would come from to meet the Government's proposed excess but also a great deal more than that, and we set that out in great detail. So to claim things other than that is simply quite dishonest of the Opposition.

        I return to the process that we are going through this afternoon. I said earlier that the mechanisms allowable in this place are simply the passage or the disallowance of regulations. In fairly recent times we have had an example of the way in which disallowance of regulations works to the reasonably rapid advantage of the passage of very much improved regulations. I refer here to the passage of the therapeutic goods regulations. Not unlike the Austudy legislation, as Senator Teague pointed out, that is a simple enabling piece of legislation and the guts of the action, as it were, comes out of the detail, which is found in regulations .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Therapeutic Goods Act was essentially the same-a very simple Act, and the guts of the action which was to be taken under that Act is to be found in the regulations. When those regulations first came before the Senate, the Democrats moved for their disallowance. In other words, that Act could not operate until those regulations were in place. That was supported by the Opposition. We then went into an extensive period of consultation and negotiation with the Government which eventually, after six or seven months, saw the passage of regulations which were substantially different from the regulations which were first put before the Senate, with substantial improvement to the operation of those regulations and indeed with almost unanimous support from those in the community who were concerned about those regulations in the first instance. That is the sort of thing that we would hope for in relation to these regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are indeed existing regulations in place. The regulations now before us are to replace certain of those regulations. The regulations now before us, as Senator Bell has gone through in considerable detail, both decrease the availability of Austudy and make it less equitable in its application. I recap several of the regulations which Senator Bell ran through. In South Australia-and I should imagine the situation is somewhat similar in other States-we have in the Elder Conservatorium of Music in Adelaide an institution which has always taken gifted students at much earlier ages than the age at which students would normally matriculate, because music is one of those gifts in which very often children at a very young age are able to advance much more quickly than the average. We have seen students far below the age of matriculation attending the Conservatorium and doing advanced studies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mathematics is another area where peculiarly gifted children are able to advance at a very rapid rate. We have recently seen the case of a student engaged in mathematics to the level of graduating from university at the age of 14. The adherence to a particular age-the age of 16-as Senator Bell has pointed out, very severely discriminates against those gifted children who may come from disadvantaged families. Children coming from well-off families-families which can afford to allow them to advance if they are gifted-will succeed, but this country is probably missing out on the talents of a great number of students who, through no fault of their own, simply have come from families which do not have the wherewithal to allow them to advance at the rate at which they may otherwise do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bell also went through the various criteria in relation to the size of incomes; the students; and the students' supporting parents, quasi supporting parents, step-parents if they happen to have them, and their spouses, if they happen to be married. In every instance, these regulations make the provision of help to students more difficult and less equitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        On frequent occasions we have heard from the lips of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) the term `clever country'. My response to that term, when I first heard it and certainly as I hear it now from the Prime Minister, is that we need cleverness in this country not in the area of the ordinary community but in the Parliament of this nation. What we need far more than cleverness is wisdom. One needs look no further than these regulations to see the lack of wisdom exhibited by this Government. It is not wise to cut off at source those students who wish desperately to go on with tertiary education, but who are made incapable of progressing through that education simply because this Government progressively decreases the support to those students. It is not particularly wise; it is certainly not particularly clever.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am desperately worried that 15 to 20 years down the track, if we continue to pursue the course that we have in recent years, not only will we be a banana republic but also we will be in desperate straits. There will not be the educated talent around to make this the interesting, vital and creative country that it should be. It is for those general reasons that I find these particular regulations quite repugnant. Therefore, I believe that they should be disallowed.

         —What we have seen this afternoon is very much a battle of popularism-one that appeals very much to the electorate but, I think, reflects a fair degree of fiscal irresponsibility. The degree of financial anarchy which has been shown by my good friend Senator Bell this afternoon in the way he has approached this matter is one which we ought to take into account when we are assessing the debate that has gone on this afternoon.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Anyone listening to the debate would have thought that the Government has ignored students and that care and sensitivity are on the other side of the Parliament, only-whether it is the Australian Democrats, the Liberal Party of Australia or the National Party of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a competition going on to see who can best represent the views of the electorate but, when one looks at that, the basic position from which to start is the record. When one looks at the record in terms of assistance to families with students in education, one sees a totally different picture emerging. It is very easy to come in here, as the Democrats have this afternoon, and give us a shopping bill of $1.2 billion by way of amendments to the regulations. It is very easy to make all sorts of comments supporting mechanisms and allowances here, there and everywhere. One really has to start with the record and the sorts of cutbacks, or areas, that one would look at in terms of priorities, if one were to adopt some of the proposals put forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have mentioned, family payments under this Government have been indexed in such a way that maintains their real value and costs revenue $1.5 billion a year. It is not a small piece of the cake, it is a substantial amount, and I think it is one of the great achievements of this Government. Those payments go very much to the heart of assisting families in the sorts of situations that have been mentioned this afternoon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look directly at student assistance and the most immediate record; let us look at some of the indicators; let us look at some of the most recent history; and by doing that, let us reflect on the sorts of comments that have been made this afternoon. In terms of the number of students who get assistance from government, in 1983-under whatever schemes were in operation at the time-just over 150,000 students received government assistance to go through education. In 1990-the last year for which we have figures-that figure had increased to 353,000. In 1983 it was 30 per cent of the student population, in 1990 it was 40 per cent. There has been a 33 per cent increase in the number of students receiving assistance under this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        That assistance has not been given without an allocation of further funds. Over the last financial year, for instance, funds under Austudy have increased from $823m to $965m-double the rate of the inflation increase over that period. When one also looks at the number of students receiving assistance from government over that period, there is an increase from 319,000 to 353,000. Once again, that is a substantial increase over a period of 12 months. Achievements have been made and there have been increases in expenditure in all these areas. In recognising the achievements and placing them on the record, it is important to note that the Government still ploughs on with policy development in this particular area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another indicator is the retention rates. Whereas in 1987, when Austudy was introduced, 53 per cent of the student population stayed through the education process, in 1990-once again, the latest figures that we have available-that figure went up to 64 per cent. That is an important increase over that short period of time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regarding the sorts of people who are getting assistance to go through education, the most disadvantaged 20 per cent of the population is that which is doing year 12. Over the period 1986-1989 there was a 5 per cent increase each year of those from that part of the population who received government assistance and stayed on through the schooling process.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very easy to come in here and do what has been done this afternoon, but one really needs to take an overall perspective of this area, and recognise that this is probably the only government that has actually tackled this area in an honest way. One should also recognise that it has only been in recent months that we have realised that Austudy needs to be reviewed, and a review is going on. That is pretty well known to the Senate and it is pretty well known to the student population.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to honourable senators opposite that it is pretty irresponsible to come in here and come up with a billion dollar package-as has been done by the Democrats-present that to the student population and raise expectations that these sorts of spending levels can be achieved. The student population understands that they cannot: the Australian Democrats are dealing with a population which has a few clues and can see through them. I do not think the Democrats are doing themselves or the community any service by raising false expectations in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to Senator Bell's points. His disallowance motion would preclude the payment of Austudy to any student. The reality is that the previous regulations have been withdrawn and rescinded; that was done earlier this year. If the regulations that are the subject of the debate today do not go through, no regulations will apply. Moreover, if some of the changes that Senator Bell proposes were to go through, we would have enormous costing to revenue. I said $1.2 billion; in a few seconds I will go back to explain how that figure is actually arrived at.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of Senator Lees's proposals on the assets tests, her colleague has done her a disservice. She probably ran on this issue for a while in South Australia and in other areas. The whole area has really been generalised so much that the focus of what she is on about has been missed in this debate, not only in terms of the points that she wants to make but also in terms of the points that the Government would want to make.
       </para>
       <para>
        For instance, those interested in the plight of farmers-and the farmers have had a fair mention this afternoon-should realise that they already have an assets cut-off which is double the normal assets cut-off point; it is $695,000 instead of $347,500. The Government has already relinquished the 1990 Budget decision to reduce the assets cut-off point to $200,000 and $400,000 for farmers. The Opposition should realise that we are responding in that area in a way that is a cost to revenue. It should also realise that we do not have the $1.2 billion to go around.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a shaking of the odd head by some on the Opposition benches in terms of the $1.2 billion. But let me look at a couple of areas of Senator Bell's--

         —Before Senator Teague came in here I made the point that there has been a bit of political point-scoring this afternoon due to this populism that seems to emanate on broadcast day. The figure that I have is $1.2 billion. I do not know whether it is one that Senator Teague has developed, but I am assured that it is one that comes from the Department of Employment, Education and Training rather than one that has been developed in any political office. That is an assurance I have just had confirmed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If, for instance, one looks at the amendment to regulation 68-the independent age provision-one finds that the proposal is to abolish parental income tests for students aged 18 and over. As we know, it currently applies to students aged 25 and over. I am advised that the cost of that proposal would be $700m. That in itself is halfway towards the $1.2 billion that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, we realise that we cannot amend regulations, but a pure disallowance of this regulation would remove the concession for students aged 25 and over, and that would just throw the whole scheme into disarray.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of another big ticket item, I turn to regulation 88-the threshold for parental income tests. As we know, the proposal is one that really cannot be pursued because the Senate does not have the power to amend regulations at this stage. The proposal is to increase the threshold of the parental income test with no new level proposed. The cost of raising the threshold to average earnings, as Senator Bell appears to propose, is $300m. I am advised, not by a political office but by the Department, that those two items would mean $1 billion expenditure. As I said, that is Senator Bell's proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees targets the assets test. One needs to take into account the Government's position, which it has stressed quite clearly. One actually has to ask oneself: in an area where it is contended by the Democrats that money can be found, what would actually happen if the funding in this particular area were targeted by removal of the income test? What would happen is that those who are most in need would have to share this part of the cake with those who are less in need. That would really do a great disservice to those in the community who are most in need when going through schooling and education.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees has to take into account that, as I said earlier, we do have special provision for farmers in small business. The effect on farmers is reduced by the 50 per cent discounting for family businesses. There is also the isolated secondary students allowance for those students over 16 who need to live away from home. In those cases an allowance of $1,500 a year is payable free from the income assets test under the assistance for isolated children scheme. In addition, we should recognise that rural families also benefit from the country areas program, increased funding for school student hostels and improved access to higher education provided by assistance education centres.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a mechanism in the scheme as it now operates to take into account the assets at the time of payment. Parents can ask to be reassessed if the market value of their assets falls during the year. Anyone who has taken an interest in this scheme understands that. That provides a very useful mechanism in times when prices are falling. When looking at assets in this area, one should also take into account that we are looking at the net market value of assets. We are excluding the value of the family home and the value of debts on those assets. As I said earlier, it applies to only 50 per cent of the value of assets if a person works a family business. For instance, with the 50 per cent discount, the amount is $695,000 for parents with combined assets. It is a fairly big amount. Having said that, I would be the last to state that there are no problems in the scheme. As I say, the Government has already picked up that issue and is conducting a review to that extent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sorts of proposals that we have had this afternoon are populist. They are very unfair and they are misleading to the client community. When addressing this debate honourable senators should recognise that enormous inroads have already been made. I mentioned them earlier in terms of retention rates, moneys spent and concessions that the Government has made in relation to, for instance, the assets test. But one really cannot come in here with proposals that would cost $1.2 billion, that have not been worked out in their detail, that really should go before a continuing review and that raise false expectations in a community, particularly amongst those who, in some respects, are quite desperate to have those expectations raised. Those people are led on in a way that they should not be. The Government opposes the disallowance motions moved by the Democrats and does not support the amendment moved by Senator Teague.

       <para>
        The Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from AUSTUDY by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the Government that, at the present time, its policies do not adequately take into account the hardship that is being suffered in so many rural areas. There are country towns at present which have just about collapsed completely. There is no money changing hands and there is genuine hardship in the rural communities and among the townspeople who, as a result of the rural recession, are not getting any money, are not able to survive and whose children will be seriously disadvantaged by the situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) referred to the Government's aim to increase retention at the secondary school level. All of us agree that that is a commendable aim. We have heard so often in recent years the Government boasting of the increase in retention levels. If increasing retention rates is to be an aim and something which is promoted as being very important to the education system, it is important that children who live in the country are not disadvantaged, that they have an equal opportunity of being retained to year 12 and are not merely discarded and thrown on the scrap heap. Many people at present are not able to offer their children the education that they would have hoped. They are not even able to put them in a neighbouring town or pay the boarding fees that would be necessary for them to live in a town nearby and go to a high school. That is something that we cannot allow to continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some comments really need to be made about the motions that are before us today. Senator Lees's motion effectively abolishes the assets test. There has been discussion as to additional cost that would result.
       </para>
       <para>
        If that money were to be made available, there are other ways in which it needs to be spent in the areas of education and health. It should not be spent on making Austudy a universal right of all students. That is the outcome that we believe should come out of this.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees's motion does not really target rural and country students but targets all students. Some city students may be suffering hardship as well, but I believe they are able to be more easily catered for than are country students at the present time. I do not believe city students would be forced to give up their education in the same way that students from country towns and rural areas would be. While I do not suggest for a minute that Senator Lees is not sincere in what she is aiming to do, I believe that she is not going about it in a way which will benefit those people in the country areas who need help most.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bell's motion seeks to disallow about eight of the regulations. That would have an incredible impact. It seems to me that removing the age limit on Austudy to make it available for students of all ages may then make Austudy available to students who, while they certainly want to pursue an education, are not necessarily those who ought to be included in the target group. If Austudy were made virtually meaningless by leaving no rate for Austudy benefits, one can only conjecture what the impact would be. Perhaps it would mean that nobody would get anything or perhaps the Minister would be able to determine from time to time what the rate would be.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have thought that removing the special rate for the special living allowance is particularly relevant to the rural people whom the Australian Democrats say that they are attempting to assist. The Democrats also suggest making the independent rate available to younger students who fulfil the other criteria and making the independent rate available to students who are engaged in--

        Regulation 85 defines `parents' for the purpose of the income test, abolishing the parental income test and abolishing the spouse income test. Obviously, only limited money is available. I believe there is no possibility at the present time of this country being able to afford the money for Austudy that the Democrats would like. When one is not in government I guess it is easy to put forward a proposition which extends Austudy in this way and to say to people what one would like to be able to do if one was in government and if the country could afford it.

        The most important thing for us at the present time is to see students, who would otherwise be deprived of education, getting access to the sort of money which may assist them in being able to stay at school. The long term benefit to them and to the country hardly needs to be spelled out.
       </para>

        We take the view that a number of aspects of Austudy need to be reviewed and we will do that when we are in government. We will review the administration of Austudy in order to overcome the administrative deficiencies and the allegations which we have all heard. One cannot go to a party anywhere without hearing about somebody getting Austudy who everybody else feels ought not to be getting it. Clearly, there needs to be a review in this area-either of the administration or of the way in which Austudy is made available-to see that some of these things do not occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will see that there is a realistic assets test for Austudy which includes a hardship provision. I think we all need to recognise that hardship is something which occurs here and there from time to time. It can occur in a place such as Newcastle where, if there is an earthquake, there may be a need for specific hardship provisions for a period of time. The whole aim of social security, welfare payments, Austudy and things of this nature ought to be to assist people during times of hardship-during periods in people's lives when they need support and assistance for varying periods of time. There may be occasions when assistance needs to be applied in one part of Australia and not in another. But one has to be sufficiently imaginative to see that the benefit is given to those who need it.

        We will certainly look at the isolated children's scheme. I have been quite appalled at the way that that has been handled in recent years. I feel that this Government has no understanding whatsoever of the plight of isolated children, as is seen by the way it has dealt with them. I think it is a great pity that those who live in areas where they do not have the same opportunities as city children are not being given the opportunity to pursue their education. There are other areas where isolated children have come to be disadvantaged during this period of the Labor Government. Fairness and equity are needed in these matters. We cannot indulge ourselves with expensive schemes which the Democrats-no doubt quite sincerely-would like to see.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not possible to make something like Austudy universal. I think most people in the community feel that it is of benefit and should be available. Students must get assistance, but not in a way which can be abused and which could see some students receiving it who ought not to be and others who live in the country towns and rural areas being deprived of education because of the circumstances of the economy at the present time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nobody is suggesting that Austudy should continue forever, but right now I think we all recognise that there are people in country areas who are not surviving. These people may have properties which, notionally, appear to be extremely valuable, but one test is to try to find a buyer for one of them. One of my colleagues mentioned earlier being told by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to sell part of a property. Who will buy part of it? It is absolute nonsense and it indicates to me that some people who are involved in this area have very little comprehension as to what life in the country is like and the state in which people are left when there is absolutely no value in a property.
       </para>
       <para>
        A property which in the 1950s wool boom-that was 40-odd years ago-was extremely valuable may not be so valuable any more. Australia's mineral and rural exports are no longer bringing in the sort of money that they once did. But there are people in this country who still feel that if people live 50-odd miles out of town they are wealthy. That is not the case any more and anyone who has relatives living in the country, or who represents a rural electorate, knows what it is like to live in very difficult circumstances.

        The last thing we want is to see the next generation of young people from the country disadvantaged by not being able to get an education. We need to see that those who need this money actually get it. I commend the motion that has been moved by Senator Teague. The Government should take an urgent and new look at the concept of hardship to see that its aim of having an increased number of students staying at school until at least year 12 in fact has some reality for those people who live outside the city areas.

However, I heard Senator Reid and Senator Teague and, of course, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus)-who, unfortunately, has now left the chamber-ask the question very loudly and very insistently, `But where is the money coming from?'. That question falls into my area of interest and I thought it would be useful to remind the Minister, in particular, but also honourable senators on the Opposition side, that it is in fact a matter of political will and that money can be obtained, provided that we have priorities which extend to providing access to Austudy for people and, therefore, access to education.

        How will we become the clever country if we stop people from taking advantage of our educational facilities and instead refuse to raise $1,100m by increasing the excise on tobacco and alcohol by 40 per cent? This item-I am glad to see that the Minister has re-entered the chamber-was contained in the Australian Democrats' alternative Budget. The Government could have picked it up, knowing full well that the Democrats would have supported it if the Government had chosen to get $1,100m.

         —Just before the dinner recess, I was suggesting to the Minister, who was in the chamber, that he really could choose to use some political will and tax alcohol and tobacco an additional 40 per cent, which would yield $1.1 billion.

        Another item in our alternative Budget suggests that a Commonwealth land tax of one per cent should be levied on the improved value of land held by absentee foreign land owners. The tax will not apply to principal residences of non-resident Australian citizens. I notice that the Australian Registered Cattle Breeders Association recently asked that the Foreign Investment Review Board provisions be amended to ensure that our land cannot be bought up willy-nilly by foreign landowners. That Association and honourable senators on my right-and I use the term advisedly-should therefore support that particular suggestion.

        Together, those items would give us $1.2 billion, an amount which, of course, Senator Bell's suggestion does not really need for it to be fulfilled. That is the absolute maximum that could be used if every step was taken and every offer was taken up, but it is unlikely that that would be so, and the reason will be outlined in a minute by Senator Bell. But the money is there if the political will is there on the Government and Opposition sides. Once again, it is quite clear that the Government would not be able to implement its policies if it were not aided and abetted by the Opposition, which is quite gleeful watching the conservative policies--

        Again, there is a choice of a number of items that the Government could pick up-in fact could have picked up-because we offered a couple of items as amendments and the Government rejected them. Let me name one. The depreciation allowed as a tax deduction on luxury cars does not apply to lease payments on an identical motor vehicle. I believe that that is a loophole which the Government could close at any time and raise revenue of $20m.

        Since that may not be quite enough, we could look at the anti-tax avoidance provisions-part 4a of the income tax legislation-which currently do not apply to withholding taxes, foreign tax credits and rebates. I offered that amendment to the Government recently, and both the Government and the Opposition decided not to pick it up.

        The other item which could be considered, for good measure, is to deny tax deductibility for Australian organisations holding their annual conferences in Hawaii, Tahiti or Acapulco. This would raise another $5m. So the money is there.

        I think Senator Reid and others, in saying that these measures that would increase access to our education system for thousands of people could not be implemented, are wrong.

         —I will be brief, but let me observe simply this: essentially, the assets test is an equitable criterion when considering taxation measures as distinct from equity and opportunity costs. The great tragedy of this debate is the very necessity for it, the very fact that there is a need presently to consider the income of the rural sector. The truth of the matter is that levels of assets for a great many rural producers are totally irrelevant in terms of the economic well-being of the producers or of their disposable incomes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There has been a dramatic collapse in rural incomes and commodity prices. This year farmers' incomes are expected to decline by 67 per cent. According to the National Farmers Federation, the average farm income is expected to be $20,614, and, for wheat farmers, $3,875. It has reached the stage in parts of Western Australia-and I suspect that this is true of other parts of Australia-where finance companies are actually visiting farms and stations and physically collecting the cheque books. A pastoralist will be left on his station with no other source, no other capacity, to pay for his daily needs or to maintain the ongoing activity of his farm. Elders Finance or whichever company takes the cheque book and says, `This is the most painless way that we can ensure that you do not damage yourself or us for the future', is simply cutting the umbilical, simply cutting the capacity to function.
       </para>
       <para>
        In many respects commodity prices are outside the control of Australian producers. It may well be said that wheat prices are likely to rebound in the next year or two and that this year is an aberration, although that cannot be said of wool prices. They will be depressed for the medium to long term. But what this Government does have control over, what this Government does have a capacity to influence, is the free on board cost of goods. In other words, it has the capacity to influence net profits as distinct from gross profits. It has control over interest rates, inflation, transport costs, unit labour costs and waterfront costs, yet thus far it has done absolutely nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) is in the chamber. In the case of waterfront reform, we are seeing a repetition of what we saw immediately following containerisation of the waterfront. The number of employees was reduced. There was a surplus to demand, a surplus to need of labour, but during that period the income of waterside workers went up dramatically. When we are supposed to be having reform in order to get rid of the bizarre practices, the bizarre rip-offs and the bizarre costs on the waterfront, the price of reform has been blackmail.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) dashed down in his jet from sunny Northern Territory to take Senator Collins by the hand and finally negotiate a blackmail deal which, in essence, says, `If you make some modest gains so that on 6 May I look good, we will ensure that you have a substantially improved income for the following 12 months'. In other words, the price for doing the obvious, natural, reasonable thing was to set the waterside workers aside from everybody else, to be subject to blackmail and to give them substantial benefits simply for doing the right thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end of the day, efficiency on the waterfront will still be dragging way behind that of the rest of the world. Then we have transport costs other than the waterfront. We can go into the costs of shipping, even down to New Zealand, of course. Senator Collins has not yet addressed that; he has not told us what he intends to do about the cosy deal between the Waterside Workers Federation and the seamen's unions of Australia and New Zealand, and the bizarre practices that are carried on.

         —Let me tell Senator Lees what it has to do with Austudy. It has to do with the cost and the capacity of the rural sector to pay its own way. The reason the Australian Democrats are now trying to make cheap political points arises from the dire circumstances in which the rural economy finds itself. Not only has its assets collapsed, but so has its net income each year. Presumably, that is why Senator Lees is arguing for the disallowance in the way she is, because of the incapacity of the rural sector to pay. I am setting out some areas that are within the influence and capacity of the Government to put right. The tragedy is that we are arguing about a smaller and reduced cake. We are in the gutter arguing about social welfare needs because this Government has destroyed the economy. We would not be here debating this issue if the economy were set in the right direction. It is absurd not to look at the macro-economic considerations. I turn to unit labour costs, for instance. Between 1983 and 1990 those costs have risen--

We want to know why farmers, people in the rural sector and in the rural community and country towns, are in their present dire circumstances, when the costs of labour in Australia are double the figure anywhere else. One wonders why interest rates are where they are. In notional terms they have come down four or five points in the past few months, but in real terms interest rates in Australia are holding high. Why are they holding high? It is because of the fragility of the Australian dollar, combined with the level of inflation.

        Having said that, I thoroughly support Senator Teague's amendment to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from Austudy by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds. The tragedy is that that statistic is already moving. There are already a great many parents who are required to withdraw their children from a college education in the metropolitan area simply because they cannot afford to feed them in the schools-they cannot afford to pay the bills. Those children are being required to go back home and have some sort of extended education program that puts them at a significant disadvantage compared with those people who live in the metropolitan areas. If it were not for the economic circumstances cast on this community like a great depressing cloud, we would not be required to debate the circumstances as we are. But to the extent that we are debating this matter, I support Senator Teague's amendment without qualification.

Therefore, the parties in this chamber at least realise that Austudy as it operates at present is simply chaotic. If reports in the Sunday Age are accurate-and I certainly hope they are-it appears that at last the Government has recognised that this is a major problem area. But it is obvious that we all have very different ways of expressing what needs to be done to overcome the problems with Austudy. The Government is proposing a review which will be completed by, it anticipates, September this year. However, I make the point that that is too late for those in rural Australia. They need help now, not next year.

        Austudy was developed for all the right reasons but, as time has shown, the wrong practical emphasis has applied. There are loopholes big enough to drive a bus through. From the number of fraudulent claims that the Austudy section of the Department of Employment, Education and Training spends its time unravelling, it seems that the loopholes are not just huge but also easy to find by anyone wishing to rort the system. For example, I want to read to the Senate a copy of a letter I received from a deputy principal of a school, highlighting the inadequacies of the system and to indicate how some people are rorting the system. It gives the reason why we should not be proceeding down the track that Senator Lees is currently proposing to the Senate. The letter states:

        Dear Sir,

       <para>
        Jane D-
       </para>
       <para>
        and I will use that expression to describe the person-
       </para>
       <para>
        was an enrolled student at this school in 1990, and was processed as a leaver on 30 November.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 4 February 1991 she reappeared, saying that she wished to re-enrol. She was given the appropriate forms, and was entered on our roll. She told us that her start would be delayed by medical treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        After several weeks during which she did not attend we heard reports that led us to ask if she intended to be a student. When she replied in the negative, her name was removed from our roll as of 1 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        Jane D thus was on our roll for four weeks in 1991, but as she did not attend school we cannot say that she has been a student this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        We leave the decision to you as to whether you wish to recoup money she has received.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we had learned earlier that she was claiming Austudy, we would have investigated her non-attendance more vigilantly. Unfortunately, we are not notified until the end of term, by which time a fraudulent applicant could have received a large sum of money difficult to recoup.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it possible for Austudy to verify a claim earlier in the process, before paying so much money to the applicant?
       </para>
       <para>
        That letter, as addressed to the Department of Employment, Education and Training in South Australia, highlighted a problem in the system, how the system is open to abuse, and why we should not be proceeding down the path proposed by Senator Lees.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time as the loopholes are embracing the unworthy, to which I have just referred, the regulations are shutting out some sections of the extremely needy in the community. In my State, specifically in the rural sector, many families which have book assets of land and machinery that they cannot sell have been deemed to be too asset-rich to access Austudy. It is a cruel situation that should be redressed, for while these families may indeed have assets on paper they cannot in fact be realised. Nor can they even be borrowed against, because those families are earning little or no income during the present troubles in rural areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one does not have an income one cannot get a loan, and I do not need to emphasise to the Senate that the banks have retreated into very conservative lending practices, given their experiences in the 1980s. Farmers cannot obtain carry-on funds, as their assets have depreciated substantially over the past year or two. So they have no asset value on which to secure a loan and they have no income with which to repay the loan, and therefore they cannot access a loan. It is a vicious catch 22 cycle that these people in rural Australia and rural South Australia are caught in. In other words, I suppose, they have assets which in these economic times are quite worthless, except when it comes to claiming government help such as Austudy, and then those assets are deemed to be a reason for excluding support, when that support ought to be forthcoming.
       </para>
       <para>
        It saddens me that, while there is a genuine problem with Austudy regulations, which we must overcome if Austudy is to be fairly and properly doing the job which it was meant to do and which it was developed for, we have to understand that that is not why we have these motions before the Senate. The Democrats' motion to abolish the assets test is a grab for publicity back home in South Australia and elsewhere in rural Australia. Senator Lees has been putting the Democrats' view and creating false hopes on the part of farming families who are already greatly distressed by the rural crisis. They are false hopes, and Senator Lees knows it. They have been told that it is only the Democrats who will get rid of the Austudy assets test so that the asset rich but income poor families may qualify.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, Senator Lees never actually mentioned that the Democrats did not vote against the introduction of the assets test in the first place, nor, while we are talking about the Democrats engendering false hopes, has she told those families that her Party's policy is to apply death duties on all properties over $300,000 in value, that her Party supports a capital gains tax and a Federal land tax, and that it intends to cut funds to non-government schools. It certainly would not take a wool or wheat crisis or a drought to ruin Australia's rural areas-just a few months of Democrat policies would do that quite successfully.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past months, I have witnessed a considerable amount of concern and dejection amongst rural people as to the sort of direction and promises put forward and, more importantly, I think, the false hopes that have been created for these people in rural Australia. Unlike the Democrats, who promise the world but know that they will never be in a position where they actually have to deliver it, we believe in our policies being responsible. I hope that Senator Lees will not do a quick clip of today's Hansard and splash the debate around the South Australian countryside in an attempt to set the perception that she is the only person in Federal Parliament who will take action to help people in the rural sector to access Austudy. To do so would be absolutely hypocritical. It would be hypocritical because even a fleeting glance at the motion indicates that it is not real. The matter has not been researched thoroughly.
       </para>
       <para>
        If Senator Lees actually meant there to be serious debate in this chamber on such a motion, she would at least have narrowed it down to removing the assets test only for the rural families in need. But, no, as the motion stands, Senator Lees wants to open the Austudy floodgates to wide abuse. I have referred to one abuse already. Her motion, if passed, would have meant no assets test on Austudy for anyone, anywhere: none for the city or country people, regardless of economic circumstances. That, to me, is opportunism. A school student could tell Senator Lees that abolition of the assets test would only worsen Austudy's unfairness, for it is obvious that the rich who live on assets would benefit. If abolished it would cost the country another $60m minimum a year, and I am told that that is a conservative figure, not allowing for the abuse factor that might apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where would the money come from? Who on another social welfare program suffers to allow this suggestion of the Democrats to proceed? It would weaken the targeting of Austudy to those in need, as thousands more families who most definitely do not need help and yet meet the Democrats' criteria put their hands out. It would allow further misdirection of funds. As I have said already, it is opening the floodgates to abuse.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the rural sector needs help at present, and in the present rural crisis incomes have been drastically reduced. In many cases producers can expect negative incomes this year. Their assets are not an indication of their income earning capacity, and special provisions are appropriate at this time. My colleague Senator Teague and other speakers have referred to the hardship provisions that need to be put in place at this time without opening the floodgates to abuse.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a need to ensure that country people access higher levels of education. If one looks at the participation rates in higher education per head of population, one will find variations according to region, those figures being highest for people in urban areas, lower for those in rural areas and lower still for people in remote areas. Those results have occurred as a result of relating the figures to a population base. The basic hierarchy is similar for all age groups, both sexes and across all States. In other words, we are not ensuring that country people and people who live in remote areas have the same access to education as their city counterparts.
       </para>
       <para>
        For that reason, we need properly targeted support and assistance for people to access education. If ever there were a need for country people to increase their level of education capacity and ability it is right now. This will enable them to cope with the crisis confronting them now and over the next 10 years or so. We must give every encouragement to higher levels of education throughout rural Australia. I am sure that no-one would argue about achieving that objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need to target the support. In a couple of years it may be some other sector that needs targeting in response to a particular set of circumstances. Any changes to Austudy must be carefully targeted only to the sector with the hardship; hence the proposal put forward by Senator Teague. No-one benefits from a superficial, ill considered motion, such as we have before us today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having spent most of my life in a country area, having members of my direct family still receiving education in country areas of South Australia and having had business interests in country areas of South Australia that have been dramatically affected by present circumstances, not only in economic terms but also in personal terms, I cannot identify to Senator Lees how angry I have become during the past few months about such subjects as the plight of the rural sector, Austudy and the peddling of false hopes to those people. I take exception to the way in which this matter has been handled.
       </para>
       <para>
        What Senator Lees has done in recent months in my State epitomises everything that gives politicians a bad name within our community. Changes to Austudy have to be fair to the rural community and, I stress, equally fair to the community generally, to the taxpayers who are paying for the scheme. As politicians, we represent each and every one of them, not just those pockets of people who we hope may vote or continue to vote for us. For reasons of compassion for the plight of the rural sector and an awareness of the economic situation in which we find ourselves through the inadequacies of the Labor Government, the critical Austudy inadequacies must be addressed by the insertion of hardship clauses in the Austudy regulations. That needs to be done now, not when a report comes out in September-and the Government will take between three and six months to act upon it-so that the net effect is not felt until some time next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition has already called upon the Government to treat this as a matter or urgency. The shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), has indicated quite clearly and specifically that hardship provisions are needed now. All parties recognise there are problems with Austudy, so why is it so difficult for the Government to take some deliberative, determined action to correct what are clearly inadequacies in the system that are directly affecting a section of the community that is now all but helpless because of economic circumstances that have descended upon its shoulders? There have to be hardship provisions so that those who deserve help can access it, not so that more people can abuse the public purse, which will be the end result of the motion that is before us tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition has asked the Government that families, who are being forced to withdraw their children from formal education on financial grounds and who would not otherwise be eligible for Austudy on the ground of the value of assets, receive assistance on a case by case basis. From a personal point of view, I believe that there are workable long term hardship clauses for target groups, such as the rural sector at present, which should at least be considered for Austudy. I shall give an example. If, after averaging its income with assets over the previous five years, a family met the existing Austudy income criteria for families without assets, that family could and should be treated as having nil assets for as long as the five years applied for the family income test level. In that way, we would apply the income test level that is applicable in the metropolitan area to people in the country areas, so that we target help directly to people who can demonstrate that need. We do not open the gates wholly to areas of abuse which, once the gates were opened, could and would be abused.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then there is the higher education contribution scheme for target groups proposed by the honourable member for Wakefield, Mr Andrew, as another alternative, another type of hardship provision, that could be implemented by the Government to address the current crisis. Either of those two suggestions would remove the assets component difficulty for families deemed to be in target groups in temporary need- `in need' being the two important words.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats' way is to tackle that by proposing a motion to give away millions of taxpayers' dollars to anyone who puts out a hand. The right way is for an immediate hardship clause to be inserted that properly targets areas of need. That is coalition policy and we urge the Government, yet again, to move in that direction, and to move fast. Meanwhile there are many potential ways to alter the Austudy regulations which are worthy of further discussion by all parties. I have mentioned two here tonight. I hope that Senator Lees and the Democrats recognise that other members of the Senate from other parties also have a very genuine and real concern for the plight of country people.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship conditions so that families excluded from AUSTUDY by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        I had hoped that the amendment moved by Senator Teague would get the support of the Australian Democrats. It is a responsible amendment. It deals with all of those problems which were raised so well by Senator Olsen and Senator Crichton-Browne and it will meet the needs of many rural families who are suffering very great hardship at the present time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I rise tonight to speak briefly about a matter that was raised by Senator Olsen when he spoke about Senator Lees going around country areas and raising false hopes amongst rural families. I have recently been to a meeting which was attended mainly by wheat farmers and sheep farmers in a country town in the mid-west of Victoria. The issue raised with me at that meeting was the matter of the Austudy proposal that Senator Lees has been going around the Australian countryside promoting. What I said to this meeting, and I think it is worth recording here this evening, is that the Australian Democrats' policies pretend to give major concessions to rural families but that, in essence, their policies are anti-rural and effectively discriminate against rural families.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I may explain that: after mentioning the enormous cost of the sorts of proposals that Senator Lees and Senator Bell are proposing, I asked people at this meeting, `Where do you think this money is going to come from?'. Senator Collins has just pointed out that it is $1.2 billion. I pointed out to these people, `If you believe that you are better off with a wealth tax; if you believe that marginal tax rates on incomes are too low in this country; if you believe in the reintroduction of death duties; and if you believe that we need to have a wealth tax, then you will vote for the Australian Democrats'. There is no question about that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The logic suddenly became very evident to people at the meeting: one can promise to hand out money but it has to be paid for. The reality is that the Australian Democrats are proposing a series of taxes which will have particularly savage effects on rural families. There are over 40 revenue raising measures in the Democrats' alternative Budget, but one particular proposal that will certainly hit not only rural families but also the vast proportion of families in this country is the proposal to have a capital gains tax on the family home.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, if the Democrats have a tax policy which imposes very heavy taxes on people, they should stand up and defend it. The Democrats should not come in here pretending that they can spend billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds without proposing ways to raise this money. This is a debate about a very real problem in the midst of a very real crisis. Senator Teague, to his great credit, has moved a motion which will help alleviate some of the most serious problems which have emerged. I would have thought the Australian Democrats would be prepared to get up and support it, but they are not.
       </para>
       <para>
        It distresses me that the debate we are having is, unfortunately, enabling a bit of grandstanding on the part of both Senator Lees and Senator Bell by pretending that they have the interests of rural families at heart. If Senator Lees has the interests of rural families at heart, why does she propose all these taxes, which will particularly hurt rural families? Why does Senator Lees continue to support things like bans on live sheep exports, which will certainly hurt many people in the sheep industry? Particularly, why does Senator Lees support measures which come before this Parliament which will increase trade union power and privilege? Those are the issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats individually cannot go around saying `We have this nice policy to help rural families' when the vast range of their other policies is very anti-rural. I suggest to both Senator Lees and Senator Bell that they speak to their colleagues Senator Spindler and Senator Paul McLean and ask them to bring their policies into line to assist rural families, not to penalise rural families. I believe that the amendment which has been moved by Senator Teague should be strongly supported. I regret, judging by the comments that we are now getting from the Australian Democrats, that the amendment will not enjoy their support.

        I remind honourable senators of some of the coalition's tax policies. In particular, the coalition's consumption tax will see a tax on a luxury car at the same rate as a tax on a loaf of bread. How will country people feel about having such high taxes on all the items that they have to buy from the local supermarket?

        As for strike action, there is a very big difference between responsible and irresponsible strikes. The Democrats are planning, through our move for the right to strike, to make very definite and distinct differences between what can be enforced and responsible action. In other words, we will still give people the right to meet and to associate without having the threat of action over their heads.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to some comments made by Senator Teague, which are at the heart of the problem. Senator Teague was basically asking us to wait. He said very clearly that we must push and encourage the Government. He talked about urging the Government to act; he talked about hoping that the Government would act; and he talked a lot about helping those who are suffering in the rural communities. On those particular issues, we support him fully. But we cannot keep hoping, urging and wishing that the Government will do something.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here is the opportunity tonight. Senator Teague's amendment seeks to amend my motion. I will explain why we cannot support it. Senator Teague's amendment calls on the Government to act, which is a little more active than hoping, but it still will not achieve anything tonight. On looking at this amendment again, I suggest that Senator Teague should move it as an urgency motion tomorrow. We will support him wholeheartedly. We can debate at length again all the issues we have debated tonight. Most of the issues have been covered very successfully. If Senator Teague moves an urgency motion tomorrow, that is fine, but we will not accept a motion which takes the place of action. The reason that we will not support Senator Teague's amendment tonight is that it removes any compulsion on the Government. Senator Teague has indicated that he will be moving a motion tomorrow, and we welcome that debate. It is a very promising and pleasing sign.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Teague raised a number of other points. He quoted from today's Adelaide Advertiser. Fortunately, we have had a dinner break since Senator Teague spoke and I managed to get back to my office and find the article. The problem of these hardship provisions is well known to all the rural counsellors in South Australia. I can talk specifically about South Australia because I have had some discussions with a number of the rural counsellors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The catch is that, although there are hardship provisions in the regulations, they are almost impossible to access. A couple of months ago my office informally surveyed the Department of Social Security (DSS) offices in regional South Australia. We cannot find a farmer who has managed to access them readily. Why? I will read part of the survey for the benefit of Senator Teague:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . cannot reasonably be expected to sell his property or to use as security for borrowings. They must put their property on the market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Farmers do not want to put their properties on the market. Not wanting to come here tonight with a survey that was a couple of months old, I got my staff to ring around the DSS offices again. After ringing Kadina, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, Port Pirie and Whyalla, we have come up with one farmer who has in fact applied and is still going through the process of hopefully getting hardship provisions. But the comment was that he does not have a very good chance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today my office also contacted the Adelaide Welfare Rights Centre. Its comment was that of course no-one is applying under the hardship provisions. People are told at the counter that they must apply for household assistance, again available to those people who are going off the land. They are being turned away and one reason for this is that the Department does not like paying any special benefits. So hardship provisions have their own set of problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of unemployment benefits, because property values have dropped so much and because the DSS system of valuing properties is far superior to that of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, some farmers have got in under the assets test, but have failed the work test. They are deemed to be underemployed, not unemployed. A lot of them are not told that in fact their wives should apply for unemployment benefits. I have found several cases, particularly on Kangaroo Island, where wives have successfully managed to get unemployment benefits, despite all the hurdles and the number of applications and appeals.

        In looking at some of the things that have been said about valuations, I cannot stress strongly enough that there is no relevance between the value of the land, the buildings, the stock, and the machinery and what the farmer is able to earn. That point has been made extremely well by members of the coalition. A number of speakers have dealt at great length with the hardships that people in rural Australia are now facing. Tools of trade should not be included in the valuation of assets.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look at the valuation problems-and Senator O'Chee highlighted this when he read from a document that I put together-the easiest way to deal with them is to get rid of the initial problem, which is the assets test. Senator O'Chee also pointed out quite correctly that if we are not successful with this motion tonight, the next direction in which we can move is to tackle the method of valuation of the Australian Valuation Office (AVO). Relaxing the assets test is all we want initially but, if that is not successful, we must tackle what the AVO has been doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must particularly tackle the element of retrospectivity. Why should farmers apply in good faith, using State valuations, council valuations or Elders valuations, get their Austudy and then not only have it cut off by a retrospective valuation, but then have to pay it back? If this move is not successful tonight-and it seems that it will not be-the next course of action for the Democrats is to tackle the system of valuation.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to some comments that have been made about our being forced to take out the entire assets test, one would have hoped that honourable senators-particularly some of the long standing senators who have spoken tonight-would have had a thorough understanding of the way this place works. We cannot amend regulations. All we can do is throw them out. I can assure honourable senators that a government that has cut $8 billion cumulative from social security is not going to let $1,000, let alone a couple of million dollars, slip through its fingers. The Government will have the whole assets section rewritten and have the regulations back, I imagine, within weeks and six months at the latest.

         —Within that six months, very few people will be able to get into universities because they are full. The technical and further education colleges are full to overflowing. The only people who would benefit would be a small number of students who have taken the risk and, despite their parents' low income, have gone on to tertiary education without any Austudy support. As Senator Olsen pointed out, many of those people will have to leave. So in the few months that it may take us to get regulations back before this House, there would be a very small leakage, if any. I totally reject Senator Olsen's suggestion that somehow this is opening the gates for manipulation so that people can actually fraudulently claim. I reject any notion that farming communities would be likely to do that. Senator Olsen's suggestion that, by opening this up, we would see an increase is nonsense, although he did read one example of how the Austudy system had been rorted.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I go back to point out what happened with therapeutic goods. Some honourable senators have spoken on this matter since dinner and they were obviously not in the chamber when I last dealt with this issue. When Senator Coulter spoke on this matter, he explained how the regulations were thrown out and then, with considerable consultation and discussion, they were brought back in and passed through this place without any further problems. The same thing could happen and should happen with the Austudy regulations. We throw them out tonight and, if we were able to amend them in the way we wish, that is, to exclude farming families who live and work on their own property and the non-liquid assets of small business people, the total cost would be $26m. But that total cost would only come in if every eligible rural person was able to access.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first hurdle is that even Austudy will not give some country families access to education. Their incomes are so low that, even with Austudy, many of their children are not going to be able to make it, particularly to tertiary education. Even the first hurdle of matriculating may still be beyond some country students. This $26m takes no account of that. We see in South Australia that roughly one-third of applicants who wanted to get into tertiary institutions did not make it. So we see that more people will fall by the wayside.
       </para>
       <para>
        If people do get over all those hurdles and if they matriculate with a good enough pass to get into tertiary education-and the Minister earlier told us that some 48 per cent of students are on Austudy-there is almost a fifty-fifty chance that they will in fact replace someone already getting Austudy. So we see very quickly that this $26m is probably down to more like $10m. If Senator Teague keeps his promise and the Liberal Party does something when it comes into government-and the opinion polls suggest that it will do so in 1993-we will have lost the students in this year's grades 8, 9 and 10, who by then, three years hence, will have made their decisions with regard to their future. Many of them will have opted out.

We can sit here until 2 o'clock in the morning and we can keep calling. The Government has shown no sign at all of moving on this issue. So, by moving the amendment and continuing to call, we are simply wasting our breath. It all becomes more and more hot air. We need action and we will happily join Opposition members. This is an urgency motion and getting it down on paper at a later time is fine but here and now we are debating something that we can do. We can actually remove these specific parts of the regulations, send them off for rewriting and then, when they come back, hopefully they will be in an acceptable form. Again, going back to the issue of therapeutic goods, if discussion is involved, they will be in that form and we can pass them through this chamber.

         —I am glad that I had a few moments after Senator Olsen finished speaking to quell my anger. I agreed with him when he began his speech and said that September was too late for reforms, that there were loopholes and that there was abuse. He then proceeded to state our case quite admirably-the case of the rural community, the people who live on farms and derive their income from rural properties and who are, to use what is now a cliche, asset rich and income poor. However, he offered excuses as to why we should do nothing in this place tonight.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As Senator Lees has just said, Senator Olsen, in referring to abuses, somehow ascribed to the process of what is being proposed here tonight a greater opportunity for absences from college. I really could not see the relevance of that and that is what started to make me angry and, as his speech continued, I became angrier. The relief was that I had a chance to regain my composure before closing this debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats support a comprehensive review of the Austudy scheme and the establishment of a scheme which is simple and which promotes greater access and equity. One of the tactics which we could have used, and which could have worked, would have been for the coalition to have supported us in the lead-up to this debate by suggesting that it was prepared to agree with us, that the proposed new Austudy regulations were worthy of being disallowed. If that threat had been held over the Government's head we may even have seen the process that Senator Lees described-the process of rewriting and revision to make these regulations workable, useful, equitable and sensible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Vast sums of money-I cannot quantify them; they were significant at least-could have been saved if the scheme had been simplified. We are talking about a scheme which requires an applicant to answer almost 100 questions. The application can be rejected if any one of those questions is not properly answered, if a question is answered in an ambiguous fashion, or if the processing clerk does not understand what is being put forward. So the opportunity to have a system which does not work starts on the very first page of the application. Considerable sums of clerical, bureaucratic and taxpayers' money could have been saved if this opportunity had been taken not only to write these regulations in plain English but also to remove the inefficiencies that exist in their very administration. The opportunity was not taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it was very strange that during the debate we heard of a leaked document, or at least a partly understood document, which Senator Olsen again referred to. In the early part of his speech I nodded in agreement with him, that this sort of thing needed to be considered carefully. We heard of a leaked document, or at least a document in preparation. Yesterday's Sunday Age, in an article headed `Austudy may get radical changes' by Michael Gordon, reported:
       </para>
       <para>
        A Government document outlining the scope of the review highlights many criticisms of the scheme, including its impact on farming families and administrative problems such as overpayment and fraud.
       </para>
       <para>
        The document obtained yesterday by the Sunday Age says that it is time to consider whether the current scheme remains appropriate or whether some alternative or modified form of student income support should be introduced. That is a very strange thing to happen in the middle of this debate. The debate started when these regulations were first introduced into the Senate. While that was happening, while our motions of disallowance were impending, at the very last stroke before midnight we saw this matter coming forward without our knowledge and without warning. If there is to be a review, as suggested by this document, we do not want Austudy made worse in the interim. We do not want it made particularly nasty and restrictive in the interim. A wise government, I would have thought, would have left it alone so that it would not suffer the criticisms which derive from these proposed regulations by reducing the amount of income which a spouse can earn from $18,150 to $12,150 before affecting the entitlement of his or her partner to Austudy. If a review of this nature was impending, as illustrated by this newspaper article, I would have thought that a wise government would have avoided the criticism, got on with the review and left in place the regulations which were originally in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        That draws me to the point that the Democrats were not standing idly by during this process and hoping that that was the only string to our bow. We have approached the office of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) about the need for the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and its operations. At the moment its operations are patently unsatisfactory. To allow the Student Assistance Review Tribunal to be given discretionary power to override some of the stringent Austudy rules enable the actions of those hardship provisions which exist at the moment to have been made much easier. The hardship provisions which exist at the moment are, as Senator Lees said, almost impossible to activate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Coalition members come into this place and wave about a bit of paper which has on it some half-baked suggestion that we are going to call on the Government to do something about hardship provisions. This Government will say that there are hardship provisions. The Democrats were trying to find a way of getting those hardship provisions which exist to work. In addition, there were other provisions within the general scope of the legislation which, as Senator Bolkus repeatedly told the Senate, gave the opportunity for those in financial hardship to receive emergency interim payments as a sort of bridge.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several times we were told that such provisions existed. In all my dealings with young people, student unions and people representing young people, I did not find anybody who had found access to that particular hardship proviso. The Opposition suggests that just by calling on the Government to provide more hardship provisions it will somehow solve the immediate problem of those in rural Australia. As Senator Lees said, we can cooee, we can yell, we can beat the drum and do what we like, but it is proposed here to call on the Government to do something. I think the response would be one of cloth ears.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Teague said, the proposed action is direct and immediate. Those are fine sounding words. I do not class the amendment he moved, whereby he calls on the Government to do something, as being direct and immediate. It may be direct if he intended to do it tonight, but its result will certainly not be direct and immediate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Olsen used emotive words when describing the problem that we have as being a cruel one that must be addressed. Another cliche that was thrown around with abandon tonight was the idea that false hope was being perpetrated in the rural areas of Australia. The only false hope is that any action will actually take place. It is a hope which could be rock hard, true and tangible tonight if only the coalition would realise that all that is required of it is to agree with us and disallow these regulations. Then there will be action. There will be no hope about it; it will take place and there will be immediate relief.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, we have this other half-baked amendment before us which I cannot support tonight. It is inappropriate. It is in the wrong forum. It does not belong here. If the Opposition puts up the motion tomorrow-for all that it is worth-it will get the support of the Democrats. Greater, more useful, tangible activity would result from supporting our motion for the disallowance of the assets test component in so far as Senator Lees is concerned and the other aspects as far as I am concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is another matter which needs to be addressed. There are two separate motions for disallowance: the motion which Senator Lees moved on another day, a day other than the one on which I moved a motion-a motion which was intended to be debated in another context-and a motion which, if passed, would result in the removal of the assets test, not the income test.
       </para>
       <para>
        I saw honourable senators waving their arms about and creating all sorts of flurry and fluster about opening the floodgates. No. The assets test removed, alone, would not allow those who have high incomes immediately to acquire the privileges of Austudy. It would have brought relief to those who are, as Senator Olsen described them, asset rich and income poor. It would not have brought a sudden flood of wealthy, high income people into this category.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why we separated these two notices of motion; that is why we wanted these things discussed separately; that is why we divided over the issue of the cognate debate; and that is why I presented a separate argument from the argument presented by Senator Lees. The confusion that the Opposition suffered over the matter is a confusion which it could well have removed by understanding what was being proposed and by not acceding to the rearrangement of Government Business so that there was a cognate debate on these two motions.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further confusion was perpetrated by other honourable senators, especially members of the coalition, who brought into the debate the isolated children's allowance. We had a good, solid 10 minutes from Senator O'Chee about that, and several other honourable senators mentioned it in passing. The fact is that the isolated children's allowance-which we would prefer to call the isolated children's entitlement-receives the Democrats' strong support, and a suggestion by anybody that that has anything to do with this particular debate is erroneous, misleading and dishonest because it paints an entirely different picture from that which is, in fact, true.
       </para>
       <para>
        Talking of things that are untrue and irrelevant, it is a pity that Senator Teague had to resort to fictional composition to alarm voters with the worst things that he could dream up and then disguise those horrendous things as Democrat policy. I could invent here tonight a whole bunch of Liberal policies. I would not be doing anything different from what is being done by Dr Hewson quite often-inventing policies on the run. I could invent policies which suggest that there be a tax on the family television or free privileges for certain people-anybody whose name starts with `T' could get a doubling of salary.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could invent policies, but I certainly cannot produce, in Democrat policies-which are written, which are tangible and which, unlike a lot of coalition policies, are actually on paper-evidence of the sort of alarmist garbage that we heard from coalition speakers time after time. There is no mention-and there never has been-of a capital gains tax on the family home. Anybody who can identify that as a Democrat policy has looked at policies that certainly I have never taken part in promoting or forming.
       </para>
       <para>
        That fiction is a very dishonest, guttersnipe fiction which is perpetrated far too often by people that I have to refer to as `honourable senators', and it sticks in my craw to have to do that. I find it insulting in the extreme for people to come in here, invent policies and then claim that we hold them. Our policies are written down, they are in black and white and we stand by them. They do not include the sort of trash that was thrown around tonight. The anger that I felt when hearing that has been very hard to contain.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rest of the debate seemed to follow a fairly predictable pattern. In fact, there was a predictable performance from Senator O'Chee. It amuses me to think about it. Sitting next to Senator Bjelke-Petersen might make it a little easier for Senator O'Chee, and it might help him to ask Senator Bjelke-Petersen what a blancmange is. I think she would describe it to him as something which is fairly vacuous, appears attractive on the outside but really is not substantial. I am reminded of that when I think of the contribution that Senator O'Chee made. There really was not a lot of content-there were a lot of crocodile tears but I think they only served to dissolve the blancmange. His contribution was predictable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to Senator Crane's contribution. I thought that Senator Crane made a perfect case for the removal of the assets test. He described the volatility of farm values, and I think he was accurate in that. I agree with him. That is the very reason for removing the assets test from Austudy measurements. Senator Crane read out a set of figures the relevance of which I did not understand. I think he was supporting the Government and saying that the present expenditure on education is wonderfully adequate in comparison with some other countries. We know that that is not true; we know that it is not adequate; thousands of students know that it is not adequate; and the families of those students know that it is not adequate. I do not know where the figures came from and I do not really understand why they were introduced into this debate. I do not understand why Senator Crane would want to fly in the face of such concerted knowledge about what is adequate and what is sufficient in this particular area of Government expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The debate continued with, again, the predictable contribution that we quite often get from the coalition. I think that can only be summarised as being a stupid contention that this particular Democrat initiative cannot be supported because it will give advantage to more people in the city compared to people in rural areas. Of course it will. In case it has escaped the attention of the people in the coalition who accused us of dreaming up this idea, Australia is one of the most highly urbanised nations on this earth. Of course any move at all will have a greater effect on those who live in urban areas than those who live in the country, but those who live in rural areas of Australia who are disadvantaged by the present regulations will be more favourably advantaged by any removal of the assets test on Austudy provisions. In representing my State of Tasmania, I am well aware of the fact that Tasmania is the least urbanised of our States.

       <para>
        The assets test was described at some stage during the debate as `a battle of popularism' where people were trying to appeal to various segments of the electorate, and this followed on from the debate that there is a dichotomy between rural and urban. I disagree with Senator Reid that we are proposing a universal benefit. We are opposing the new regulations. The effect of that opposition is something which the Government inherits. When our activities threaten what the Government proposes or what the Government wants, we see it as the Government's role to continue its own fiscal responsibility and use the regulations which now exist, or which could be introduced or reintroduced at any stage by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to a letter from the Clerk of the Senate who, when asked about the effect of the actions that we proposed, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is nothing in the Act to prevent the making at any time of new regulations not the same in substance as regulations disallowed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is surely not beyond the wit or imagination of a government, if threatened by disallowance, to concoct new regulations which would have a similar effect but which would take into account the will of the Senate, the Parliament and, I suggest, the people. It is surely not beyond the capacity of a government to devise regulations which meet the needs that are expressed by a Senate which disallows previous regulations. It is also not a fact that the sky will fall in or that all chaos will reign if those regulations which we propose to disallow are disallowed. It should be within the capacity of the Government to meet that contingency if there is a sufficient threat that it might happen. That is the axis of this whole issue because the Government at no time has really believed that this will really happen. It was sufficiently strong in its belief that the faith of the Opposition to support it in this matter would not be shaken that no effort was made to devise regulations which would do the job better. It has complacently sat on its hands and said, `The Democrats will wave their arms in the air, nothing will happen and we do not have to try very hard at all'. That is a result of the Opposition's lack of real concern to see something decent resolved here.
       </para>
       <para>
        We see a lot of crocodile tears from this Opposition and hear cries such as, `Oh, woe is the country', `Oh, dear, how terrible it is' and `Things are evil and things are crook', but when it comes to action, what do we see? We see faithful support of the Government, the excuse being, `We might not get everything right. There might be something a bit wrong and the Government really would not like to have its regulations upset'. I do not know whether that is accurate, but that is certainly the feeling I have.

         —The Minister might be interested that, as I heard it, Senator Crichton-Browne suggested that the assets test was an equitable criterion. He then said that the level of income was declining and he gave figures to support that. He had the temerity to scream at the Democrats with information and anecdotes to support it as we sat here waiting. Senator Crichton-Browne stated our case and justified our desperation to do something. I waited for the `but' that often comes at the end of statements such as, `Yes, things are terrible; it is really bad', which would justify his inaction, but it did not come. But his inaction will come: his compliance with what the Government is proposing will follow on as predictably as it always does.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This notion that the Democrats cannot deliver and that it does not matter what our propositions are is only reinforced when we see the coalition refusing to consider some action. We can deliver; we have promised just now to deliver on Senator Teague's amendment, and we will when it becomes the subject of a matter of urgency or an urgency motion. We have promised that. Our initiatives are inaction only when the coalition refuses to act. It refuses to act on the grounds that there will be some huge cost visited upon the Australian taxpayer by our proposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees has brought reality to that proposition. She has demonstrated in eloquent terms how, when it comes to the exercise of the Austudy option, even $26m is a generous accounting of the costs that could accrue from her disallowance motion. I suggest that, if the disallowance motion that I have proposed is considered and supported, the figures which were thrown around about the cost to the country are entirely fictitious because they do not pay regard to the reality of how this would work. We would not see the uptake of the sorts of horrendous figures that are postulated by the Opposition; we would not see a cost to the nation of that order. I suspect that, if double-counting is not involved, there is certainly not realistic counting of what offsets there would be.
       </para>
       <para>
        In considering these regulations and proposing to disallow them, we have demonstrated their inadequacy and the huge change from the existing Austudy regulations, which, bad as they might be at the moment, at least do not visit upon spouses such a huge reduction of their allowable income from $18,000 to $12,000 and restrain the acceptance of tertiary places by so many people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will repeat the challenge: if the Government is conducting this review, the last thing we want to do right now is make Austudy worse. The Government could withdraw all the new regulations and persist with the old ones. If this review, which has not been well-aired but which has been described as being urgent and which is supported by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its report on student finances, is in the offing, let us not make Austudy worse in the interim.

        <para>
         That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, to bring on a matter of urgency.
        </para>
        <para>
         This motion will allow me to move an urgency motion concerning emergency educational assistance. In moving for the suspension of Standing Orders, I not only take up the offer that the Australian Democrats made in the preceding debate to fully support the words of the amendment that I had moved to the disallowance motion but also, of course, carry forward the genuine intentions and the position of the Opposition to impress upon the Government of the day that this Senate, by a majority decision, calls upon the Government to implement hardship provisions in exactly the form that I on behalf of the Opposition referred to during the debate on disallowance motions.
        </para>
        <para>
         If we were to ask the simple question as to who would be covered, clearly the answer would be those eligible for Austudy on general grounds: full time students over 16 years of age in approved courses. But who, in particular, will be covered? It will be those who are otherwise limited by the assets test and who are suffering with an income loss as a result of the rural crisis. When do we want this to be implemented? We want it immediately. What is to be implemented? It is emergency educational assistance. How is it to be implemented? It is to be implemented by hardship provisions comparable with those hardship provisions that already exist, for example, in the Social Security Act.
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not need to give the substance of the debate that would flow, except to say that it is urgent and that we should deal with this while we are fresh from five hours of debate. More than seven Opposition speakers urged this outcome in their speeches today in the Senate. So did the two principal speakers of the Australian Democrats. They said, `If the Opposition cannot support our disallowance motions, Senator Teague should move this as an urgency motion standing alone and you have our support'. I do not wish to canvass any more than the opportunity for us to resolve urgently this matter and to find the expression of all those who have spoken on this matter from the Opposition and Democrat sides-I see Senator McLean, Senator Kernot and others nodding.

        That the Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from AUSTUDY by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        I intend to speak on this matter for only a few minutes because, in my half-hour speech on the matter before us in the Senate this afternoon, I gave eminent reasons for the support of this urgent motion, which requires the Government to act immediately to meet the needs of families suffering in the rural crisis.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note the speeches of more than seven Opposition senators in support of that proposition. Those senators were drawn from not only my own State of South Australia but also Queensland, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and I know that the same holds for Tasmania and New South Wales. Every part of Australia has at the moment families, some of whom have considerable primary production assets but who are receiving zero or negative incomes as a result of the tragedies of the present rural crisis. They are not in a position, as is contemplated by the current assets test, to sell off some of their assets. They are not able to use the assets they have to gain carry-on loans from banks for two reasons. The first is that in many cases it is not viable to dissect a portion of a viable property, whether it is an outback station or a mid-country farm, or whether it is in intensive horticulture. Secondly, they have not an income flow that would be able to maintain repayments on a loan even if a bank were otherwise to approve them for short term assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        In these circumstances there is a direct need in the rural crisis, as the Opposition has outlined today, for an exception to be made. We would see that exception as holding whenever there is a rural crisis. One senator referred to the earthquake in Newcastle as perhaps being another particular tragedy that might lead to particular Government emergency assistance or hardship provisions for a particular region. I do not want to argue the merits of further analogy or further example than the current rural crisis that we all feel so keenly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe from my discussions in the corridors that there are Government members who are only too aware of the rural crisis. They are thankful that because of the pressure in the Parliament the assets test was liberalised beyond the onerous level that was imposed by the Budget decision last year. We are all thankful that reason was able to prevail with the Government to get that burden lifted for primary producers-for farmers-and for their families suffering in rural areas. We want that kind of immediate response from the Government answering an overwhelming vote in support of this motion here tonight in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred earlier today to the statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) reported today that he was bringing to the attention of farming families that there are hardship provisions under the Social Security Act and that these hardship provisions suspend the ordinary operation of the assets test. We want the Government to apply those provisions in a parallel way to Austudy so that we will have the outcome that the Opposition desires, that is, that no families whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis will be excluded from Austudy by the assets test, and that they will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this is not just a motion that will become a resolution of the Senate. It calls for action. If the Government does not act, it will hear about that on a continuing and increasing basis. It will hear about that from farming families suffering in the rural crisis. It will hear about it from the Opposition. I think the support we have gained from the Australian Democrats for this Opposition initiative tonight will mean that the Democrats also will press this point on the Government in the days to come.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not want just to win the numbers in a particular debate in the Senate. I impress on Senator Collins, on his advisers and on all other Government senators who are present in the chamber that the Opposition wants to see action and wants to see it direct and immediate. We do not support the abolition of the assets test as a whole. We believe in the targeting of Austudy to meet those in greatest financial need. We understand the consequence of the normal income test and assets test, and we ask that in addition to that the Government directly address the extreme financial circumstances currently being experienced by those who are suffering in the rural crisis. I hope that the Democrats will support this and that, by the Government conceding that this will be carried on the voices, we have the hearts and minds of Government senators behind us in support of this motion tonight. I commend it to the Senate.

         —We did challenge the Opposition to bring forward as a motion the amendment which it had trotted out during the debate on the disallowance of various parts of the regulations for Austudy. I say `trotted out' because it seemed that it was a misplaced amendment in that debate. The temptation is to call it a fairly useless motion now because, as we observed during that debate, the amendment began by saying, `The Senate calls on the Government'. I will not waste the time of the Senate by repeating the feelings I had about the usefulness of the Senate calling on the Government to do something rather than forcing it to do things, as the Senate could have done had it supported our motion for disallowance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, let us look at some of the other things that are required to be done by this calling on the Government. The motion continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no indication as to what sorts of provisions. It refers just to hardship provisions. There is no definition given to what is a hardship provision or what is hardship. In effect, in this motion we are trusting the Government to understand what the Opposition is thinking about here. Perhaps the Government has got the message but in essence what is being done by this motion is to trust the Government which claims that there already are hardship provisions. I contend that those hardship provisions demonstrably do not work, have not worked and cannot be made to work in the context in which the present Government gives it to operate.
       </para>
       <para>
        While supporting this motion we would ask the Senate to call on the Government-and to trust the Government-to make hardship provisions. The Government, in fact, argues that it has hardship provisions, but we say that they do not work. So we are in a fairly vague situation already. I believe that the Opposition has moved this motion because, having done that, it is an excuse for not taking the difficult option of supporting Senator Lees's motion, at the very least, and for hiding behind the contention that a motion such as that put by Senator Lees would actually cost money. I suggest, though, that it is not so much a question of the money that it would cost. It is the priority that we ascribe to our educational needs that is under threat here, not so much the question of money being removed from another source. As was our contention during the debate, the money being referred to is not in the huge, frightening sphere that has been suggested by others. So, we see the excuse for the Opposition taking the option that it has, but I contend that it will have very little effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has suggested that it wants to see the Government apply the existing provisions. That is a very strange assertion to make. A series of questions asked by myself and a number of other Democrat senators over a number of months has demonstrated that the existing provisions do not work. It is rather strange to suggest that we should apply something that does not work, and especially to trust the Government to introduce something that has not been accurately defined or delineated in any way. Then there was the great threat that, if this was not done, the Government would hear about it. For goodness sake, the Government is hearing about it. It has been hounded from one side of the nation to the other by thousands of students and their parents, as well as institutions that the students attend, and their advocates in every shape and form. Also, there have been editorials, from which I quoted during my speech on the disallowance motion, as well as articles and letters to the editor.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is hearing about it, but what is it doing? It is doing about as much as the Opposition is doing: refusing to support a motion which tonight could have done something about the matter. It has come up with this motion but, while I agree with the sentiments and concerns, I have little faith in its capacity to actually achieve any sort of desirable result. We might have been better off not wasting the time of the Senate with this latest contribution. I conclude with those remarks. The Democrats will support the motion, but we do not have a lot of faith in its ability to do anything useful.

         —Like the two previous speakers, I see no reason to unduly delay the business of the Senate, as all of these matters have been covered at some length in the previous five hours of debate. I appreciate Senator Teague's action in moving this urgency motion tonight, because I think that that was the appropriate course of action to take rather than leaving this matter for debate tomorrow or at a later date, when we would be reviving the debate when it was not so fresh in our minds.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I agree with a number of the comments that Senator Bell has made, but there are also some that I disagree with. I thought that Senator Olsen in his contribution to the debate dealt very effectively with Senator Lees's motion. I must say that I found it difficult to follow, in terms of what I understand to be some fundamental Democrat philosophies, the arguments that were put forward in support of Senator Lees's proposition by the Australian Democrats during the debate. This is because there are some fundamental issues of principle involved here which do not necessarily go to the question of the actual number of dollars concerned. When one is talking about social security payments-that is, payments of public money to people in need-those issues of principle have to apply fairly and equitably, nationally. I thought the Democrats' argument was rather peculiar.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lees conceded, though, that there would be some anomalies. Senator Olsen put it rather well, I thought, when he said that if there were anomalies and inequities with the current scheme-which, of course, will be addressed by the review that the Government has initiated into the scheme-the removal of an assets test, as proposed by Senator Lees, would simply exacerbate those anomalies, which indeed it would. That point was conceded by the Democrats, who then said, `Well, it doesn't matter, because in total it amounts to only $60m a year extra being distributed to people who perhaps do not need it'. Fundamentally, I think it does matter, and I was surprised to hear that comment from the Democrats.
       </para>
       <para>
        I, for example, was one of those Australians who were glad when I no longer had the benefit of child endowment. I did not ever think that our family should get it. I was delighted when the Government introduced provisions that meant that we did not get it. It saved my wife and I the trouble of doing what we did with the money, namely, giving it to a children's charity of our choice. I was pleased when the Government introduced those provisions, because I think there is a fundamental principle involved in providing government funds to people who are in need. Recognising as I do-I do not live in some cloud cuckoo land-the great difficulties in providing for any perfect system in the application of social security on a national basis, because there will always be a number of people determined to work it to death and rip it off, in so far as it is possible to do so I think the Government has an obligation to provide a basis for fairness and equity in that system, no matter what the dollar cost is.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as Senator Bell's proposal is concerned, the difficulty that the Government has-and I think this applies to the Opposition also-is that it would have the extremely undesirable effect not only of costing $1.2 billion a year more than it currently does to administer the scheme but also in the interim it would completely cut off all Austudy payments to the people who are currently getting them. I think that that would be an undesirable end.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to Senator Teague's amendment to Senator Lees's motion, the Government opposed that for the same reason that Senator Bell gave-and this was covered in the statements that I said a moment ago I agreed with. Senator Teague in fact confirmed what I thought might be the case, when he said-and I think I am quoting him exactly-that the provisions referred to in John Kerin's press statement, issued yesterday, should apply to the assets test for Austudy. The concern that I have about that, as Senator Bell quite rightly pointed out, is that there is no particular definition of the hardship allowance. However, Senator Teague has qualified that by saying, and he has just confirmed it again, that the provisions as they apply to suspending the assets test in the case of social security payments-which are quite strict, as perhaps they should be-should simply be moved across to Austudy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The difficulty that I have with that, off the top of my head-and I might be wrong about this; this is purely a personal assessment that I have made from reading the list, and it may prove not to be the case on analysis-is that the current provisions that apply to Austudy payments for farmers, that is, a 50 per cent discount, and the fact that it is a net value, net of debts, mortgages, and so on, could well, on analysis, prove to be more beneficial to the farmers than, from my quick scanning of the list, the conditions that apply with hardship allowances in relation to social security payments.

By the way, I also qualify that further by saying that it may not even be appropriate for the same conditions that apply to social security payments, like supporting mothers allowance and unemployment benefit, to apply to Austudy allowance, for the simple reason, of course, that they are designed to do different things. For that reason, I think that more appropriately it is a matter for the Government to consider, as it will, during the overall review that the Government has initiated with the Austudy scheme. For that reason, tonight we are not prepared to support Senator Teague's motion although, as I say again, I do personally appreciate his action in moving it tonight. In closing, I indicate that we will be opposing it, but not calling for a division.

Of course it is not a social security payment; it is a payment in respect of the education of children. I might just say that, when the Government is comparing the tax rebates and tax deductions that firms can get for the education of their employees or alternatively for sending their employees overseas, whether those firms are productive, efficient and wealthy or whether they are poor and inefficient, a distinction is not made. But, when it comes to the most important business in Australia, a distinction is made.

        Let me get it clear: the Minister then turned to the family allowance and said that that was a social security payment. Far from its being a social security payment, the then Minister for Social Security, former Senator Don Grimes, made it perfectly clear that, as part of the tax transfer system and as a matter of tax equity, the family allowance payments were in recognition of the fact that families with children were not in a similar position to pay taxes as were families without children.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate that the family allowance arose after the tax concessional system for children and then the tax rebate for children were abolished. In their place, the family allowance was introduced. It is not a social security matter but a matter of tax equity. It was a transfer of moneys out of the hip pocket to the purse, but it was put into the Social Security budget. Since then successive governments have filched a total of $18 billion from the purses of mothers. That is what has happened. I think the Senate should be very clear as to what we are talking about. It is not a social security matter at all.

        Coming to the question of Austudy that is before us, we can have a number of people, particularly in the rural industry, who are theoretically asset rich but income poor. They in particular are the ones who are suffering at the present moment. I support what is before the chamber, but I would have liked to support a stronger measure which would have forced the Government to act. I just make the point that not only are these people unable to get Austudy but they cannot even claim the cost that they bear in educating their children at tertiary level, let alone primary and secondary levels, as a tax deduction. Let us compare that with the massive tax incentives and deductions that are given to firms. I ask the Senate: what is the most important business in Australia? It is the family, and the family is under attack by this Government in this area as well as in other areas.

        I believe that it behoves the Government to take action in this area urgently because injustice is now being meted out to people who are already suffering from the recession and the economic crisis which this Government, to a certain extent, is responsible for.

From 3.30 p.m. today until now, close to 10.30 p.m., we have been expressing our concerns about Austudy, about the rural crisis and about the need for the Government to act immediately to relieve the burden on rural families whose children are undertaking full time study, whether at secondary or tertiary level, and who could be forced, and are being forced, to discontinue their studies on account of the hardships borne by them as a result of the rural crisis.

        I wish to refer to only two matters that Senator Bell raised. First of all, I welcomed when it was made the statement that the Democrats would support a motion moved in these terms by the Opposition, but I assure the Senate that the intention to move this motion was already very well prepared this morning. It was typed up; it was very clear. The logic of predicting this afternoon's debate was clear to blind Freddy. As a result, in order to gain the maximum that could be gained for rural families in the present crisis, it was necessary for the Opposition to take this initiative and to have that totally planned. The reason why it was not canvassed earlier was that we still held out a hope that there would have been support for the amendment in the course of this afternoon's debate rather than in the form that is now before the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second item that I respond to in Senator Bell's remarks-and I mean this very sincerely-is that even those who are new in the Senate should not underestimate the power of persuasion of a majority argument that has not just got the numbers but has the merit of the argument as well. When we are in government, in another year and a half, I hope that we will be impressed by such a body of opinion as can be gained by majority support in the Senate, or the House of Representatives, on a matter that might not otherwise go on party lines in that place. We do great disservice to ourselves if in this debate we say that the use of the phrase `calls on the Government' is, to take a pessimistic view, doomed from the start. I believe very sincerely that there has already been sufficient expression by Senator Collins, and indeed in private comments from Government members, that they want the Government to act and that they want a motion such as this as a good launching point to take effective, immediate action to assist rural families.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank Senator Collins for his sensible speech. I thank him for his welcoming of the form of the motion being put here tonight and its being resolved before we rise at 10.30 p.m. I want to make it quite clear that when I referred to the remarks of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), which were released yesterday and reported today, with regard to hardship provisions relating to the Social Security Act, I was not exactly prescribing that they be exactly translated into the Austudy regulations. I am interested in the outcome. I want a similar outcome whereby the normal requirements that apply in the Social Security Act are moved, by the Government's direct and immediate action, to allow families, who would otherwise have been excluded, to be eligible for some benefits in light of the hardships they are experiencing as a result of the rural crisis. It is that outcome that this motion calls for. It does not prescribe to the Government the exact measures that would be required to obtain that outcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we had the full armoury of information that is available to the Government, the Opposition would have added particular terms to the motion that is before the Senate tonight. We draw back from that and leave our motion in sufficiently general terms so that it prescribes the target area and the target outcome. We are looking for the Government's action to prescribe that in the best way. I define `best way' as meaning that it will actually gain the practical outcome we have been calling for in the debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one other matter I wish to refer to. This outcome is gained not only by hardship provisions being implemented, but also by measures in the administration of Austudy. In particular, I refer to the valuation procedure. Several senators, including myself, have referred directly to the valuation procedure of the Australian Valuation Office. Everyone who has spoken on this matter in the Senate today has said that the Australian Valuation Office is overestimating the value of rural properties and that these inflated values ought not to apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bell in his speech just now referred to the remarks made by my colleague Senator Crane. I do not think he understood Senator Crane's main point which was that for practical purposes banks have a stress value for a rural property, and they will give loans up to a proportion-in the present extreme crisis, 40 per cent-of the stress level which is itself a proportion of the apparent market value. But the Australian Valuation Office has even got the market value wrong. I believe that Senator Crane's remarks are entirely pertinent and ought to be taken into account by the Government in determining a valuation that is meaningful. If it is a matter of hardship provisions, at least those hardship provisions should be applied so that there is an outcome whereby rural families, particularly those involved in primary production, do not have properties valued at more than the kind of limit that Senator Crane rightly referred to.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the themes through the speeches-and I can speak especially for my colleagues in the Opposition-have indicated yet again that not only in the wool debate and in each primary industry matter that has been before us in recent months but also in this Austudy debate there has been a cry out there in the bush that we are hearing and responding to. Sure, we do have well-developed policies that will be even further refined to be implemented by the Opposition in government. But we are not resting on that alone, we want to see immediate, direct action to meet this particular crisis.
       </para>
       <para>
        In saying that, I want to say to the bush, to rural families in the country, that we understand the burden they are feeling and we are responding directly. We know the burden that is being felt in the Mallee, in the Eyre Peninsula, in the west out to Meekatharra, in Tasmania and in Queensland. We know that there is an enormous struggle. I am deeply moved when I hear medical practitioners say that all their patients showing up in the middle of the Mallee have distress symptoms. On behalf of the Opposition, I want to assure those living in country areas that we have heard the cry. We will continue to be with them; we want to share the burden with them; and we want to ensure that they know that the representatives elected from rural areas are bringing those cries of anguish to our deliberations here in the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the Senate for the support that has been expressed. I assure the Government that we will be watching to see that this is implemented not in September when the Austudy review may be determined but this month-the month of May. It is important that we get direct, immediate action from the Government so that families get the immediate signal that their children can continue to be enrolled in secondary and tertiary study.

      <para>
       I wish to direct my remarks in particular to one of the applications for an advance from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. It concerns a sum of $97,000, which is described by the Department of Community Services and Health as being necessary `to provide general financial support grants towards the infrastructure costs of key national non-government organisations which represent consumers and interest groups in the community services sector'. It is under the category of `urgent and unforeseen' and the explanation reads as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       The request is urgent since one of the conditions of grant is that quarterly payments are to be made in advance and the fourth quarter payment is due in early April . . . was unforeseen at Budget time as if the amount of supplementation necessary to adjust the Budget provision for the effect of price and wages increases since the beginning of the financial year.
      </para>
      <para>
       I find it quite difficult to believe that at the time of the Budget preparation that degree of foresight was unable to be made because, in fact, those increases have not been greater than the general forecast.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have been concerned for a considerable period of time generally about the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. As we go through these applications, we see that perhaps sloppiness in preparation of Budget figures can be a cause. In Estimates, I have asked that we see a report, if possible, of the numbers of applications that are made by departments to the Minister for Finance which in fact have been knocked back. I think this would give us an indication of what departments--

         —I thank the Senate. It is not necessary to go into great detail on this matter because it is now on the public record. But I emphasise that I was one of those who were responsible for the setting up of this fighting fund, as was my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) in the other place. Senator McKiernan's question today, in part, reads:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Can the Minister advise honourable senators whether the NFF, if it is so well off, is using at least some of this money to help its members and the broad community to work with the Government and industry to promote Australian primary products overseas?
       </para>
       <para>
        I will come to that matter in a moment. In Senator Cook's answer-I make particular reference to Troubleshooters Available seeking to have the classification of `worker' redefined as `contractor'-there was a suggestion that this case has no relevance to the farm sector. It has a very real relevance. It will become more relevant during the rural crisis, because we are now seeing in much of rural Australia the use of more and more contractors in farm operations rather than farms keeping permanent employees in place. If this concept is developed, at least those people will be given the opportunity to work for some of the year rather than not work at all. So the case referred to in the answer is very relevant.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to emphasise another point regarding Senator Cook's answer today. The answer, in part, reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, those things which open markets for Australian rural products are of a higher priority than this matter, which I consider to be a wrong priority for farmers. I do not know what a family on a farm in Australia which is facing hardship in the economic circumstances of today, because of the operation of those trading blocs in the world, thinks about its money, or money that could be spent in aid of its immediate needs, being spent on esoteric legal actions in the field of industrial relations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to a couple of cases where the fighting fund has been used. I want to emphasise the broad application of this fund and the length and breadth in which the trustees of that fund may operate. I know what farmers and rural people think of the recent waterfront deal in which $12 per week was agreed to with no reform of work practices. In terms of the inefficient work practices on the waterfront, it is worth emphasising that farmers pick up some 20 per cent of the direct costs of wharf inefficiencies and a significant amount more in indirect costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I highlight some of the applications for which the Australian farmers fighting fund has been used: to contribute to funding the national priorities project to identify where major cuts in government spending could be made and to analyse taxation options; to jointly fund a project with banks to develop a scheme to mediate on particular debt problems facing individual farmers; to part fund a global trade study which examined the macro-economic consequences of farm support policies; to develop a trade game plan to analyse agricultural trade opportunities; and-in regard to the trading blocs that were mentioned in the answer today-to establish an international coalition of farm organisations and companies to exert pressure on the governments to seek agricultural trade reforms in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not read out all of these applications tonight but, because of my interest in this subject and my involvement in its establishment, I wanted to emphasise the broad aspects for which this fund has been used. Since it was established, it has been involved in 55 different projects across a whole range of activities. When a loaded question is put before this place and we get a loaded answer, it is important that the record is set straight on this fund and, for that matter, any other issue that may come before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I re-emphasise that there is no secret about what the fund has been used for. I do not know how much money is in it-that is the responsibility of the trustees of that particular fund-and what they say about it is their responsibility. It is not an item of public knowledge or public right. Certainly, the activities for which that fund has been used are now on the public record. That information has been made available to anybody who wishes to seek it and I am rather disappointed that today we heard such a loaded question and answer, which absolutely distorted what the fund has been used for.

       Yes, the Taxpayer Assistance Group entered into a contract with Roy Morgan Research Centre in 1989 to survey taxpayers' attitudes to self assessment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Yes; the contract required the Centre to undertake a quantitative research phase using the questionnaire agreed on by the Office of Government Information and Advertising (OGIA), ATO and the Centre and a qualitative research phase, aimed at determining

      </para>
      <para>
       The survey was to include 11 questions, of which three were open-ended, to be asked in an omnibus survey; the three questions were to be decided in a pilot survey. Respondents were to be male or female taxpayers of any age, in all states, in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. The qualitative stage was to be a series of group discussions to amplify and explain survey results.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report was required to describe what impact self assessment had had on the habits, beliefs, and knowledge of taxpayers and their attitudes to the Tax Office.

       (d) Yes; two questionnaires were used, one for the Omnibus survey (designed by ATO staff in consultation with the Centre) and one for the group discussion (designed by the Centre and amended in consultation with ATO staff after a pilot survey); both questionnaires were submitted to the Office before the survey began.
      </para>

      <para>
       (k) The Prices Surveillance Authority commissioned two studies on its public profile. The Roy Morgan Research Centre did a quantitative survey to find out how many people had heard of the PSA; whether they thought it was successful and what they thought it should be doing. Another company (Diagnostic and Creative Workshop) conducted a qualitative survey and undertook in-depth interviews to gauge people's attitudes to the Authority.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Authority used the results to lift its public image through more publicity and conveying a more active and consumer oriented image.
      </para>
      <para>
       As it has no powers of enforcement, the Authority must rely heavily on developing a positive community profile which will encourage co-operation from private and public sector businesses. To this end, the PSA has put in place a program of positive public communication.
      </para>
      <para>
       (l) The PSA, in consultation with the Minister's office and with the assistance of OGIA, commissioned the survey.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) made the following number of requests for valuations from the Australian Valuation Office (AVO) under Regulation 20 of the student assistance legislation:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) in 1989-90-279

      </para>
      <para>
       This total of 618 represents the number of AUSTUDY recipients whose cases were subject to an assets review. Many cases resulted in more than one valuation being carried out by the AVO.
      </para>
      <para>
       The total number of requests made by DEET for AVO services will differ from the number of requests registered by the AVO as being received from DEET during a particular period. For example, a request from DEET may result in the AVO undertaking valuations on properties in more than one State. Thus one request from DEET may be registered as a request by more than one AVO State office.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) Of the total requests, 208 (34 per cent) resulted in a decision to terminate AUSTUDY payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) `Of that total of 208, 107 (51 per cent) affected students whose residential address was given as being outside a capital city or other urban area. The breakdown by State/Territory is as follows:

       The number of decisions to terminate in the case of South Australia is comparatively large because of a pilot benefits control project carried out in that State in 1990, based on a random sample of beneficiaries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) As a result of the valuations, 208 requests for repayment were made. The answer to this question is the same as for 2(a) as, once the assets test threshold is exceeded, students are no longer eligible for benefits.

They advised they could not prevent the practice, and did not support it. The use of sodium cromoglycate eye drops made by the local pharmacist is not without danger. The sterility, quality, safety and efficacy of such a preparation is unknown.

Other contributors to the campaign were the PSU, Australia Post and Telecom. The campaign was supported because it was closely related to RBO's own campaign on the PSS.

        —On 5 March 1991 (Hansard page 1132) Senator Short asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning comments by Senator the Hon. Peter Walsh on Australian fiscal policy in the 1980s. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>

      <para>
       The formulation of fiscal policy in recent years has been directed at the medium-term objectives of increasing public sector saving to ease pressure on the current account deficit and continuing the process of public sector reform to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs and business enterprises. Senator the Hon Peter Walsh, in a paper titled ``Australian Fiscal Policy in the 1980s'', commented that ``it can be argued that the present recession is a function of fiscal policy being too loose''. That is a difficult argument to sustain given that total public sector outlays as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics fell by over 3 per cent in real terms between 1985-86 and 1988-89 contributing to a turnaround in the total public sector net borrowing requirement of over 6 percentage points of GDP from a deficit of 4.5 per cent of GDP in 1985-86 to a surplus of 1.7 per cent of GDP in 1988-89. The extent of the fiscal consolidation at the Commonwealth level over this period is currently being reflected in the maintenance of the Commonwealth budget surplus during a period of subdued economic activity.

      <para>
       In considering the choice of policy instruments to curb the recent economic boom, there is a need to have regard to the factors contributing to the boom. Real wage restraint over the period since the Accord resulted in falling real unit labour costs, contributing to higher profits and higher investment. In addition, increased government saving in the second half of the 1980s meant that there was a larger pool of domestic funds available to finance this investment. Other factors which encouraged investment in the recent boom were increased demand associated with an improvement in the terms of trade and a relatively high level of liquidity in the economy because of concerns about the 1987 stockmarket crash. Asset price inflation, in part driven by speculative elements, was an additional factor contributing to investment activity. Furthermore, part of the Budget surplus in recent years has been used to reduce personal income tax in order to obtain greater wage restraint, without which the economic slowdown would have been more marked.
      </para>
      <para>
       In view of the overall strength of domestic demand, and the surge in private investment in particular, in the recent boom, the appropriate strategy was the one adopted by the Government; namely, to maintain firm fiscal policy settings and to tighten monetary policy.
