       Plant Variety Rights
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving `property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) a slowing down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any systems such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.
      </para>
      <para>
       And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

       Victorian Planning (Brothels) Act 1984
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas the Commonwealth of Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1983, the Government of Victoria in passing the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 is in breach of Article 6 of the Convention which says that `States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women'.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Victorian Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 provides legal authority to brothel operators to traffic in and exploit the prostitution of women and to live off the earnings of prostitutes.
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas the Federal Minister for Health has counselled citizens to shun promiscuity (The Australian 26.1.85) because of the serious and sometimes fatal health hazards, the operation of legalised brothels encourages promiscuity and the spread of diseases, including AIDS.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Government of Australia having ratified the UN Convention of Women remain consistent in its obligations to uphold the Articles of the Convention and request the Victorian Government to immediately repeal the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984.

       Pensions: Assets Test

      </para>
      <para>
       That the Hawke Government's failure to correct the anomalies arising from the application of the assets test on pensioners, with the failure of the Australian Democrats to support Senator Messner's Bill to repeal the assets test, is causing unnecessary hardship for Australia's aged, particularly those living in rural areas.

      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Imports of frozen peas from New Zealand and elsewhere have increased from 4.8% of the Australian market in 1979-80 to an estimated 20% in 1984-85-from 2.2 million kgs. to 8.0 million kgs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As a result of these escalating imports, in 1985:
      </para>
      <para>
       Growers are faced with cuts of up to 30% both in contract tonnages and prices,
      </para>
      <para>
       Hundreds of jobs in the processing industry will be lost, with many hundreds more under threat in downstream industries,

      <para>
       Millions of dollars will be lost from sensitive regional and State economies.

      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore request that: the Australian government:

      <para>
       (1) Reject the recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission Interim Report on Frozen peas that no assistance be provided to the industry.
      </para>

In relation to the payment of $240,000 to Dr Armstrong, which is described as being compensation for restraints and releases, what are the restraints and releases for which Dr Armstrong has had to be compensated almost one quarter of a million dollars? Is the purpose of this payment related in any way to fear on the part of the Government that Dr Armstrong may have confirmed the criticisms and accusations made by Mr Ranald Macdonald about the extravagant waste and improper expenditure by the Australian Bicentennial Authority? What guarantee is the Government prepared to give, if Mr Reid is removed from his position as in some way being responsible for this fiasco, that the public purse will not be ripped off once again in order to blackmail or purchase him into silence?

In the course of that Estimates committee I tabled a letter, at the request of Mr Reid, from the firm of solicitors, Allen Allen and Hemsley, which set out the substance of the negotiations between Allen Allen and Hemsley, acting for Mr Reid as Chairman of the Authority, and the solicitors for Dr Armstrong. At this moment I am unable to go further into the details of that transaction which was conducted entirely by solicitors, other than to refer to the contents of that letter which I think is reasonably explicit. I remind honourable senators in the context of this whole matter that the Chairman was in the position of negotiating with Dr Armstrong or any senior employees of the Authority whose position was terminated. That was established by the legislation set up by the Fraser Government; it was not a matter in which the Government was directly involved. I am unable to comment, without examining the legislation, on guarantees in respect of the chairmanship of Mr Reid and the hypothetical situation which Senator Puplick addresses in his question about the possibility of Mr Reid's function as Chairman being terminated at some stage.

         â€”As I have said in this chamber on a number of occasions in the last few days, I am quite unable to discuss in detail the contents of the tax package to be announced this afternoon. I repeat that. Nonetheless, on the basis of the White Paper which was published prior to the taxation summit, there has been much speculation about proposed tax changes, much of that speculation inaccurate and some of it close to the truth perhaps. I can say that the tax package will represent a major reform of the tax system in this country designed to inject a much greater measure of equity and fairness.

        Honourable senators will recall that that was one of the aims of the Government prior to the publication of the White Paper.

I repeat, as I have said in this chamber before, that this Government has taken on the issue of tax reform-something the Opposition failed to do in seven years of government, during which there was an increased distortion in the taxation system, growing every year.

         â€”I will tell the Opposition about its attempts. First of all, in 1977 it promised people a fistful of dollars in terms of taxation and it took it away four months later. The Opposition's second attempt was to introduce tax indexation, which it abandoned a year later. That was the sort of performance the Opposition put on when it was in government in terms of taxation reform. The point is very simple. The suggestion I made earlier in the answer to this question is true-nothing of any significance at all was done about the taxation structure in that seven years of government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I will illustrate the point I have just made with some hard data, which is always unpalatable to the Opposition. The present tax structure has been allowed to grow with increasing inequities at marginal tax levels for 15 years or more. The top marginal rate of 60 per cent now cuts in at 1.6 times average weekly earnings, whereas in the mid-1950s the top tax rate cut in at income levels approximately 18 times average weekly earnings. Income tax assessed to individuals earning more than 1.6 times average weekly earnings, that is, now about $35,000 a year, accounted for half of total tax for individuals in the mid-1950s, whereas the comparable upper income ranges now account for only 20 per cent. That is a fact which has led to the debate about the desirability of tax reform in this country over a number of years.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the fringe benefits area there has been an escalating loss of revenue, possibly now around $700m a year. Those Opposition senators who look at the White Paper will see a graphic graph showing the escalation of fringe benefits in the Australian community in the last two or three years-something like a 25 per cent increase in that period. These perks are concentrated on higher income groups and reinforce the belief in the community at large that the tax system is unfair. One has only to look at the long lunch syndrome, which has been increasing in this society over the last few years, to understand the sorts of inequities which are apparent to people on lower incomes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Valder, the President of the Liberal Party, in July this year referred to fringe benefits as a disease. He went on to say that it was a disease which had developed over the last 10 years. He might have said a pestilence, when one looks at the increasing level of tax evasion which developed in that period. Mr Valder went on to say that it was a fair and just thing in this country if moves were made to reverse the trend towards fringe benefits. The Government agrees with that. As I said at the beginning of this answer, it is not possible for me to give details of the tax package at the moment, but the rumour that there will be some limitation on fringe benefits installed into the tax system is, of course, correct.

         â€”It is not necessary that either of those suggestions made by Senator Peter Baume at the conclusion of his question is right or wrong. I certainly would not wish to say that TEAS students are receiving too much. As Senator Baume will be aware, our Government has increased the level of TEAS every year that we have been in office and we have committed ourselves to increasing it over the next three-year period. I hope that the increases will continue after that. Senator Baume will also be aware of the position in regard to students at the Film and Television School because the same situation prevails now as prevailed under the Fraser Government. Those students are regarded as trainees rather than regular undergraduate students. In many cases they are not undergraduates; many already have degrees or have had years of work in the industry before being selected through a highly selective procedure to be students at the Film and Television School. The fact that they are paid a training allowance of about $7,000 a year indicates that they are similar to the category of trainees who receive training allowances in excess of TEAS through various programs run by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. I would not like to say whether they receive too much or too little, but I would suggest that our Government, presumably like the Government that we followed, was prepared to make a distinction between regular undergraduates, many of them coming straight from school, and industry trainees, which is what they are at the Film and Television School, many of whom have had substantial work experience and already have tertiary qualifications.

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to examples where the new definition of `day patient' has caused severe hardship and much inconvenience to families meeting costs of private hospital day care? Is it a fact that the new day benefit of $80 does not cover genuine instances of greater cost and has led to changed procedures such as patients, even children, being discharged immediately after midnight to avoid payments for higher gap expenses or patients being admitted the evening before the procedures are planned? Is it also a fact that if very sick patients are admitted at, say, 10 a.m. and die by 10 p.m. or 11 p.m., the total basic table benefit is still $80 which goes nowhere near meeting the cost of the intensive care provided? Will the Minister for Health review the `day' definition and reconsider an eight-hour or 12-hour stay being sufficient to allow higher reimbursement from the funds and the payment of a patient bed subsidy, now avoided by the Commonwealth, so as to relieve out-of-pocket expenditure of $100 or more?

The American veterans commenced that process several years ago, and some Australian veterans, assisted by legal representatives in Australia, were permitted to join that action as a result of some evidence placed before the American courts. A sum of $180m was awarded to the Vietnam veterans, of which $1.8m was made available to Australian veterans. The difficulty the American judge had was that submissions were then placed before him by the Returned Services League of Australia as well as by the Vietnam Veterans' Association, and he was naturally perplexed as to how he would distribute that sum, which will shortly reach, because of interest, approximately $2m.

        It was of some concern to me that he was in an indecisive state of mind as to what steps he could take to have the matter placed properly in the Australian system so that Australian veterans could profit from his decision. It was an out of court settlement and no liabilities were accepted by the American drug companies. Finally, I was able to prevail upon the RSL and the VVA to come together in a trust arrangement. Arising out of those negotiations representatives from those organisations, plus Legacy and the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, were invited to participate in the establishment of that trust, with the Minister of the day appointing a neutral chairman. I then selected Mr Justice Meares, himself a veteran, and that trust has now been registered in the Australian Capital Territory. I understand that the American judge, Judge Weinstein, has agreed to distribute the funds to that organisation. The terms of reference will be a matter that will be discussed by the trust, on the understanding that it will not distribute the funds on a strictly welfare basis-because that is the responsibility of government-but will come up with recommendations upon which the funds may be equitably distributed to those veterans needing assistance beyond the compensation and welfare systems in Australia.

        Money supply figures, whether for M3, M6, M1 or any other measurement of money supply, were always imperfect measurements of what was actually happening. The simplistic notion which originated in Chicago in the late 1960s that price movements were directly determined by changes in the volume of money was always theoretically suspect. It was always logically unsound and has now been empirically discredited, to the point where hardly any serious or respected economist, with the possible exception of people such as the former Secretary to the Treasury, who floats around somewhere in the political spectrum between that range occupied by the far Right and the lunatic fringe, any longer takes the Friedman monetary theory seriously. That was always the case. Since the financial system has been deregulated within the last 12 months the changes in the monetary aggregates have been even less reliable than they have ever been in the past and, in particular, should not be compared with changes in the same money aggregates before the system was deregulated.

       SOUTH AFRICA: DETENTION OF DR BOESAK

         â€”Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to a report in the Press on 16 September 1985 in which it was claimed that South African churchman, Dr Alan Boesak, detained by the white South African Government for the past three weeks, is now expected to be charged with subversion? Is not this just another of a long series of attacks against the United Democratic Front, of which Dr Boesak is a patron? How does the detention and probable trial of Dr Boesak conform with the statements emanating from the Pretoria Government and its diplomats abroad, that liberation for blacks and coloureds is in the air in that beleaguered country? Will the Australian Government protest against the detention of Dr Boesak, which is clearly yet another blow against well-minded South Africans who require nothing more than equality of opportunity and equal voting rights for all citizens of their country regardless of race, colour or creed?

         â€”I am aware of a report in the Age of 16 September that Dr Boesak, who is the President of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and a very prominent anti-apartheid leader in South Africa, is now expected to be charged with supervision. I note that in the report the Age itself was unable to confirm the report of the particular charge. As of the date of my brief, which is three days ago, the Australian Government had received no such actual confirmation. Reaction to reports of the detention and charging of Dr Boesak in any respect is as follows: As Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs I, on 28 August, strongly condemned the arrest of Dr Boesak and of 26 other black leaders. It is apparent that the intention of the South African authorities is to remove these opponents from political life and from peaceful political opposition. This is to be unambiguously condemned. We see the detention of Dr Boesak as representing just another example of the South African Government's continuing intolerance of legitimate political expression and its continuing failure to take concrete action to open negotiations with representative black leaders. The South African Government's repressive actions do not, and could not, contribute to an easing of tension, nor could they help in any way to achieve a peaceful resolution of South Africa's problems.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has recently expressed its continuing concern over the South African Government's failure to enter into negotiations with the black community. On 3 September, it will be recalled, we did call on the South African Government to release political prisoners as an essential step towards dialogue and easing tension. The South African Government's actions demonstrate its continuing intolerance, as I have already said, of legitimate political opposition and, by means of detention over an extended period, its determination to stifle and to intimidate extra-parliamentary opposition and to stifle public constitutional reforms. I believe and this Government believes that its actions serve only to highlight the inadequacy of constitutional changes to date and they really do quite seriously undermine the South African Government's claims of a commitment to genuine reform.

I ask the Minister: Firstly, does he accept Mr Coonan's criticisms that the Government's assistance to the inventors scheme is inadequate in that it may help fund the development of a prototype, but fails to assist with the protection of the prototype so developed? Secondly, is there a need for a greater co-ordination and simplification of government support measures for inventors? Thirdly, is it not a matter for concern that Mr Coonan's invention, with its possible invaluable paramedical application, may be sent overseas to gain effective prototype protection and development?

         â€”I am aware of the publicity surrounding this matter in the Adelaide Advertiser and also in some other papers. It is true that Mr Coonan applied for support under the assistance to inventors scheme in July 1984. The application was assessed by the South Australian inventions advisory panel and the panel recommended to the Department in April 1985 that $12,400 be made available for prototype development. In 1984-85 a substantial backlog had developed in relation to inventions recommended by State panels for support under the assistance to inventors scheme. In May 1985 I declared a moratorium on the acceptance of any further applications under the scheme and approved payments for speeding up the processing of the backlog within an additional 1984-85 allocation of $500,000 and a further $250,000 in 1985-86. In other words, we halted the new applications and tried to get rid of the backlog by an additional allocation of money.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The arrangements for processing the backlog involved the commissioning of a commercial feasibility analysis for each recommended invention with available funds to be allocated to assist those inventions which the respective analyses showed had the highest commercial prospects. The Department has advised that currently there are on hand a considerable number of inventions considered to have high commercial prospects relative to the remaining funds which have been allocated. There has been some doubt about the value of Mr Coonan's invention relative to other inventions which have been competing for support. The situation has now been clarified and the Department will shortly be seeking Mr Coonan's agreement to proceed to commission a commercial feasibility analysis for his invention. It is considered that preparation of such an analysis would have benefits in identifying the value of pursuing development of the invention with or without Federal Government assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        In concluding, I also note that the future of the assistance to the inventors scheme is subject to a decision which will be made in the context of the proposed national industry extension services initiative. Nonetheless, whatever happens in respect of the future of that scheme, Mr Coonan's position is as I have described it in my answer.

In Western Australia an unforseen enthusiasm for co-operative planning seems to have been demonstrated. I understand that last week a joint statement was issued in Western Australia by the State Minister and me announcing a series of projects under the scheme. Unfortunately, something must have happened to the system because I did not know about the joint statement being released. I assume that it was just enthusiasm by the local State Government. I am sure that there would not have been any attempt by members of the Western Australian State Government to get an early release of the statement for any political benefit of their own.

       <para>
        Last year an unmatched grant of $10m was provided under the home and community care program. Some of that money was not spent in the year so we enabled it to flow over into this financial year. In this case, as in other States, the Western Australian Government has had the projects which it approved last year funded this year from that money. It is that money that the State Government was referring to in regard to the projects it announced last week.
       </para>

        It is unfortunate that the enthusiasm of the Western Australians has got in the way of our agreed planning processes and prevented us from making a joint announcement in the time-honoured way, particularly as I am going to Western Australia this evening so that we can sign the HACC agreement with the Western Australian Government tomorrow. However, I am sure that when I get to Western Australia the Western Australian Government will be sufficiently contrite about the terrible mistake it has made and will explain to me that it was just a mistake and a matter of over-enthusiasm and, of course, was not an attempt to jump the gun on the Commonwealth in these circumstances.

That information was then fully investigated and found to have no basis.

The retaliatory expulsion is much larger than had been expected. Because the United Kingdom has far fewer staff in Moscow than the USSR has in London it is disproportionately damaging to British interests. It will be recalled that the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, described the action of the Soviet Union as `totally unjustified' and bound to set back moves towards better relations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The British decision then to expel a further six Soviet personnel who allegedly were also involved in intelligence gathering is an indication of the United Kingdom Government's anger-we believe legitimate anger-over the Soviet response. Despite the Soviet Union's retaliatory action in then expelling a further six British personnel, it is clear now that the British Government wishes this to be the end of the matter and it has stated that it will continue to work to improve United Kingdom-USSR relations. the Australian Government hopes that this incident will not have any lasting adverse effect on initiatives to improve the climate of East-West relations. At present, there do not seem to be any direct implications for Australia in any of these events.

Letters were sent to all beneficiaries of my Department, about 600,000, and at the end of August all but 10 per cent, about 59,000, had accepted the direct credit system.

Of course, that process provides those who come within those categories with the option of not having direct credit applied to their regular payments.

I think it is unfortunate that someone who is the Minister for Welfare Services in Queensland should make such remarks because I believe that, even in a government like the Queensland Government, one would hope that the Minister for Welfare Services would be a little more tolerant and show a little more compassion for these unfortunate victims of our inequitable society.

         â€”One reason we need not take Mr Muntz's remarks very seriously, and I think Senator Chipp should know this, is that `deviant' is one of his favourite words. Almost everyone south of the Queensland border, but particularly politicians, is a deviant. At various times he has said that members of the Queensland Liberal Party are deviants. He has certainly said that the unemployed are deviants. He has a real obsession about those people who he thinks are deviant. He treats them in a way to back up those words. For instance, in Queensland Mr Muntz has introduced an assets test on those who are to receive emergency relief or assistance with aids for the disabled, which means that anyone who has more than $5,000 in assets misses out. Of course, at the same time he complains about our very generous assets test on pensions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As Senator Colston mentioned in a question to me recently, Mr Muntz has failed to provide the sort of assistance for the unemployed in Queensland which is provided in other States, in the belief, I think, that people in this unfortunate situation should not receive government assistance. However, of course, he and his colleagues are quite happy to provide government assistance for the sons of Premiers who need water for their farms. They have no problem with the Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Racing providing a Totalizator Administration Board licence for members of his family.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a strange attitude by Mr Muntz-an attitude which comes out in his description of people as deviants. This morning I heard him admitting that certainly he did call them deviants but that he did not mean to. He got upset about the Press describing it as that. If we were all in our political utopia, we would all be reported on what we meant to say and not what we did say. Unfortunately, Mr Muntz uses terms like this frequently. He obviously has no compassion for the disadvantaged in the community. He has no compassion not only for single parents but also for the unemployed, of which Queensland has a higher percentage than any other State. I am afraid that Mr Muntz is just another clone of the Queensland National Party in that Party of clones. I am afraid that, until the Government in Queensland changes, people such as single parents will cop the sort of abuse they have copped from this gentleman recently.

         â€”No one can guarantee that any organ is absolutely AIDS-free, but the precautions that have been taken in Australia have been such with transplantations, and particularly with blood transfusions, that we probably have by far the best record in the world in this regard. Quite clearly, when a surgeon is to use an organ for transplantation, he will make every effort to ensure that the donor does not suffer from AIDS or any other transmissible disease of that type. This can be done by knowing the family history of the person and whether the person is in one of the high risk groups, et cetera. I dare say that occasionally situations will arise, as I think happened recently in Britain, in which the choice is between someone dying and someone having something like a heart transplant. Then, in consultation with the patient, some risk may be taken in that regard. I assure Senator Elstob that the state of the game in Australia is such that anyone having an organ transplant or a blood transfusion can be guaranteed that absolutely every care is taken and that the chance of transmission of the disease AIDS in such circumstances is extremely low indeed.

         â€”In response to the last part of the question, the answer is unequivocally yes; a wages freeze policy cannot be implemented without a centralised wage fixing authority. Indeed, the notion of collective bargaining and a wage freeze is a contradiction in terms, although that is a fact apparently not yet grasped by the present crop of ideologues leading the Liberal Party, who are so unaware of the meaning of words, the realities of life or whatever that they simultaneously advocate the discounting of wages and free collective bargaining, when it ought to be self-evident that the two cannot co-exist. To discount wages effectively there has to be a centralised wage fixing body with some authority.

       <para>
        The Liberal Party, during its last term of government, particularly in its last two disastrous years in government, swung from one end of the spectrum to the other on wages policy. It announced its policy of free collective bargaining in the middle of 1981 which touched off a wages explosion of 13 per cent in one year and 14 per cent in another. It generated the highest unemployment that we had seen since the 1930s, the worst economic slump since the 1930s and the highest interest rates of all time and it destroyed a quarter of a million jobs in just 12 months. Then, 18 months later, observing the results of that handiwork, the Liberal Party had sufficient sense to abandon the free collective bargaining idea and institute a wages freeze, which was at the opposite end of the wages policy spectrum from that which it had followed previously. Unfortunately, that is a lesson which the Liberal Party, under its present leadership, appears not to have learnt.

Senator Chipp's first two questions related to whether the Australian Government had inquired how French agents managed to `escape' from Norfolk Island. There is little I can add to the answer I gave on Monday, 16 September, that the alleged French agents did not escape from Norfolk Island. They were questioned on the Island by New Zealand police and no charges were laid against them.

        The next question from Senator Chipp was whether police have questioned the Frenchman who met Maninguet, a possible French agent, at a Sydney cinema, as reported twice in the National Times. The answer to that is no, there has been no request from the New Zealand authorities to question the person named.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remaining question was whether, in the light of these various alleged Australian connections and the new story in Le Monde, the Government is now willing to conduct a thorough inquiry into all of these possible connections. The answer to that is that the Australian Federal Police has co-operated fully with New Zealand authorities in their inquiries into this matter. The honourable senator should appreciate that the AFP would have no basis for making inquiries in Australia except in relation to breaches of Commonwealth law or in reponse to requests for assistance from overseas agencies. I might add, in the light of Senator Sanders's question to Senator Button today, that the Prime Minister last night made a statement on the role of the Australian intelligence community in the Greenpeace affair, which was accurately reported in the Age newspaper this morning to the following effect:

         â€”Honourable senators will be aware that even at this stage of the Budget sittings less than satisfactory progress has been made in the Government's legislation program. Bills from the autumn sittings have yet to pass the Senate. At the current rate of progress additional sitting days will be required to permit the essential legislation on the Government's program to come before the Senate. Honourable senators will recall also that during the first week of the Budget sittings I undertook to have early discussions with Senators Chaney and Chipp to work out how the Senate could avoid sitting for a prolonged and concentrated period at the end of the year. I met with Senators Chaney and Chipp, and parties represented in the Senate have had an opportunity to look at options for extending the sittings.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It has been agreed to amend the original sitting pattern as follows: Instead of rising for three weeks following the sitting period in October, the Senate will rise for only two weeks, meeting again on 5 November and sitting until 14 November. The Senate will then adjourn for one week, returning on 26 November for another two-week sitting period. Some additional sitting days may be required should progress on the Government's essential legislation be unsatisfactory. The sittings for the House of Representatives remain unchanged.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say that there have been some expressions of view from various sources about this changed pattern of sittings. In terms of the statement I have just read, the Senate would be expected to rise on Friday, 6 December. At that point the Senate will have been sitting for one week after the rising of the House of Representatives. It is quite frequent, if not normal, that the Senate has to sit for two weeks after the rising of the House of Representatives. I alert honourable senators to the fact that it may be advisable to pencil into diaries the week commencing 9 December as being a week in which the Senate may have to sit. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a calendar indicating the revised sitting pattern.

         â€”by leave-I agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) that there have been discussions about this matter. I would quibble with the point that there has been agreement about the change, but certainly there was agreement that some change was required. The Opposition put the view, which Senator Button was unable to accommodate, that we should seek to keep the Senate and House of Representatives sittings in tandem as much as possible. We would have preferred that the House of Representatives sit also in the week commencing 4 November. Senator Button told me that it was not the Government's intention to re-arrange the sittings of the House of Representatives. There was agreement that it was highly undesirable that the Senate should sit for four weeks in row. We did that during the last period of sittings and I believe that it was a good illustration of why we should not do it. I believe that the strain on senators was excessive and, therefore, I am strongly opposed to sitting four weeks in a row. I would prefer the pattern which the Government is putting forward to any suggestion that we should sit for four weeks in a row. To that extent, there is agreement.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The difficulty the Opposition sees in what is now being laid down by the Government is that for Government Ministers, Opposition shadow Ministers and many other senators it will be necessary to be in Canberra for the week shown as an up week, otherwise we will miss respectively our Caucus and Party meetings and meetings of the Cabinet and shadow Cabinet. Therefore, effectively, for most of us it will mean five continuous weeks in Canberra. To anyone who is not a part of this Parliament, it sounds a particularly weak objection. Why should people object to being five weeks in Canberra? It is a very pleasant place. The reality of the periods of sittings that we have now undertaken is that there is a very considerable personal strain and I believe that it is extremely unhealthy, both for the operations of this place and for the operations of the bodies of senators and members.
       </para>
       <para>
        My other point is that there are mixed feelings within the Opposition about the two weeks on and two weeks off pattern. Personally I have always supported that as being a pattern which is in the interests of the Government, rather than those of the Opposition. As we plan to be in government more than in opposition, I therefore believe that although we are in opposition we should support the pattern. My concern is that while we retain significant breaks in both the winter and the summer, the two weeks on and two weeks off pattern does not work to full advantage. I wish to put on the record-not as an Opposition suggestion, but as one senator's suggestion-that if the two weeks on and two weeks off pattern is to work and if we are to avoid the sorts of extensions that we have seen since the Government instituted the pattern, we really need to sit more continuously through the year with relatively short breaks both at Christmas and in the middle of the year. I commend that for the Government's attention.
       </para>
       <para>
        For my part, I will support sittings which may be in the interests of the Government in the sense that they give an opportunity for the more orderly use of time by Ministers and by the Cabinet-and I believe we should be ready to acknowledge the needs of the Cabinet and its Ministers-although I do believe that the Parliament itself is not getting a full advantage from the change because of the rush of legislation at the end of sessions, which is unsatisfactory to us all. I am sorry to take the time of the Senate when we wish to adjourn, but I wish to put those views on the record as matters which need consideration from the Government side as well as from the Opposition. I regret that we will be sitting without the House of Representatives. I think that it reduces the effectiveness of this Parliament.

         â€”by leave-I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) for his courtesy in putting this matter down at this stage. Being a Party that is represented in only one House, the Australian Democrats have sympathy with the point of view that Senator Chaney has put forward. We see that there are very good reasons why the Liberal Party would want the Senate to meet when the House of Representatives meets. However, the arrangement proposed is far better than that which obtained last year, provided that we get through the business. I want to sound a note of warning: I do not think we have a bolter's chance of getting the business through, even with this schedule. We have passed virtually only one Bill plus some rural Bills so far. The progress we have made is minimal, in view of the Government's legislative schedule. That is nobody's fault.

        The problems arise from debates on matters of public importance and papers. I do not begrudge the Opposition the opportunity to bring up matters of public importance. It is the Opposition's duty to do so and I am 100 per cent in favour of that. However, I have taken particular notice of the matters of public importance that have been brought forward on non- broadcast days. For example, on the first day we came back Senator Messner brought forward a matter of public importance-I cannot remember what it was about; I could not really understand it anyway-

         â€”Yes. I got my staff to check afterwards and it did not get one line in any newspaper in the country. That is a very important point. I suggest that there might be a gentleperson's agreement between all parties in this chamber that we have two matters of public importance on a Wednesday, on broadcast day, or on the other broadcast day that we get sometimes. This would at least ensure that proceedings of the Senate are being heard by somebody. The gentleperson's agreement would be not to call matters of public importance on other days. At the moment the way in which the Opposition or the Australian Democrats can call matters of public importance on non-broadcast days means that there are only eight hours a week in four days in which government business can be dealt with. We have six sitting weeks left, so that means we have 48 hours of government business left before 6 December. It is crazy to think that we can get through the legislative program that was put forward by Senator Button earlier in the session, even if the Government knocks a few things off the list, which it always does near the end of a session. I see a recurrence of the situation in which intolerable strain is put on members of this Parliament by sitting for perhaps four or more weeks straight before Christmas. That is a situation to which we should not subject people. I do not have a cut and dried answer to the problem, but at least I have put forward one suggestion which I would ask honourable senators to consider.

         â€”by leave-I wish to make three points briefly. First, I hope that the Government has considered the effect that this sitting pattern will have on the staff of the Parliament, particularly if the House of Representatives does not change its sitting pattern. As I see it, this would mean that the catering staff and others would be here for quite an extended period-say seven or eight weeks. That is my guess. Secondly, I agree with the need for an extended sitting of Parliament, not only to deal with government business, but also to deal with private members' business. For example, I have not pressed any claim for private members' time for perhaps a year or more, although on the Notice Paper there are matters that I have put forward for debate in this Parliament and there is a significant Bill dealing with a matter of major public policy to be determined by the Federal Parliament. My third point is about the date on which we return-5 November. We have not been told what time we are to sit on that date. It would be most interesting to hear that because there is an event in Melbourne on 5 November.

         â€”by leave-I wish to comment briefly on Senator Harradine's remarks. First, in relation to the staff, we inquired about the staff and we were told that, as long as adequate notice was given, that is a quite satisfactory arrangement. I am absolutely appalled by Senator Harradine's suggestion about the Melbourne Cup. Senators such as Sir John Carrick and I have been here for a long time and we are very concerned about the decline in public morality and the work ethic in this community. We sat here year in and year out while the Melbourne Cup was on. If one wanted to hear it one had to vacate one's seat and go out and listen in the passage. There was hardly a senator in the place, but we did not stop work in all those years. Now that Senator Harradine is suggesting it, he puts himself at the spearhead of the decline of the work ethic and we will have things to say to him about that in the next few months. I am sure that an appropriate arrangement can be made for those honourable senators who are desperate about that question.

       <para>
        Apart from that, I have had three suggestions this morning from honourable senators who have spoken on this issue. Senator Chaney suggested that we should sit for longer periods in the year. What he is seeking to attack with that suggestion is the tradition we have in sitting patterns in the Australian Parliament which were laid down in the early part of this century when members came by steamer from Fremantle to Sydney and then by train from Sydney to Canberra if that was appropriate. That pattern of sittings has remained. I agree with the radical proposition which Senator Chaney has put forward; I do not know whether anyone else does. I think we should look at sitting a little longer in the middle of the year and having less rushed sittings at other times. I will seek to have that suggestion examined by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chipp made a number of useful suggestions in the same category about rearranging matters of public importance and things of that kind in order to try to get rid of some of the clutter we have in our program and give more time to government business, private members' business and so on. If I might reveal the contents of a private conversation that I had with Senator Harradine when discussing this matter, he said that he would prefer not to sit at all. That may be a position which has some appeal. I commend the proposition to the Senate.

       That the Senate take note of the letter.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are told in a letter, signed by the Secretary to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Telephone Interceptions, that senior counsel assisting the Commission has asked for the transcript of evidence taken in camera by the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge to be made available on a confidential basis. I say at the outset that I would be reluctant to take such a step other than in response to a request from the Royal Commissioner himself. I regard it as inappropriate that the Senate should consider the release of such material except where the Royal Commissioner himself attests to the necessity.
      </para>
      <para>
       Putting that to one side, as one reads the letter it becomes apparent that senior counsel assisting the Commission is seeking the transcript of examination of a member of the Australian Federal Police to see whether any discrepancy or omission may be found between what that witness told the Senate Committee and what he has told, or indicated he intends to tell, the Commission. This is to establish whether he is being fully truthful and withholding nothing of relevance in his evidence before the Commission. It seems obvious that it may be intended to test that matter by comparison with the prior statement given before the Senate Select Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       It will be apparent to honourable senators that this immediately gives rise to the sorts of considerations that you, Mr President, outlined in your statement to the Senate on the use of parliamentary committee evidence in court proceedings. It seems to me that it would be a dereliction of duty towards witnesses and of regard for itself for the Senate to forward evidence given before any one of its committees to this Royal Commission when the Senate cannot be sure of the interpretation and scope which the Commission might attach to article 9 of the Bill of Rights. No one in this chamber can be sure what interpretation would commend itself to the Royal Commission, whether that of the President, as submitted by amicus curiae to certain criminal trials in New South Wales recently, or that of the trial judges in those trials.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators will be aware that Mr Justice Murphy has submitted certain grounds of appeal, including matters very relevant to the sorts of considerations that you raised in your statement to the chamber, Mr President. Until a final judicial interpretation of the application of article 9 emerges from that appeal process, and until the Senate and the Parliament have had an opportunity to consider that judicial interpretation, I believe prudence dictates that we refrain from responding to the request. I have moved, therefore, that the Senate take note of the request, emphasising that the Senate should neither deny nor grant the request but merely note it. I think it should be emphasised that the Senate should not thereby be considered to be setting itself against co-operating with the Stewart Royal Commission. Indeed, the speedy passage of legislation with perhaps too little debate to strengthen its operations is testimony to this chamber's desire that the Commission be effective.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the moment I believe we should abstain from responding to this request and simply pause to allow a more settled and assured interpretation of article 9 of the Bill of Rights to emerge out of the tension which inevitably exists between the Parliament and the courts. Should the Royal Commissioner himself, when that point is reached, want to press the request upon us, we should consider it at that time.

        â€”Mr President, I agree with the remarks made by Senator Tate in relation to this request that has been received and which you have reported to the Senate. It is clear that for the Senate to accede to that request immediately would be completely contrary to the stance that the Senate has taken in relation to the ambit of the Bill of Rights and its application in these situations. Although that may be found by the courts of law to be a wrong interpretation as far as law is concerned, until that is resolved I think we should refrain from taking any steps in this matter. It may well be that before this whole matter is resolved through the court system some further urgency may be created about this request. The Parliament itself may move forward with its own consideration of these matters. But at this stage it is certainly premature to accede to the request and therefore I agree with the approach that has been proposed by Senator Tate in this matter.

        â€”Mr President, I support the comments that Senators Tate and Durack have made with regard to the request that we have received. Like them, at the moment I am not at all happy about agreeing to the request that was made, given that we still have an unresolved judgment quite recently put down by Mr Justice Cantor and given the comments too that honourable senators have made in this place pursuant to your statement on Mr Justice Cantor's decision. I, like Senator Tate, am concerned, as I think we all are in this place, about the need to protect witnesses. Until we sort out the problems that we perceive as having arisen from Mr Justice Cantor's judgment and the unresolved matter of article 9 of the Bill of Rights, to say nothing of section 49 of the Constitution, we will have to tread very carefully.

       I think matters are not helped by the fact that I found the request made to us rather open-ended, not to say somewhat vague, about just how far the Royal Commission of Inquiry into alleged telephone interceptions intended to proceed in gleaning and using information from what was, in effect, an in camera series of hearings by the first Senate Select Committee on Allegations concerning a Judge. Like my two colleagues, I would hesitate for a very long time before agreeing to any resolution of the Senate to make available the material that was asked for in that letter.

       The statement read as follows-
      </para>
      <para>
       The report which I am presenting to-day contains the Government's response in the form of the Department of Finance Minute, to the Committee's first report on Stratplan No. 225. It reports considerable progress by the Department of Social Security in the installation of computer equipment and in the provision of initial services to Departmental staff through this computer network.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, there are several matters dealt with in the Committee's first report where satisfactory responses have not been provided in the Department of Finance Minute. Since it is almost 12 months since the Committee last reported to Parliament on Stratplan's progress, the Committee is not proposing to defer tabling of the Finance Minute pending further and more satisfactory advice from the responsible departments and agencies. Instead the Committee has decided to proceed with the tabling of the Department of Finance Minute while noting these unsatisfactory responses and indicating the action the Committee is taking on them.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the principal matters which remain of concern to the Committee are:
      </para>
      <para>
       Project Costs and Benefits
      </para>
      <para>
       During the first phase of its inquiry the Committee was unable to obtain clear and confident information about Stratplan's current projected total cost, including all attributable staff costs. The latter would appear to be a substantial component of total project costs and one area where unanticipated system development and support needs have resulted in considerable cost escalation. The Committee recommended in its report that a review of total project costs be undertaken and requested a submission on this matter as soon as the review was completed. The Committee is still awaiting that submission.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee was also presented with mutable information about the benefits asserted to result from Stratplan and in particular the cost savings resulting from staff savings. The Committee does not refute that considerable benefits should flow from Stratplan in the form of improved client service, greater system reliability and more rapid implementation of Government initiatives. However the Committee was concerned that the cost effectiveness of Stratplan should be comprehensively reviewed so that cost savings in the form of staff savings, reductions in overpayments, and any other asserted efficiency improvements are fully characterised and quantified. The Committee is still awaiting advice on the results of the review of the project's cost effectiveness which it requested in its report.
      </para>
      <para>
       Project Financial Management
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee was informed during its public hearings that an on-line, computer-based financial management system for Stratplan was under development. The Committee considered that the completion of this system was vital to satisfactory budgetary control and the cost effective implementation of Stratplan. The response from the Department of Social Security does not state that the financial management system has been completed. In addition the Department of Social Security has indicated considerable difficulties in providing the Committee with current information on the precise costs incurred to date for Stratplan. The Committee is seeking prompt advice from the Department of Social Security as to why the system has not been completed and when it will be.
      </para>
      <para>
       Implementation Strategy and Contingency Planning
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee made several recommendations in Report 225 which presumed a phased introduction of Stratplan products whereby they would be tested andproven in New South Wales before being introduced elsewhere on a State by State basis. The response from the Department of Social Security indicated that this original implementation strategy has been changed, and that Stratplan products will now be implemented concurrently in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. No reasons have as yet been given for this change. The Committee is seeking advice on the reasons for this alteration. It is also requesting further advice from the Department of Social Security on the progress of the contingency plans currently being developed by the Department of Social Security, but which the Committee recommended to be completed before implementation proceeded beyond New South Wales.
      </para>
      <para>
       Use of Contract Analyst/Programmers
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Social Security has made extensive use of contract staff in the development and implementation of Stratplan systems. This has been justified in terms of providing access to specialised expertise not otherwise available, greater project management flexibility and a reduction in development times. However the use of contract staff has involved a considerable labour cost premium and may unduly compromise the development of the internal expertise necessary to support the long term maintenance of Stratplan systems. The Committee will be reviewing the overall cost effectiveness of employing contract analysts and programmers in Stratplan's continued implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee will be pursuing these and other outstanding matters through further submissions and hearings during the next phase of its monitoring and report on Stratplan.

         â€”I want to raise briefly a matter that I have raised previously in the Senate, and I shall not take very long to do it. It concerns a project that has been developed by Mr Andrew Helps, in Victoria, dealing with disaster management systems and his project, in particular, called CADMAS. He had sought funding for this project under section 39 of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act, and this matter was raised only this week on the program Four Corners, highlighting the importance of the project.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As we know, section 39 is a public interest section of the Act, and disaster management, whether it deals with bushfires such as we experienced a year or so ago in South Australia and Victoria or with floods, or anything else, is a very important subject. I have the advantage of having in my possession a minute paper which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, dated 22 February 1985, between the Secretary of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Technology and one of the first assistance secretaries, in which it was stated that the Minister for Science, Mr Barry Jones, had asked the Australian Industries Research and Development Incentives Advisory Council to reconsider financial assistance to Mr Helps. That minute stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . eventually it was agreed that the project should be funded.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Barry Jones made it very clear that he had, as a result of this, made a firm commitment to Mr Helps that the finance would be forthcoming and that any delays could prove risky, in that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the issue could become a political one in the Victorian election campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that the Minister at the table, Senator Grimes, will draw the attention of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, to this matter and ask him to examine it urgently, because this project is five years ahead of the rest of the world in this form of technology. I am anxious that this project, because of lack of government support with respect to continuing research funding, will disappear overseas. I know that an American company is interested in it. It recognises that the technology is leading the world. I ask the Government to consider urgently providing a grant under that section of the Act.

Last Thursday, Mr President, you advised the Senate that it was hoped that the Hansards of Senate Estimates Committees would be available on Monday. The Hansard for the Senate Estimates Committee relating to defence has not yet become available. This morning I could get no indication of when it may become available. This is, of course, of some significance, because there were some remarkably interesting responses to Opposition questioning in that Committee, the details of which it is important to me to have available. This seems to be an unreasonable delay, and as I understand it, Mr President, it relates to the introduction of new equipment at the Government Printing Office which is causing trouble.

       <para>
        This new equipment is also incompatible with existing equipment that enabled speedy retrieval of Hansard references if any honourable senator wanted to pursue a subject and to see the occasions on which it had been raised during debates here. As this new equipment is incompatible, that facility is not available this session, and it seems a significant withdrawal of a very useful service.

        On all these matters, Mr President, I think it appropriate that some kind of protest be made.

        â€”The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) To detail the cost of training and maintaining Service bands throughout Australia would be a significant task, requiring additional capacity, as the present resources management system does not separately identify all the actual resources utilised in specific functions. However, the annual cost for the actual salaries paid to personnel on the posted strength of full time Service bands is estimated to be $11.08m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Musicians are posted to serve in different establishment areas in accordance with Service requirements. In certain instances postings may occur in response to individual needs arising from compassionate grounds, personal preference or location for discharge. These requests are considered on their merit, and in conjunction with Service requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) At Townsville, there are two battalion bands and one, the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Band, has recently been supplemented to provide an enhanced capability. There are no plans for an increase in the number of Service bands, nor for the relocation of any band. The location of a band in a specific area is not dependent upon the number of Defence Force personnel in that area. The bands are located where they are best able to meet their primary role.

       A couple of things arise from that. I would be keen to see the Trade Practices Act when it is brought forward into revised from increase penalties and toughen up these kinds of breaches because they are, literally, rip-offs. There is no doubt about it and I am sure members of this House have heard of them occurring in their own electorates. These schemes are ripping off people in the Australian community who quite innocently are being caught by these purported journals. Interestingly, when we checked with the circulation ofAustralian Engineering Review we found that it circulates to about 35 people. All they do is send it to advertising agencies. It is not a journal-unlike the Bulletin, or whatever-that circulates widely through the community. It is just a rip-off.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other point I would like to make too, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that I believe that we, as a community, must now start to look seriously at prohibiting telephone selling. It would be impossible to stop people picking up telephones and seeking to sell things but I believe it would be quite possible, within the context of the Companies Act in particular and the Trade Practices Act as well, to suggest thatany purported contract entered into in such way would in fact be null and void; that if a contract is not entered into in the presence of the parties to that contract that contract would have no validity.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the sort of situation we aregoing to have to fact because clearly an increasing numberof these crooks areseeking totake advantage of good people who are going about theirnormal business. In this case we have got the clear evidence and in this case fortunately Mr Gifford and Mrs Gifford have no particular debt. But I can imagine many people who perhaps might be less aware, who are very busy and who might just get caught out.It is a matter that we are going to have to take up; it is serious matter and I would hope that we, as a community, can begin to address it urgently.

       The Government has decided tht from 1 July 1986 the tax-free threshold will apply only on a prorata basis in the case of those taxpayers joining the Australian work force on a full time basis for the first time and to those leaving Australia permanently. The full threshold will continue to apply to other taxpayers. This measure is expected to yield around $90m per annum from 1986-88.

       PRESCRIBED PAYMENTS SYSTEM
      </para>
      <para>
       Contrary to the alarmist claims made at the time of its introduction in 1983, the prescribed payments system has proved extremely successful in combatingtax evasion by contractors and sub-contractors in the building, transport, motor vehicle repair and cleaning and other industries. On the scheme's introduction, the 10 per cent deduction rate that currently applies to payments by the relevant industries was set on a conservative basis in order to facilitate its implementation. Having reviewed the arrangements, the Government has decided to increase the deduction rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent from 1 July 1986. As at present, those with a responsible tax record may apply to have this rate lowered where appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also from 1 July 1986, owner-builders are to comply with full prescribed payments system requirements by making deductions from payments in connection with construction projects in excess of $10,000 that begin after that date. The Government proposes to review further the operation of the prescribed payments system, including the desirability of extension to other industries. The net revenue gain from these changes is estimated at $105m in 1986-87 and $45m in subsequent years.

       QUARTERLEY PROVISIONAL TAX
      </para>
      <para>
       The existing system for the collection of provisional tax places stress on the money markets due to the substantial seasonal withdrawal of liquidity from the financial system in each June quarter. To overcome this problem the Government has decided to introduce an instalment system for the payment of provisional tax by individuals, to commence in 1987-88. When fully implemented four instalments will be payable.
      </para>
      <para>
       I emphasise that taxpayers will not be called upon to pay, in any financial year, a greater amount of tax than under the current system. Self-assessment procedures will continue to ensure that taxpayers will not be required to pay an amount which exceeds their estimated net tax payable for the year. The new system will not apply to taxpayers whose provisional tax liability does not exceed $2,000. Such taxpayers will continue to pay provisional tax on an annual basis, This will exclude about three quarters of a million provisional taxypers, about half of the total.
      </para>
      <para>
       An alternative pattern of instalment payments with later due dates will be available to taxpayers, such as some primary producers, whose income flow is concentrated in thesecond half of the financial year. The reduction insales of government securities that will result from this measure is estimated to generate interest savings of the order of $55m annually from 1987-88.

       QUARANTINING OF FARM LOSSES
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the most heavily used tax shelters set out in the draft White Paper is the write-off of farm losses against income from another source. The manner in which the tax system is currently structured allows other than genuine farmers to generate significant tax gains by directing investment to what otherwise would often be considered unprofitable ventures. The proposed measure is along the lines of that canvassed in the draft White Paper, but with significantly more generous treatment ofnon-farm income.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new rules will commence in the 1986-87 income year. There will be two approaches. The first will allow farm losses to be fully written off against non-farm incomes between $15,000 and $30,000. These thresholds will be subject to indexation.
