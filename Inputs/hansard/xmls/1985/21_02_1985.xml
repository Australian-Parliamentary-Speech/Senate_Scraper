      GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH
     </title>

      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       His Excellency the Governor-General entered the chamber and, being seated, with the President on his right hand, commanded that a message be sent to the House of Representatives intimating that he desired the attendance of honourable members in the Senate chamber forthwith.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable members having come with their Speaker, His Excellency was pleased to deliver the following speech:
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia:
      </para>
      <para>
       The 34th Parliament assembles following general elections on 1 December 1984 in which the people of Australia confirmed their choice of national direction by returning the Government with a substantial majority.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is pledged to carry out the clear mandate of the Australian people to build upon the achievements of its first term in creating a stronger, fairer and more equitable Australian society.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its first term of office the Government received the support and co-operation of Australians in embarking on a course never previously attempted in Australia during peacetime-a course of national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction. The Government is confident that the co-operation so essential for Australia's success will be maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the period since Labor won office Australia has experienced its strongest and most sustained economic performance for decades, the inflation rate has been brought down from twice the rate of other industrial countries two years ago to a level now close to the OECD average, and the unemployment rate has also been drastically cut during the period. At the same time the Government has created a strong momentum toward the change which is necessary to eliminate unemployment, poverty and inequality in our society.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is determined to maintain strong economic and employment growth with low inflation, to ensure that the benefits of a growing economy are fairly shared in the community, and to sustain the sense of national purpose that has returned to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       You, the members of the Parliament of Australia, have been called together to provide the legislative basis upon which the commitments made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government at the recent election will be carried out.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Economy
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's major task in its first term was the revival of the nation's economy. Economic policy was directed toward the simultaneous reduction of inflation and unemployment. The success of this approach in the past eighteen months has been clear. The economy has grown rapidly and the conditions have been established for further strong growth in the period ahead.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government intends to maintain the approach to economic policy which has been so successful in its first term of office. It will continue to pursue responsible economic policies which will lead to continued growth in the Australian economy, particularly in the private sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prices and Incomes Accord has played a crucial role in Australia's economic success. The Accord will continue to be the centrepiece of the Government's economic strategy and the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth. The Government maintains its commitment to the policies in the Accord and will give particular emphasis to the maintenance of an effective wage fixing system to protect real living standards whilst ensuring moderation in labour cost increases.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government proposes a major review of the Australian tax system during 1985. The Government has given the people of Australia explicit commitments regarding the budget deficit, budget expenditures and taxation. None of these will be increased as a proportion of gross domestic product in 1985-86 and over the Government's second term.
      </para>
      <para>
       The taxation review will be undertaken within the framework of the nine basic principles and objectives enunciated by the Prime Minister on 31 October 1984. These are designed to ensure that reform will make the tax scheme simpler, fairer and more efficient. An integral part of the taxation review process will be a National Tax Summit, with full community representation, to be held in the first week of July this year. The Government will also continue to give the highest priority to measures against tax avoidance and evasion. It will reintroduce the ''bottom-of-the-harbour'' bills rejected during the last Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will move further towards its objective of removing unnecessary controls in the financial system and increasing the efficiency of the financial and business sectors. The successful applicants for new banking authorities will be announced shortly. Legislation will be introduced if necessary to ensure the adequacy of arrangements for the prudential supervision of banks and insurance intermediaries following a review of existing provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The present arrangements for determining general revenue assistance to the States expire on 30 June 1985 and the Government will conduct a comprehensive review of Commonwealth-State financial relations early in its term of office. This will include a special Premiers' Conference in May of this year in addition to the regular June Premiers' Conference and Loan Council Meetings.
      </para>
      <para>
       Employment and Industrial Relations
      </para>
      <para>
       The Community Employment Program was launched in August 1983 and by December 1984 nearly 57,000 jobs had been created under the program.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the current financial year up to 65,000 people will be assisted under the Community Employment Program. The possible extension of the program in the private sector will also be explored.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conjunction with State and Territory Governments, a New Enterprise Initiatives Scheme will be established on a pilot basis during 1984-85. This will enable unemployed people with viable business propositions to be eligible to receive continued income support for up to a year while they establish their own small enterprises.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government remains deeply concerned at the disproportionate share of unemployment which is borne in Australia by young people. In its first term the Government undertook a range of specific measures to improve youth employment prospects. These included greater support for apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship training, work experience opportunities, and community youth support programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now, on the basis of recommendations received from the independent Committee of Inquiry, chaired by Mr Peter Kirby, the Government intends reforming labour market programs to give greater emphasis to improved training and work skills development. Particular emphasis will be given to providing broad skill-based training as one way to improve the opportunities open to our young people in the labour market, and especially for young people who have experienced prolonged unemployment or who are otherwise disadvantaged. The Government will be undertaking extensive consultations with State Governments, unions, employers and other groups concerning the implementation of policies in this area.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, the Government will give high priority to reforming the industrial relations system in the light of the report of the Hancock Review into Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems and to implementing a comprehensive national occupational health and safety policy. Legislation will be introduced to establish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission on a statutory basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       Community Welfare
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government believes that economic growth is not an end in itself, but a means to greater ends-a means towards the achievement of high social goals of equity and fairness. On the basis of the strong economic growth achieved, the Government during its first term provided low income groups with substantial additional assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Unemployment benefits for single adults were increased by over 25 per cent. There has been a real increase in pensions, and the tax burden on low income families, including pensioner and beneficiary families, has been reduced.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its coming term the Government will continue to give a high priority to improving the living standards of the most needy in the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       Reflecting the priority the Government attaches to ensuring more equitable access to a range of community services the Government has established a new Department of Community Services which will ensure that services are equitably distributed and better co-ordinated with those of States, local government and community groups. Those requiring special assistance will have greater access to the resources of our society.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its second term of office, the Government will ensure the maintenance of the Medicare program which has extended health services and an insurance system to all Australians on a fair, affordable and stable basis. The Medicare levy of 1 per cent of taxable income will not be increased during the Government's second term. Medicare will be extended to provide reciprocal health care arrangements for countries with which Australia has close ties.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has demonstrated its firm commitment to the veterans who have served this country. A comprehensive review of the Repatriation Act and associated legislation is nearing completion which will consolidate and clarify the present complex series of Acts. The new legislation, to be introduced in the Autumn Sittings, will not adversely affect current beneficiaries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government regards a sound housing and construction industry as an important social and economic objective. It will continue to give priority to this sector. The highly successful First Home Owners Scheme will continue and the new ten year Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement will make a direct attack on housing related poverty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Education
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is convinced of the primary importance of enhancing the quality of education at all levels of the education system in Australia. The Government is already committed to directing greater financial resources to the education sector to meet this need.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is committed to providing both government and non-government schools with substantial real increases in funding over the next eight years. The forthcoming report of the Quality of Education Review Committee chaired by Professor Peter Karmel will be an important further step in developing the Government's policy of using education funding to produce the most effective and highest quality education system possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Measures which the Government has already introduced to improve resource levels and increase participation and equity in tertiary education will be continued. The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission will soon report on measures to further increase tertiary participation and on ways to improve tertiary education output in terms of employment related skills.
      </para>
      <para>
       Industry Development
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government remains committed to developing a strong and competitive manufacturing industry. In its first term long range plans for the revitalisation of the steel industry, the passenger motor vehicle industry and the shipbuilding industry were set in place.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will continue to formulate positive policy approaches to industry development. One of our objectives is to build closer links between industry and research, so that Australian industry gains the greatest benefits possible from the work being done by the CSIRO and tertiary institutions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The major review of business regulation which is already underway will be carried through. The Government will thoroughly examine current and proposed law and regulations, liaise with State Governments to harmonise regulatory regimes and implement deregulatory procedures as soon as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Primary Industry
      </para>
      <para>
       The revival witnessed in the last two years in the rural sector has emphasised the important contribution it makes to the general level of Australia's economic activity and, more specifically, to Australia's export earning capacity. A major report on primary industry to the year 2000 will be developed this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will continue to place great importance on the rapport it has achieved with rural communities, industries and their representatives. The Government will soon meet with the executive of the National Farmers Federation to examine increasing farm costs. The Government will also continue its vigorous efforts to secure and further develop overseas markets for Australia's rural producers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Measures will be taken to assist the restructuring and revitalization of industries such as fishing, sugar and dairying which are facing long term, market related, structural difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       Trade
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's export performance in recent decades has declined significantly. Our trading prospects now, particularly in commodities, are uncertain. New forms of protection and export support are proliferating around the world, food self-sufficiency is increasing and increased competition in minerals and manufactured exports is coming from developing countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is determined that Australia will be in a position to meet this challenge by targeting particular markets and products and, through co-operation with the countries in our region, seeking ways to reduce barriers to trade and promote the interests of the people of the Pacific region.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recognising that growth in world trade is in manufactured goods and services, the Government will continue the steps being taken to ensure the close integration of our trade and industry policies which is needed to reflect these changing opportunities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Resources
      </para>
      <para>
       In its first term the Government established the Australian Coal Consultative Council and the Iron Ore Consultative Committee. Changes to the coal export duty have assisted the coal industry, and improved taxation arrangements have allowed mineral exploration to be deducted from income from any source, a measure which has benefited all mining and mineral industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its second term the Government will continue the support which it has given to petroleum exploration and development in offshore areas. The Government will introduce legislation to establish a resource rent tax to apply to new petroleum developments offshore in place of royalties and excise which would otherwise apply. The Government will introduce a cash bidding system for highly prospective petroleum areas in the territory of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and will hold discussions with the States with a view to introducing the new tax regime in other offshore areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will also introduce Nuclear Non-Proliferation Safeguards legislation and create a successor to the Atomic Energy Commission.

        Mr President, in so far as the judge, the subject of the report, is facing committal proceedings in the Castlereagh Street Court of Petty Sessions on 4 March, I think it would be most imprudent for any discussion of the report to be undertaken by honourable senators. Mr President, I know that you would, if the occasion arose, draw attention to the bundle of principles constituting the sub judice rule, but those of us with experience in this chamber know how quickly even apparently cautious remarks can ignite a firestorm of controversy. This is an occasion for utmost restraint in the interests of securing to the judge that atmosphere in which the judicial proceedings can proceed untainted by any remarks made in this place. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —by leave-The Select Committee on Allegations Concerning a Judge was established in response to very serious problems which confronted the Senate following the tabling of the report of the first Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge. As the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The issues concerning the Government and Senate arising out of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge are about as serious as could possibly be imagined.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, the first Select Committee had received evidence from Mr Briese, the Chairman of the Bench of Stipendiary Magistrates in New South Wales, who made very serious allegations against a High Court judge, Mr Justice Murphy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The issue before the Senate, difficult and all as it was, was made more complex by two other factors: The first Senate Committee was divided about the conclusion to be drawn from Mr Briese's evidence before it and submissions had been made to the Committee by the senior counsel for the judge that the judge was entitled to be accorded treatment in accordance with the rules of natural justice. The first Senate Committee had not been able to accede to this submission, particularly the claim that the judge's senior counsel should be entitled to cross-examine Mr Briese on his allegations, because of the existing Standing Orders of the Senate. All parties were agreed that, in the words of the then Attorney-General, 'Further action of some kind needs to be taken to clear the air', but the Senate was divided about the nature of that action.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition and the Australian Democrats were of the view that an independent parliamentary commissioner should be appointed to conduct a hearing in accordance with the principles of natural justice and to make findings of fact which would be reported to the Senate for its further consideration of the problem. The Government, however, believed that the evidence before the first Senate Committee and other relevant material should be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether a prosecution should be launched. Furthermore, the Government refused to co-operate in the appointment of an independent commissioner which would have required legislation, and in the absence of such co-operation that particular option was not open.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the event, therefore, the Senate established the second Select Committee, which was given the power to appoint commissioners who would participate in the Committee's deliberations and report their findings to the Committee. This was a novel procedure for the Senate to adopt and a further step in the development of the Senate's powers and the committee system which has been such a notable feature of parliamentary life for more than a decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Doubts were entertained in a number of quarters about the formation of a committee in this form, and indeed, the proponents of it readily conceded that it was a second best procedure. It was, however, the best procedure open to the Senate, given the lack of Government co-operation. The proceedings of the Committee, which heard evidence from a number of witnesses in public and accorded the highest principles of natural justice to all those concerned with its deliberations, not only dispelled those doubts but must now be accepted as a notable achievement by the Senate, regardless of what judgment may be made about its findings and recommendations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition accepts that, in view of the charges which have now been laid by the Director of Public Prosecutions against Mr Justice Murphy and the committal proceedings which are about to commence in respect of those charges, no comment should be made about the Committee's findings at this stage and indeed while the judicial process is taking its course. Furthermore, the Opposition does not believe that it is an appropriate time to debate the subject at all and does not propose to do so at this time. Nevertheless, the Opposition has at all times maintained and continues to maintain that the ultimate question at issue in this matter-namely, whether a Federal judge has been guilty of proved misbehaviour justifying his removal from office-is one for Parliament and Parliament alone to decide. As Senator Durack put it, speaking on behalf of the Opposition in the Senate on 4 September 1984:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the responsibility for this issue rests with the Parliament. It does not rest with the courts. It certainly does not rest with the Executive. It rests with the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a matter of comity between the Parliament and the courts and in the interest of according full justice to Mr Justice Murphy while his case is before a court, Parliament should desist from giving this matter any further consideration or seeking to discharge its responsibility. It is fundamental to our system of criminal justice that a person charged with an offence is entitled to a fair trial and should not have that right compromised.

However, as the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown, has said, the constitutional issue arising from the power and responsibility given to the Parliament under section 72 of the Constitution is quite different from the issue of Mr Justice Murphy's trial on the offence with which he is charged. This responsibility of the Parliament, as the elected representative of the people, cannot be waived and will remain, irrespective of the outcome of the trial. When Mr Justice Murphy's trial is concluded, the Opposition will consider what further parliamentary proceedings, if any, it should take.

         —by leave-The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chaney, has outlined the story which lies behind the report of the Senate Select Committee on Allegations Concerning a Judge. During the debate in the Senate prior to the establishment of the Committee I stressed, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, the Democrats' determination to ensure that Mr Justice Murphy was granted every possible right in accordance with the principles of natural justice. At the same time we accepted that it was essential for the Parliament to fulfil the heavy responsibility placed on it under section 72 (ii) of the Constitution. The lengthy negotiations which took place and the variety of options which were considered by members of the Senate before the second Select Committee, with its commissioners and counsel, was appointed have already been covered. The result of that Committee's hearings is printed in the report tabled in the Senate today.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At this stage I do not want, nor do I think it is appropriate, to canvass the conclusions arrived at by the members of the Committee and the commissioners assisting the Committee. We had specific terms of reference, and we were asked to make findings on specific matters. We did so. In view of the fact that charges have now been laid against Mr Justice Murphy by Mr Temby, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and that the hearings are due to begin in a few weeks, I endorse the comments made earlier with regard to the need to avoid commenting on the issues at this stage. Nor do I believe it is appropriate or even fitting to canvass what might happen in the future with regard to this matter. Without for one moment resiling from the responsibility placed specifically on the two Houses of this Parliament in section 72 (ii) of the Constitution, I can only repeat what I said on behalf of the Australian Democrats last December:
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter is now in the hands of [the courts] and must be left to the due processes of the law. Any Parliamentary debate before the [determination of] the Judge's innocence or guilt could well be prejudicial to a fair trial and no responsible House of Parliament or member of a House of Parliament should even contemplate it.

      <para>
       That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 11 January 1985, of the Rt Hon. Sir William John McKell, GCMG, AC, a former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1947 to 1953 and Premier of New South Wales from 1941 to 1947; and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sir William McKell was born in New South Wales on 26 September 1891. He had a very full, long and productive life which encompassed all the formative years and the most momentous events of a modern epoch of Australian history. He left school at the age of 13 and became an apprentice boilermaker and formed, at a very early age, an apprentices' union. He was subsequently a union official for some time and was then elected to the New South Wales Parliament in 1917. In his early days during his period in the New South Wales Parliament, which spanned 30 years, he studied law and was called to the Bar in 1925. He held several ministerial posts in Labor governments. He became Leader of the Opposition in 1939 and was Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales from May 1941 until his resignation in 1947. He was Governor-General of Australia from 1947 to 1953.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sir William McKell had a remarkable career of service to the Australian Labor Party, to the Parliament of New South Wales and to the people of Australia. His premiership of New South Wales embraced the entire period of the war in the Pacific, while his years as Governor-General covered the years of the post-war transition. After the burden of the war years and the two most difficult of the immediate post-war years, Sir William McKell proposed to retire into private life at the early age of 56. At that time he had no expectations that he would be appointed as the second Australian-born Governor-General. He could not have anticipated the wrath and hostility the appointment caused in certain quarters, a resentment almost incomprehensible to most of the present generation of Australians. It is a mark of a man that the tremendous personal integrity, natural dignity and strength of character McKell brought to his office as Governor-General converted all but his most ardent detractors into admirers. In the discharge of his office as Governor-General he adhered scrupulously to the fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy that the Governor-General acts on the advice of the elected government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Labor Party had a great servant in Bill McKell. He was a great party man, a great Australian and a great democrat. He was a patriot and he had great faith in the people and future of his country. He enjoyed that faith and belief in the future of this country and an active interest in public affairs until quite recently before his death. It was a remarkably long life, a remarkable career and a great contribution to this country. I am privileged to be able to move the motion which I have moved.

        —The Opposition joins with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and other Government senators in supporting this motion. Sir William McKell made a remarkable contribution to Australia over a very long life in a range of ways. I suppose that in an era when the position of Australian youth is under considerable scrutiny and when there is a lot of concern about the future of many young Australians, it is worth looking back on the life of Sir William McKell and seeing that in a way he represented what we would hope Australia would be for all its citizens. He was a man who had left school when he was 13, who took on an apprenticeship and different forms of studies and who was admitted to the Bar and became a Queen's Counsel. He served in many different ways. He was a very great success in many different ways.

       He left a lot of political monuments. I understand that he established the State Housing Commission, the University of New South Wales and the Kosciusko National Park. I suppose they are all institutions which are likely to be with us for a very long time. As I understand it, it is quite true that his appointment as Governor-General in 1947 was attacked. It is perhaps also true that the attitude of his Labor colleagues was not quite as charitable in 1951 when he acceded to the request for a double dissolution which was made by the then Prime Minister. Perhaps that also is a useful reminder to us that the contentious matters of any particular year look less contentious in retrospect and perhaps there is some evening out in these matters.

      <para>
       My only personal contact with the late Sir William McKell really was quite indirect; we shared a common car driver in Sydney-Mr Andrew Donaghey. He expressed the greatest devotion to Sir William McKell. I really feel I got to know Sir William quite well through Andrew Donaghey, including the various periods of illness Sir William had over the last few years. The affection that that man expressed for Sir William McKell is, I suspect, the sort of respect Sir William McKell would have wished to have from the Australians he served. The Opposition expresses to the family of Sir William McKell its respect for him and its wholehearted support for the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in this place.

In my view he was a person who saw many significant reforms.

        —As a senator from New South Wales I wish to associate myself with this motion of condolence for the late Sir William McKell, a remarkable Australian and one of the great Labor Premiers of New South Wales. Sir William McKell was born in 1891-the year in which the Australian Labor Party was formed. During his lifetime he saw the Labor Party emerge as the major political force in New South Wales. The Labor governments that he led clearly established a style and an agenda for all future New South Wales Labor governments. McKell was directly responsible for fashioning Labor's 1941 electoral triumph, and subsequent electoral triumphs. For example, his selection of local identities such as Billy Sheahan, Jack Renshaw and Eddie Graham, to name but a few, to run for the Labor Party in rural seats proved enormously successful.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The years of McKell Labor government were responsible for many lasting reforms. Chief amongst them included an expanded workers compensation Act, a new factories and shops Act, a lay-by sales reform Act, a hire purchase Act, a money-lenders Act and pensions for miners at the age of 60. The McKell governments were also responsible for performing massive civil airport and road construction works in New South Wales. In addition to those reforms McKell was a great conservationist. In 1943 McKell was directly responsible for claiming one and a quarter million acres of the Southern Alps for the Kosciusko National Park. Bob Carr, the New South Wales Minister for Planning and Environment, in a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald, noted:
      </para>
      <para>
       It was the first great conservationist battle and McKell was the first significant environmentalist in politics.
      </para>
      <para>
       The McKell legacy is afforded special prominence by the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party through an annual lecture named in his honour. The inaugural speech was delivered by the Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, in the presence of Sir William in 1982. Unfortunately, ill-health prevented him from attending the 1984 lecture delivered by the noted Australian author, Thomas Keneally. However, the lecture will continue to highlight the memory of Sir William and his distinguished career for many years to come.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I again refer to the words of Bob Carr, who said of Sir William:
      </para>

       His career had demonstrated that in politics a single individual with good values could make a difference. Hike to the peak of Kosciusko and look across the Alps. What memorial could beat that.

       That the Senate records its sincere regret at the death of Mrs Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India, and expresses deep sympathy to her family in their bereavement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, I ask that this motion, when carried, be conveyed by you to the Government of India. The death of Indira Gandhi was a tragic and wanton act of terrorism which was deplored and regretted by all Australians. Mrs Gandhi was one of the great leaders of our time. She was the head of the world's largest democracy and she guided India's progress, against huge odds, in the fields of agriculture, manufacturing and science. Today India has one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a strong technological and manufacturing base and having achieved a notable degree of self-reliance in agriculture. India has become a major force in international affairs. Under Mrs Gandhi, India assumed the leadership of the non-aligned movement. Mrs Gandhi, at the time of her death, was Chairman of the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Indira Gandhi enjoyed the greatest admiration and respect. Her strength, courage and ability will be sorely missed by the people of India and the absence of those characteristics will be noted throughout the rest of the world. Shortly before Mrs Gandhi's death, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) invited her to visit Australia. That was not to be. Perhaps the result of the recent election in India indicates something of the feelings of the Indian people. I do not wish to place interpretations on that result but perhaps it can be seen in some ways as a mark of respect to the life of Mrs Gandhi. The Government hopes that the new Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, will be able to take up the invitation to visit Australia extended to the late Mrs Gandhi. I know that all honourable senators will join me in expressing profound sympathy at India's great loss.

Like the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), the Opposition deplores the circumstances of her death. It is a matter of intense regret that the leader of one of the great democracies should meet her end in such a way. Mrs Gandhi had a long and distinguished career. It was a career which was sometimes controversial and a matter of some debate. It is significant to note that after what was perhaps the most controversial period of her reign she lost government. I suppose the best test of all of whether one operates in a democracy is that when one governs in a way which is unacceptable one is rejected by the people. Mrs Gandhi was out of office for only a short time and was re-elected and served as Prime Minister until her death. The Opposition joins with the Government in expressing sympathy and regret at the death of Indira Gandhi, and I agree with the sentiments which have been expressed by Senator Button.

It was clear that she had very firm views on certain matters and she was able eloquently to express those views and to meet many of the arguments that were put forward in discussions at that time. When any leader of any nation meets such a fate, particularly a leader who was attempting to ensure that democracy be maintained in a wide and diverse community, it is a sad thing for all democracies. As such, I believe that it is particularly appropriate for the Senate to support this motion and to pass on its condolences to the Indian people.

        —Major-General Robert Hurley Wordsworth was a senator from 1950 to 1959. 'Wordy', as he was known to many of those who knew him in his later years, earned two mentions in dispatches as well as a CB and a CBE during his long period of service in both the Australian Imperial Force and the Indian Army. He was born at Collarenebri in New South Wales in 1894 and died last year in November, a resident of Longford in Tasmania, at the age of 90. He is survived by his widow, a son and a daughter.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It would be true to say that he had both a long and a distinguished career in Australia, as soldier, farmer, parliamentarian and civil administrator. He joined the AIF at the outbreak of war in August 1914 and embarked for the Middle East in September that year. He spent his twenty-first birthday at Gallipoli. In Egypt he served with the Light Horse and participated in the Battle of Beersheba, which saw the world's last great mounted charge. He later transferred to the Indian Army and served in, among other places, Afghanistan. In the Second World War he served in the Middle East in Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Lebanon as a major-general in the Armoured Corps, and received significant acknowledgment of his services, having been mentioned twice in dispatches and having been awarded the CB and CBE. He retired to Tasmania in 1947 on the independence of India, and in 1949 was elected to this chamber as a representative of the State of Tasmania. Perhaps as would be expected with such a background, he became known in this place for his interest, expertise and contributions on foreign affairs and defence. He was notable for looking after the interests of returned servicemen, and in the sphere of international relations, especially in South and South East Asia, he was one of the first parliamentarians to warn of Soviet ambitions in South East Asia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Major-General Wordsworth was involved in and concerned with the development of the Colombo Plan. He laid great stress on the interdependence of the West's defences against the Soviet Union, and it may be regarded as of some significance that he was a great supporter of the importance of ANZUS. He did not at any time forget that he was a representative of Tasmania and put that State's economic interests well to the fore. He was a keen advocate of shipping and was aware of the problems of the timber industry. In 1959 he retired, again to farming, and in 1961 was elected President of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He served in that capacity until appointed in 1962 as Administrator of Norfolk Island. Later he came home again to Tasmania and ultimately retired to Longford where he lived quietly, proudly watching his son David enter farming and, later, a political career in Western Australia, where he has been a Liberal MLC since 1971 and was a Minister from 1977 to 1982. David Wordsworth also served the party organisation in both Tasmania and Western Australia.

        —I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chaney, and supported by Senator Peter Rae. I wish to speak, first of all, about former Senator Robert Herbert Lacey, universally known as Bert Lacey. Former Senator Lacey was a long time servant of the Labor movement of this country and the Australian Labor Party in particular. He was formerly an organiser in the Australian Workers Union, having worked in many occupations, particularly in rural areas, in construction work, in mining and in other activities of that type. He was an organiser in that union until 1947 when he became General Secretary of the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Labor Party. He remained General Secretary of my branch of the Party until he entered the Senate in 1965. He was for a short time a member of the House of Assembly in Tasmania, representing the seat of Denison. Those were the days when general secretaries of the Labor Party had a difficult time because of lack of resources and the lack of remuneration attached to the job. Bert Lacey kept that job from 1947 until 1965. It was a difficult and onerous job, and he did it well.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Even to those who had differences with him, he was a forthright man of strong views. After he left that position, which was the time I first became active in the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party, he certainly had no hesitation in letting his views be known to those of us who were active in the Party, particularly those of us who became members of parliament. I used to say to him that he never lost his capacity to use the telephone, and he often gave his views very vigorously on the phone to me and, I am sure, to other members of the Party. Even when we differed with some of those views, we respected them very much. People on both sides of this House knew Bert Lacey. Like many others, I regret his passing at the age of 84. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in giving condolences to his surviving relatives.

I met him after I had become a senator when he used to stay, and in fact for a short time lived, in the town of Legana in Tasmania where I lived. We first struck up an acquaintance because we were gardening and he quickly told me what I was doing wrong with my gardening, as he was likely to tell people about any subject that he had views about. He then discovered that the person he was talking to was actually a senator and he gave me his views on the Senate and senators he had known. When he found out which side of the Parliament I was on he told me exactly what he thought of my political views and of the views of my colleagues. He was a forthright man. As Senator Peter Rae said, he obviously served this country well and was respected throughout Tasmania during his years of service. I support the words of Senator Rae and join him in giving my condolences and, I am sure, the condolences of all honourable senators on this side to his relatives.

        —by leave -Although my Leader moved a motion in relation to both former senators, I wished Senator Grimes to speak first in relation to Robert Herbert Lacey, or Bert Lacey as he was known. He was a senator for Tasmania from 1965 to 1971 and he died in November last year at the age of 84. I had the pleasure of serving in this chamber with him for three years. As I knew him both here and generally in relation to politics in Tasmania, he was a quiet, gentle man but, as Senator Grimes has said, he was a very firm contributor both to his Party and to his constituents. He was a firm contributor to his union members when he was the Australian Workers Union organiser from 1938 to 1946 and General Secretary to the Australian Labor Party from 1947 to 1965, to the electors of Denison when he served as a member of the House of Assembly and later to the electors of Tasmania from 1965 to 1971.

       As I recall Bert Lacey's interests in this chamber, he was particularly interested in the welfare of his fellow man. Social services and the care of Commonwealth prisoners were two of the things to which I recall his paying particular attention. He expressed his concern in relation to the Vietnam War, a matter of considerable concern to many people in the period during which he served in this chamber. He also, like former Senator Wordsworth, did not forget his duty to look after the economic interests of Tasmania. He was particularly concerned about shipping. He was a quiet man of dignity who served his fellow man throughout his long life. Opposition senators join in paying tribute to the lifetime of dedication to public welfare displayed by Bert Lacey and in expressing our condolences to his widow and his family.

        —I also join in the condolences in respect of Major-General Wordsworth, whom I did not know. I express my condolences to his relatives and to the relatives of Bert Lacey, whom I knew very well and who was a very close and personal friend of myself and my family. Bert Lacey was born on 12 January 1900 at Maryborough in Victoria. He had four sisters and a brother. Bert's mother died giving birth to her sixth child and Bert became virtually an orphan. He was raised in extremely hard conditions and was provided with scarcely enough food to sustain him. He attended the Central Training School in Ballarat. He was so small and thin that the boys at the school nicknamed him 'Spider'. His family recalls the story of one of his teachers, who would often ask Bert to deliver messages to the teacher's home, knowing that his wife would reward Bert with a few slices of cake.

      <para>
       By the time Bert was 12 years of age he was working after school on a dairy farm milking cows. Those who are best qualified to know say that Bert's childhood included periods of deprivation, hunger and bullying, so much so that at the age of 16 he weighed only six stone. His older brother served in the First World War and Bert was very anxious to serve as well, but his guardian refused to give permission for Bert to enlist. In January 1918, on Bert's eighteenth birthday, he joined the Army but the war was almost over so he did not serve overseas. After the war he returned to farm work in the Jamieson area in Victoria. The hours, of course, were long and hard.
      </para>
      <para>
       Bert then got a job at a gold mine at Woods Point, Victoria, working above ground. Here he became friendly with a couple of Italian miners who taught him how to box to defend himself. During the 1920s Bert went to Tasmania and worked at the Mathinna gold mine. He became engaged to Mary Emmeline Clark. The former mine manager from the Woods Point gold mine went to New Zealand and asked Bert Lacey to join him, so Bert and Mary were married in 1926 and went to New Zealand. Before too long the mine failed and Bert went to work in the timber industry and he and Mary lived in a logging camp. Two years later they returned to Tasmania for the birth of their first child.

       Bert Lacey worked at the Storeys Creek mine as a tool sharpener. However, during the Depression that mine closed and Bert was thrown out of work. It was then that his second child was born. He then went gold sluicing. About this time he became interested in politics and the trade union movement. When he found some miners were being underpaid he suggested that they join a union. The mine boss called Bert an agitator and threw a few punches at him. Bert's training from the Italians proved very useful and the mine boss soon found Bert was more than able to defend himself. Some years later that man went to Bert for help over a compensation claim and Bert worked hard to get him his rightful dues. That was typical of the character of Bert Lacey.
      </para>
      <para>
       Bert's mining experiences included open cut tin mining at Goshen and underground mining at Rosebery. It was on the west coast of Tasmania that Bert worked with Eric Reece and was appointed a union representative for the Australian Workers Union. When a union organiser was needed by the AWU on the north-west coast in 1938, Bert was appointed to that position. The west coast organiser at that time was Eric Reece and they both became active in the Australian Labor Party. While Bert was the AWU organiser on the north-west coast he was living in Ulverstone and his two youngest children were born there.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1946 the ALP endorsed two AWU organisers for the Darwin electorate, which is now known as the Braddon electorate, for the House of Assembly election. Those two AWU organisers were Eric Reece and Bert Lacey. Bert lodged his nomination for the election at the electoral office in Devonport but, on his way back home to Ulverstone, was involved in a collision with a motor car. Bert was travelling by motorbike, which was the form of transport provided by the AWU at the time for its organisers. His injuries were very severe indeed and he spent five months in the local hospital unable to take part in the election campaign. When it was suggested in 1946 that his leg should be amputated, Bert was transferred to Hobart. However, doctors managed to save his leg. As a matter of fact, last year, a few months before his death, Bert had part of a leg removed. That election in 1946 saw the entry into the Tasmanian Parliament of Eric Reece, who went on to become the Premier of the State. No doubt Bert Lacey also would have won a seat on that occasion had it not been for the road accident.
      </para>
      <para>
       The leg injury meant the end of Bert's work as a union organiser. In 1947 the Tasmanian branch of the ALP decided for the first time in its history to appoint a full time State secretary, and Bert was selected for that office. He held that position for 18 years-until 1965, which was the year he took his place in the Senate. A successor in that office was Kath Venn. One of my regrets is that Kath is not here to pay tribute to Bert.

       During all the years in which Bert worked as General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, the Labor Party was successfully returned to office in Tasmania on each occasion on which it faced election. That was so in most cases, of course, so far as his successor was concerned. Bert was a very loyal and conscientious servant of the Labor Party. As money was always in short supply, often he had to wait for his salary.
      </para>
      <para>
       Bert was a candidate in no fewer than eight parliamentary elections, but usually circumstances were against him. Following the 1946 House of Assembly election in Tasmania, Bert stood at two further House of Assembly elections. In 1956 he was a candidate for Denison but just missed out on winning one of the seats. In early 1959 a sitting member retired from the House of Assembly. As is the case under the Hare-Clark system, a recount was required to fill the vacancy. Bert Lacey was declared elected at the recount, but before he could take his seat in Parliament the Premier called a State election and Bert lost out again.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1954 the ALP endorsed a candidate, Bill Hannon, for the Denison seat in the House of Representatives. About 30 minutes before nominations closed, Bert Lacey, as the General Secretary of the Labor Party, checked with the various electoral offices to make sure that the Labor Party candidates had lodged their nominations. He was informed that Bill Hannon had not done so. A frantic search took place to find Bill Hannon, who had apparently set out early that morning door-knocking in the electorate. When it seemed obvious that the endorsed candidate would not be found before the time for the closing of nominations Bert Lacey dashed into the electoral office and lodged a nomination for himself so that the Party would be represented at that election. Despite the lack of preparation for the campaign, Bert polled extremely well but failed to win the seat which was held by the redoubtable Athol Townley. Four years later the ALP was unable to find anyone willing to lodge an application for endorsement for the Denison seat so obligingly Bert contested the seat again. Once again he polled very well, but not well enough.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1955 the Australian Labor Party endorsed three candidates for the Senate: Senator Nick McKenna, Bert Lacey and Bob Poke-in that order. This is an indication of the type of person Bert was. He was actually a member of the Australian Labor Party Executive at the time and he felt that perhaps he had been given second place by reason of that fact. Therefore, he told the Executive that, in fairness, because he was present when the vote was taken, he thought his name and that of Bob Poke should go in a hat and the name of the No. 3 candidate should be pulled out of the hat. Inevitably Bert's name was drawn out of the hat and so at the Senate election Senator Nick McKenna held his seat and Bob Poke was elected. Bert Lacey missed out again.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, in 1964, Bert Lacey contested and won a seat in the Senate. He served his electors unstintingly for six years from the time he took his seat in July 1965 until 1971. In 1970 Bert Lacey was awarded life membership of the Labor Party. He was also a life member of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. During Bert's time in both those organisations I knew him very well and worked closely with him. Many other people would understand his firm and gentle advice, which was always given directly and which was clear and concise. I always found it to be very worth while.

      <para>
       Bert was a true family man, a devoted husband for 58 years. He raised a family of three daughters and one son and also raised two of his grandchildren. As has been said, he had a great interest in prisons and voluntarily worked for many years with the St Vincent de Paul Society visiting various prisons. Bert was generous and kind-hearted and would share his last dollar with anyone in need. He once bought himself a lottery ticket in the days when the first prize in Tatts was #12,000. He visited his mother-in-law and gave her the ticket. It won first prize and no one was more delighted than Bert Lacey. One of his great qualities was his ability to remain calm and unruffled and at peace in his own mind no matter how great the stress or strain in his personal life and no matter what provocation there was in his political life.

I will not repeat the details of his service but I will point out that, as well as the things already mentioned, he served in the Australian Labor Party's Federal Executive, was Federal Vice-President in 1962 and was a delegate to the Federal Conference for seven years. He remained loyal to the ALP throughout the traumas of the 1950s split despite extreme pressure.

        —by leave-Dudley Erwin, who passed away on 29 October 1984 at the age of 67, served his country in several spheres over a period of more than 40 years. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record some of the achievements of Dudley Erwin during that period. I do so for a personal reason in that I was formerly-in 1975-elected to the seat of Ballarat in the other place in succession to Dudley Erwin who had been the member for Ballarat for 20 years.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Dudley Erwin served Australia very well, as I have said, in several spheres, starting with his war service during the Second World War. He was one of the Australians to join the Services early. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force early at the beginning of 1940. He served as a navigator in the south-west Pacific and rose to the rank of flight lieutenant. In June 1943, as a member of the No. 31 Beaufighter Squadron, he took part in one of that squadron's most successful raids of the Second World War. He was subsequently appointed area navigation officer for the north-west Pacific area in 1944, a position he held until his demobilisation after the war. After the war he retained a great interest in ex-servicemen from all walks of life. He was a very strong, staunch and long-serving member of the Returned Services League and was accorded life membership of that organisation. Until his death he was very closely associated with the RSL.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dudley Erwin was first elected to Parliament for the Federal seat of Ballarat in 1955. He was re-elected on seven subsequent occasions prior to his retirement in 1975. I felt that a great honour was accorded to me when I was chosen to succeed him as the member for Ballarat. During his 20 years of parliamentary service he served on numerous parliamentary committees. He served on both House and joint committees. In particular, during the period 1962-64 he was the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Commonwealth Parliamentary and Government Publications. He was the Government Whip in the House of Representatives from 1967 until 1969 when he was appointed Minister for Air in the Gorton Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following his retirement from parliamentary life in 1975 Dudley Erwin became the foundation president of the Australian Association of Independent Businesses Ltd. In that capacity he devoted several years to furthering the interests of small business in Australia. So it was a very rounded and full life of public service. On behalf of the people of Ballarat, whom he represented so faithfully for so many years, on behalf of the people of Victoria and, in particular, on behalf of Senator Austin Lewis and my other Victorian colleagues, I would like to convey to his widow, Gwenda, and his three children our deep sympathy at his passing.
