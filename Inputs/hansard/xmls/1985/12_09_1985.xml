       Sugar Industry

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That as a direct result of the adverse economic position in which members of the Sugar Industry find themselves, they request that a meeting be convened with representatives of the major sugar exporting countries of the world (Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the E.E.C.) to initiate meaningful negotiations to reach agreement on world sugar on policy and price.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, that both the State and Commonwealth Governments be requested to provide across the board assistance measures for Cane Growers by way of a guaranteed minimum average price as previously requested for Raw Sugar Production within Mill Peak in the 1985-86 Season.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should immediately seek to have urgent talks commenced at international levels to formulate a new International Sugar Agreement to be based on the existing production levels of the exporting countries adjusted by whatever percentage necessary to reduce the difference in World Sugar Stocks between supply and demand to within 25 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners most humbly pray that further the direct assistance to Cane Growers should be on a per ton of cane basis so as to bridge the difference between the price of cane actually paid and the price which Cane Growers would receive at the Sugar Price of $240.00 per ton 94NT.
      </para>
      <para>
       And further that unless financial assistance is provided in the short term the long term viability of many efficient producers will be sacrificed. If this happens the very fabric of communities along the northern-eastern coast will be destroyed.

       Nursing Home Benefits
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Without any warning and at the worst possible moment, the Federal Government has abandoned the pensioner patients in South Australia's Nursing Homes. These people are suffering undeserving hardship and trauma as a result of the Federal Government's decision to freeze the nursing home benefit levels in South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The pensioner patients and those on fixed incomes now cannot expect any relief from recent significant fee increases approved by the Department of Community Services and which have coincided with the decision to freeze benefits. 80-85 per cent of nursing home patients are pensioners and the majority are now required to pay in excess of their pension for their nursing care for the very first time. Some are paying over $5 per day on top of their pension. Many are looking for cheaper nursing care that doesn't exist.
      </para>
      <para>
       We request that the Federal Government:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. alleviate the distress of South Australia's nursing home patients and their families by effective restoration of the principle that pensioner patients should not have to pay more than their pension for nursing home care.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. restore the review of the benefit rates in November 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. resolve its concerns over health care costs with the South Australian Government rather than inflicting unnecessary suffering on nursing home patients.

       National Flag

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and the honourable members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses represents the Nation's historic origin and the source of its language and law.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. They recall that millions of native born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that your honour- able House will: Propose and pass a motion that ``the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum''.

       Northern Territory: Mail Service

I remind the Minister that Mr Justice Lockhart pointed out that what had been done by the union was as plain an example of criminal contempt as there can be. He pointed out that society simply cannot function if individuals, corporations or unions take this approach. Finally, he pointed out that if they got away with it, inevitably people would think there is one law for a trade union and another law for anybody else and the result unchecked would be anarchy. I ask the Minister whether this Government accepts that trade unions must abide by the law and accept the rulings of the courts? If it does, will the Government make its view clear to the Australian Council of Trade Unions?

I refer to reports that a certain French newspaper has remarked that the visit to Mururoa by the President of France, Mr Mitterrand, is a `message to Australia and New Zealand to mind their own business'. Is it not so that nuclear testing anywhere, and especially in the Pacific, is the business of Australia and New Zealand? Also, if newspapers such as the one referred to, and the French Government, do not see anything wrong with testing nuclear devices in the Pacific, will the Australian Government urge them to carry out their testing in France?

It is the case, as Senator Colston and the Senate will be well aware, that this Government has repeatedly stated its strong opposition to and, indeed, condemnation of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. That opposition is shared by all members of the South Pacific Forum and was reiterated at the recent Raratonga meeting, which, of course, resulted in the adoption and signing of a South Pacific nuclear free zone treaty which expresses the deep and abiding wish of all members that no nuclear tests be conducted anywhere in the region.

        It is the Government's position that if France is as genuine as it claims to be in its assertions that no damage in terms of radioactive pollution will follow from the carrying out of those tests, it ought to put its money where its mouth is and conduct those tests on metropolitan French soil. So to that extent I do endorse the comment made by Senator Colston in the last part of his question.

        Senator Lewis interjected in the course of my giving this answer. If I might say so, in a reflective moment this morning I happened to be listening to the Canberra radio and I heard Senator Lewis talking about the transport workers strike in the Australian Capital Territory. It was very interesting because Senator Lewis talked about sanctions and consequences and what should be done. He was then asked this question: `Senator Lewis, if that course of action was embarked on, would not a series of other unions come out in support of the Transport Workers Union and would not the industrial unrest spread?' Senator Lewis's answer was: `Yes, that may happen'. He thought for a moment and he said: `But I don't think it would'. That answer carries the implications of the industrial relations policy of the Opposition and how well thought out it is. Senator Lewis gave a classic example of that this morning in that particular answer.

         —As Senator Crowley said, Dr Blewett announced recently the establishment of two high level nursing committees, the National Nursing Consultative Committee and the Commonwealth-State Advisory Committee on Nursing Issues. The first Committee was established in response to representations to Dr Blewett from the nursing unions and from others in the profession. He invited peak association and professional organisations with a national perspective to nominate members to that Committee. Even though nursing is primarily a State responsibility, the Committee is to provide Dr Blewett with high level advice on nursing issues which have a national perspective which will enable the Government to keep the nursing profession informed of developments at a national level. The associations represented on the National Nursing Consultative Committee include the Royal Australian Nursing Federation, the College of Nursing of Australia, the National Council of Health Organisations and the Australian Congress of Mental Health Nurses. They will be joined by officers of the Commonwealth Department of Health. From time to time, the Committee also can call experts in various fields of nursing to advise on specific issues.

       <para>
        The Commonwealth-State Advisory Committee on Nursing Issues was an initiative of the Australian Health Ministers' Conference which met, I think, in May this year. Its formation also recognises the need for the nursing profession to have input at the highest levels of government. In particular, the Committee will advise the Council of Health Ministers on many issues, with particular emphasis on the nursing labour force in Australia, which, of course, is of great concern to us all. Industrial issues, nurses' education and the place of nursing in modern health care delivery also will be considered by the Committee. The Committee is made up of the senior nursing advisers to the State and territorial governments. They will be joined by leading State and Commonwealth Health Ministers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both committees will have their first meetings in early October. Initially, they will both be chaired by the Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Health, Ms Ann Kern. The actual working relationships between the committees will be discussed at the initial meeting of each committee in order to achieve a co-operative approach in matters which are largely State responsibilities but which have implications for the health care of us all and particular implications for Federal health funding. Working groups on specific subjects of nursing, such as education and work force, will support the committees as they require such assistance.

Is this possible role for Jervis Bay the reason why the Australian Capital Territory has not been declared a nuclear-free zone despite the passage by the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly on 17 April 1984-more than 16 months ago-of the Nuclear Activities (Prohibition) Ordinance? Does the Minister intend to continue to ignore the concern of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly?

Does the Minister recall stating on that occasion that the Government had under consideration youth employment policies which would go to that question? How will the policies which were announced in the Budget give youth their fair share of Public Service jobs? Can the Minister put a figure on the percentage of jobs that youth will have as a proportion of total Public Service jobs at the end of this financial year?

         —Senator Walsh is the Minister responsible. As I recall it, there has been some discussion of this matter in the context of the introduction of the Government's youth traineeship program which was announced last month. It is thought by the Government that that program will improve prospects for youth in employment in both the private sector and the public sector, and that, of course, includes the Commonwealth public sector-the Australian Public Service. All public employers will participate fully in that program of youth traineeships. As I recall it, one of the early areas of take-up in respect of traineeships was expected to be the Commonwealth Public Service.

         —Perhaps I misunderstood that aspect of the question. As I understand it, that was referred to. I can, if the honourable senator wants me to do so, make some comments about those figures. For example, it is said that there has been a decline in youth employment in the Australian Public Service, but a report by the Bureau of Labor Market Research noted that the proportion of permanent officers in the Australian Public Service aged under 21 years fell from 22.2 per cent in 1966 to 6.7 per cent in 1983-that is, over a 20-year period. It is said that there are very complex reasons for the decline. Part of it is due to the removal, almost 20 years ago, of the marriage bar; part to a substantial increase in the number of adults, both men and women, applying for base grade Public Service jobs; and part to changes in the growth rate of the Public Service and then the effect of staff ceilings and new technology on the availability of new jobs traditionally occupied by young people.

Insofar as there are some other factual matters in his question, I will seek an early answer and provide it as soon as I can.

I do not know whether Senator Walters has been on to a number of building companies suggesting to them that they make application for a junior rate in their awards. I would have thought that if they were concerned about that issue they would have done that.

         —There are a number of problems in Tasmania in respect of domiciliary nursing. An internal audit conducted by my Department revealed a number of problems in respect of domiciliary nursing. The main concern shown as a result of that survey was that there is an excessive cost problem. Whereas Tasmania accounts for 4 per cent of those who are eligible for domiciliary nursing care by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the costs exceeded 11 per cent of the national expenditure. On the basis of that, of course, we carried out further investigations. That has caused some minor problems in the determination of the Department to rectify an obvious problem of overservicing. This is a clear case where privatisation was in fact costing taxpayers an amount in excess of that for which the service could be provided. So the Department decided to provide the service on a temporary basis, pending negotiations with those providing the nursing services and with the Tasmanian Government. The Tasmanian Government has made certain proposals to me which suggest that it can provide the service at a rate comparable to that for which the private nursing arrangements are provided. Consequently, I have an inclination to vary the existing proposal so that the State proposition can receive some consideration.

       <para>
        It is pretty clear, of course, that if we provide home nursing and other aids to aged clients, which my Department has an obligation to provide, that is a far more preferable arrangement than placing people in institutions. However, it needs to be cost effective. We have taken steps to provide those arrangements on a permanent basis. I have a preference for the option of coming to an agreement with the State Government. Consequently, discussions have been held with my Department in recent times with a view to reaching an accommodation with the State, which already provides the service for community groups generally in Tasmania. I am hopeful that we will reach an agreement with the State Government to provide a service for which we will furnish the funds and it will provide the service on a much more preferable basis than has existed in the past.

         —Dealing with the last part of the question first, it is, of course, true that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer indicated certain anticipations about interest rates. In the 10 or 12 years in which I have been in this place I have seen that happen on a number of occasions. I do not want to remind the honourable senator of that because it would become a very long answer if I did so. The launching pad of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle's question concerned, of course, the forecasts of the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research. Let me say with regard to that body that it has a history of extreme pessimism in terms of forecasting. To illustrate that point, at this time last year the forecasts of that body were for only 3.1 per cent growth in gross domestic product and 4.2 per cent growth in non-farm GDP. The outcomes respectively were 4.6 per cent growth in GDP and 5 per cent growth in non-farm GDP. Its forecast of only 2.5 per cent growth in non-farm product in 1985-86 implies a fall during the year from the June 1985 seasonally adjusted level.

        In terms of the forecasts of that body, I have seen a summary of forecasts-I do not have them available to me now-by various organisations. None of those forecasts, as I recall, was nearly as pessimistic as the forecasts of this organisation. Of course, I remind Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle that since this Government was elected the Budget forecasts in terms of growth have been on target each year. The Budget forecast, again, is for a 5 per cent non-farm growth rate and the Government believes that it will be sustained. A number of other things follow from that point which I do not think I have to answer, because the whole question was predicated on the assumption that the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research forecasts were accurate.

The organisation went back to the council with a second proposition, which was again rejected.

The number of people receiving unemployment benefits at 30 August this year was 541,022, which is a drop of 2.3 per cent from 26 July, or a drop of 12,000 in that month. If we compare the figures of 30 August this year with those of 30 August 1984 we find that there has been a drop in the number of people receiving the unemployment benefit from 570,000 to 29,500, or 5.2 per cent. South Australia has the second best record of all the States. The best record for a drop in unemployment is, of course, in another Labor State, Victoria. In South Australia, the figures at 30 August 1985 compared with those of 31 August 1984 show a drop of 4,809, or 8.9 per cent. In Victoria, the drop has been 12.4 per cent. The only two increases in that time, of course, have been in Queensland with 2.8 per cent and the Northern Territory with 18.8 per cent. That increase will continue with the policies of the governments in that State and Territory.

        South Australia has a very good record as has Victoria. It certainly gives the lie to statements that I have seen in the newspapers in the last couple of days that the South Austalian economy is in some difficulty. In fact, the South Australian economy is doing very well as is most of the rest of the Australian economy, the only difficulties being in Queensland, the Northern Territory and, to a lesser extent, in my State of Tasmania.

How many indemnities have been recommended by the Royal Commissioner to date? How many have been approved by the Attorney-General?

We had a lengthy discussion about that. I was also able to explain to them that they were under some misapprehension if they thought that there had been any cuts in tertiary education. They were very pleased to learn of the significant increases we have been able to make in tertiary funding in each of our three Budgets, and of the consequences-over 25,000 extra places will be created in higher education institutions over the next triennium. They were also able to learn accurately the effect of the Budget on student allowances-all of which will increase.

It is perfectly understandable and right that student organisations should campaign for improvements in student circumstances, but their campaigns are much more likely to be effective if they are based on a factual understanding of the budgetary decisions that have been made by our Government. I think it is unfortunate that some people like to have campaigns based on misinformation. That, of course, misleads the students and causes them to waste their time. However, I think that after the exchange of information and views we had yesterday we will see a much more realistic campaign by students. I was pleased to wish them well.

In the Government's 1984 Budget changes were made to the Companies Act that allowed losses from particular companies to be offset against profits from the total group of companies. This has opened the door for corporate raiders to write off interest charges on money they have borrowed, mainly from overseas, against profits in both their own company and the target company. Such a technique was recently used in the Bond raid on Castlemaine-Tooheys. Does the Minister agree that these techniques now used by corporate raiders are essentially negative gearing, a practice which the Government recently outlawed for individuals? Is the Government aware that the present company law makes all companies, which wish to expand through increasing productive capacity and efficiency and by developing new markets and products, vulnerable to raiders who seek to expand through the easy, non-productive method of swallowing their competitors? Will the Government give consideration to legislation that discourages rather than encourages massive manipulation of the ownership of companies on Australian stock exchanges and the making overnight of massive multi-million dollar tax-free profits by individuals?

I do not know that the changes made to group taxation in the 1984 Budget provide the only, most favoured and most available vehicle for corporate raiders, as suggested in the question. I am not sufficiently across the taxation regime to say whether that is so. I am also not able to answer the technical question as to whether these arrangements are the same thing as negative gearing. I have expressed concern publicly about activities in the Australian market-place which have not amounted, in my view, to wealth creation but to wealth accretion in other ways-by company takeovers and so on.

         —As Senator MacGibbon said, this Government and previous governments have been concerned about fraud and overservicing in our health system. We have been inhibited in the past, as have other governments, by the lack of a capacity to determine the level of such fraud and to detect where it is going on. This is now being overcome as one of the side effects of the introduction of a universal health insurance scheme, which for the first time gives us the statistical information to enable us to home in on fraudulent behaviour. Only a very small number of doctors are involved, but those who do it do so in a big way, if the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts presented yesterday is to be relied upon.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As I heard Senator Peter Baume saying in a speech yesterday, if we have a situation in which an insurance system is provided-public in the case of Medicare or private in the case of other health insurance schemes-whereby the fee paid to the doctor is paid partly by another organisation, there is always the potential for fraud. There always has been, particularly in the pathology area, where larceny, as Senator MacGibbon has said, seems to have been going on on a grand scale. The difference between Medicare and a purely private system, as was demonstrated by the Nimmo report many years ago, and the concerns of even the Gorton Government in this area, is that under Medicare we have a statistical and data base on which we can investigate. It is this that upsets doctors such as Dr Bruce Shepherd and Dr Michael Aroney in New South Wales. It is this information base that they are attacking and want to get rid of because they know it is the means whereby governments can detect fraud of this type.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fraud and overservicing detection division of the Department of Health, as the Minister for Health, Dr Blewett, and the Public Accounts Committee have said, has not been as effective in the past as it should have been. It will be more effective in the future. Dr Blewett has announced changes made in the fraud and over- servicing detection division of this Department and the Health Insurance Commission. I will obtain details of those changes for Senator MacGibbon and honourable senators generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is concerned about what Senator MacGibbon calls grand larceny. We will continue to attack that grand larceny, as he has put it. We will ensure that the concerns of the Public Accounts Committee and the concerns of the whole Parliament as demonstrated by that Committee will be followed up so that individuals and groups of the type spoken about in the report of that Committee will be brought to justice.

Certainly, this practice is occurring on a new scale but it has always been there to a certain extent, and it always will be a temptation for those in the diagnostic services such as pathology and some of the others who can see a means of making a quick quid. There will always be the temptation there for them to do so.

       <para>
        I must point out, though, as did Senator Peter Baume yesterday, that the vast majority of doctors and, indeed, the vast majority of pathologists, will not take part in such activities. Many of the people who are doing the ripping off in the pathology area-the entrepreneurial doctors-are not themselves pathologists. There is a suggestion that some of them are entrepreneurial general practitioners who set up pathology companies. We have had descriptions of fee splitting, et cetera. So, certainly, on the scale that has been demonstrated by the Public Accounts Committee, it is new, but, unfortunately, it is not a new practice. I believe that what we have now is the capacity that we have not had in the past to do something about it. We have the desire to do something about it in the medical profession, by people on this side of the Parliament and, I believe, by most people on the other side of the Parliament, with a few exceptions like Mr Porter and Mr Carlton who have always defended vigorously the attempts of people like Dr Shepherd and Dr Aroney to destroy the Medicare system, to destroy the very basis on which we can detect such illegal activities.

        The Government's initial reaction to all this is that the South African Government has taken a significant step towards providing common citizenship to all South Africans, and this is to be welcomed. We do note, however, that citizenship will not in the case of blacks carry any political rights whatsoever. That means, of course, that when measured against what really is necessary to confer full civil and political rights upon black South Africans, Senator Jones's description of this measure as being cosmetic may well have some appropriate application. The economic sanctions announced by the Government on 19 August are designed to underscore our position that the South African Government ought to introduce universal adult suffrage. We hope that fundamental reform towards this objective could be made in negotiations with representatives of the black community and lead to peaceful change in that country. We also continue to hope, as Mr Hayden said yesterday, that bipartisan support will be maintained for the very strong position that Australia has adopted over the last decade in relation to South Africa.

For example, there will be an increase in recurrent funding of over $39m. Of course, in excess of 25,000 places will be created over the triennium by our Government's funding policies. So, it is a misinterpretation to look at schools' funding as if it were undermining our efforts in higher education. Any reasonably careful examination of Budget documents would reveal to the authors of that article that this was the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another general criticism that apparently was made in that article is that our policies of improving access to higher education by the disadvantaged have not been realised. Again, if the authors of that article were to look at the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission annual reports they would see that not only have we greatly increased the numbers in post-secondary education overall-in fact, I think there are now 57,000 more students in full time post-secondary education than there were when we came into government-but also the location of those increases is very clearly in those areas which had been neglected previously. For example, there has been a great increase in higher education places in institutions serving the outer western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, areas which were quite grossly neglected during the period of the Fraser Administration. There have been more than proportionate increases in the State of Queensland. As I have said many times in the Senate, Queensland had been very badly neglected, first of all by Queensland governments and then during the period of the Fraser Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one looks at the participation rates of women in higher education, and there has been some media coverage given this week to a statement I released on that subject, one will find that there have been increases in the number of women students enrolled in all areas of higher education. This is a most satisfactory development. In terms of Aboriginal students who have, of course, the lowest participation rates, over 600 Aboriginal students are now involved in higher education courses. I think when we came to office there were little more than 200.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these things have come about not simply, naturally or by coincidence but because the Government has been seeking to achieve these improvements and increases through the negotiations of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission with individual institutions and with higher education co-ordinating authorities in the States. The overall picture, although far from the ideal that we intend to achieve after a few more years in office, is certainly one where our policies of increased participation and equity must be fairly and objectively assessed if they are to be very substantially realised. I hope that the authors of that article pay attention to the corrections that I will certainly make to them. I think it would be encouraging if future publications from academics on this subject paid closer regard to the actual facts of government funding and the effects of government policy.

         —The program to which Senator Hamer refers is already being questioned by people involved in research work in the United States of America. It is being increasingly questioned, particularly because so many United States programs now fall under the umbrella of this program about which there are extreme doubts in sections of the scientific community in that country. Yes, the Government has continually expressed concern about the level of research and development in Australia, although I must say that the research community in Australia has generally produced outstanding results for the size of the population which we have in this country. Comparatively, in world terms, Australia puts in a very good research effort. The problem has not been, however, the quality or extent of that research effort but the relationship between that effort and industry. That is the gap that has to be bridged in the Australian context. The Government is very hopeful that the tax concession-the 150 per cent tax incentive announced recently to operate from 1 July 1985-will be instrumental or helpful in building that bridge.

It is to be hoped that a peaceful way will be found to enable those people actively opposing the Indonesian Government to join the majority of the population of East Timor in working creatively and constructively for the further development of their province.

        As I stated in my reply here to Senator McIntosh on 22 August, the Australian Government supports the activities of the United Nations Secretary-General in seeking a peaceful solution to the residual problems of East Timor. The Government's primary concern remains to ensure that Australia does all that it properly and reasonably can to help the East Timorese. Australia has supported the continued access of the International Committee of the Red Cross to the people of East Timor and has provided aid worth $9m since 1975 in food and humanitarian relief. Further, the Australian Ambassador, Mr Morrison has recently raised again at ministerial level the question of human rights in East Timor and Australia will continue to monitor closely the human rights situation in that province.

         —Senator Sir John Carrick yesterday asked me some questions about the defence budget. I think it is appropriate to put this answer on the record now before we go into Estimates committees. I give this further information on the basis of what was supplied to me by the Minister for Defence. The statements made by Senator Sir John Carrick about figures in the Budget statements being illusory are incorrect. The calculation of the underlying real growth in defence expenditure of 3.1 per cent as quoted in Budget Paper No. 1 at page 83 requires both 1984-85 actual outlays and the 1985-86 Budget provision to be adjusted to a consistent price and exchange basis, as well as for the effect of rescheduled payments under the United States foreign military sales systems.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The basis for the calculation of real growth has been well established over the years. Both the methodology and the actual calculation are agreed between the Departments of Defence and Finance. Moreover, the basis for calculating the 3.1 per cent real growth figure remains exactly the same as that used by the Opposition when it was in government. I further add that it is not simply a matter of applying an estimated full year effect, as done by the honourabe senator. That approach ignores, for example, the fact that a significant part year effect of the devaluation is already reflected in the 1984-85 outlay of $5,941m.
       </para>
       <para>
        I further correct Senator Sir John Carrick's statement that the Department of Defence officer actually advised the Senate Estimates Committee that the then estimated full year effect of changes in the exchange rate was approximately $400m. What he in fact said was that it would be of the order of $350m to $400m. That reference appears at page 214 of the Hansard of 18 April. Finally, I make the point that the Department of Defence can seek adjustments at the Additional Estimates for the effects of price and exchange movements occurring subsequent to the formulation of the Budget.

      <para>
       (a) The Government is committed to introducing a national chemicals notification and assessment scheme. The development of drafting instructions for this legislation is well advanced. The States, industry, the union movement and other interested parties are being consulted in this process. Under the scheme, recommendations will be formulated on all aspects of the production, storage, handling, use and disposal of chemicals; however, application of control measures will continue to be primarily the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Through the chemicals notification and assessment legislation, manufacturers and importers will be required to provide sufficient information on all new chemicals and upon selected existing chemicals to allow adequate assessment of the health and environmental hazards which these chemicals may present. Manufacturers and importers will continue to bear responsibility for the safety of chemicals which they produce and market.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Yes; wherever appropriate OECD chemicals test guidelines, OECD principles of good laboratory practice and other OECD-developed procedures will be incorporated so that the Australian chemicals notification and assessment scheme is harmonised with those operating in other OECD member countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The Government has not considered the concept of an internationally-funded chemical testing laboratory, and is unaware of any such proposal. Consistent with the practice of other OECD countries, the Australian chemicals notification and assessment scheme will assign to manufacturers and importers the responsibility for and costs of generating and providing chemicals testing data. Producers and traders of chemicals have a responsibility to be aware of the potential hazards of commodities in which they deal.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) It is anticipated that much of the chemicals testing required to generate data to meet chemicals notification requirements in Australia (and in other OECD countries) will continue to be performed in the major chemical producing countries. However, the Government will be monitoring the availability of testing facilities in Australia and will take appropriate steps in response to identified needs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) Australian authorities have monitored the discovery of fraudulent practices in the laboratory testing of chemicals in the United States. Steps have been taken to remedy the deficiencies. Data provided under the Australian chemicals notification and assessment scheme will be required to meet the quality standards of the OECD good laboratory practice principles.
      </para>
      <para>
       (g) An Environment contaminants Division has been established within the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment to carry out the function of the proposed Environmental Contaminants Authority. Funding in this area has been significantly increased by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       (h) The regulation of storage of hazardous chemicals and of disposal of hazardous wastes are principally the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. Commonwealth and State environment authorities are developing a national strategy on hazardous wastes. The Australian Environment Council is initiating a national consultative process on management and disposal of hazardous wastes to facilitate the introduction of appropriate measures for hazardous waste management.
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Regulation of the availability, labelling and approved uses of all pesticides, including organochlorine, organophosphorus and carbamate types, is effected through State legislation. Clearance of pesticides is co-ordinated nationally through the Australian Agricultural Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       (j) The Government does not plan to introduce an incentive arrangement relating to degradability of pesticides. Degradability is taken into account in the clearance of pesticides. Most modern-day pesticides have a short residual life in the environment. Some pesticides because of their end-use need to be stable in the environment.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. In fact the prospects of the dispute at Mudginberri widening was one of the reasons why my Department decided not to appoint other than Departmental meat inspectors to perform export inspection duties at Mudginberri. Those meat inspectors who are members of the Meat Inspector's Association (MIA) refused, on the instructions of their Association, to cross the ACTU endorsed picket line established by the AMIEU near the abattoir. The Department's decision led to the abattoir management, supported by the NFF and MATFA, seeking in the Federal Court under the Administrative Decision (Judicial Review) Act a review of my Department's decision. That action was unsuccessful.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Meat Inspectors employed in my Department were instructed to cross the picket line but refused on the instructions of the MIA. My Department considered that even with the provision of police protection the risk of physical injury to its staff either at Mudginberri or at other abattoirs where those staff may subsequently be employed was real and that use of such protection had the potential to widen the dispute.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In an endeavour to assist the resolution of the dispute between the Meat and Allied Trades Federation (MATFA) and the National Farmers Federation (NFF) on the one hand and the AMIEU on the other I met separately with representatives of AMIEU and NFF. At the former meeting a representative of the MIA was also present. In addition to those meetings my Department also had meetings with NFF and MIA, and was involved in two Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hearings on this matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and I also endeavoured to bring all the parties together for discussion but this was unsuccessful as the employers declined to attend.
      </para>
      <para>
       It must be realised that these endeavours have been made in an atmosphere of deteriorating relationships between the parties to the dispute and while the employers were taking action through the Federal Court, under Section 45 of the Trade Practices Act against the AMIEU and MIA as well as the action mentioned in (1) above. The Government's efforts have, however, resulted in the AMIEU lodging an application with the Commission on 27 August, 1985. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has stated that before the Commission considers the matter the picket line will need to be lifted.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The advantage of time sharing schemes is that they can provide holiday makers with access to resort ownership which they may not otherwise be able to afford. It is also possible to exchange entitlements for equivalent time at other resorts within and outside Australia. Disadvantages include a relatively high initial capital outlay, the possibility of difficulties with resale and the likelihood of increasing maintenance costs as the building ages.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has stated that there are no specific taxation disadvantages associated with `time-sharing' holiday schemes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where a person enters into a `time-sharing' arrangement for the purpose of securing for himself or herself holiday accommodation, any expenditure so incurred does not qualify for income tax deduction. That is no different, however, from any other situation where a person incurs expenditure on holidays. The income tax law regards expenditure on holidays as expenditure of a domestic or private nature which is specifically precluded from income tax deduction.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) My Department is not aware of the details of the financial difficulties caused by timeshare in the USA, however, in Australia, the Gold Coast City Council has received a number of complaints about aggressive marketing practices. Consequently it has taken action, under its authority to grant itinerant vendor's licences, to remove offending persons from public areas of the Gold Coast.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Timesharing is a general expression which refers to a variety of arrangements whereby the incidents of occupation of property are divided among a number of persons by reference to certain periods of time during which each of those persons obtains the right to occupy or use that property, or an identifiable part of that property, on a recurring basis.

      <para>
       (1) While it is true that any devaluation is statistically equivalent to an increase in the average tariff rate for import competing industries, the actual ``effect'' of any particular percentage devaluation on a given level of protection over a 12 month period is extremely difficult to estimate and will depend on a number of factors, many of which act to offset the effect of increased protection. For example:
      </para>
      <para>
       the protection afforded Australian industries would be reduced as the cost of imported inputs would also increase following the devaluation;
      </para>
      <para>
       overseas suppliers may adjust their prices downwards in terms of foreign currency following a devaluation as a means of maintaining market share in which case the effect on protection would be less than would otherwise be the case;
      </para>
      <para>
       there is a time dimension which is difficult to incorporate into the assessment, since a floating exchange rate will result in daily variations in the value of the $A and hence the effect on import-competing industries will continue to change; in this context, the extent to which labour costs are discounted for price increases following a devaluation will also influence the overall effect on protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The likely effect on the average effective rate of protection for manufacturing with an Australian dollar rate of $US0.70 will depend on the factors noted in (1) above as well as the period over which the change is calculated and the dollar value at the start of the period chosen.

It was under these arrangements that New South Wales proposed, and the Commonwealth endorsed, the New South Wales rainforests for nomination to the World Heritage List.

       (a) The Commonwealth Censorship Board has not reduced the time of 10 hours per week which is currently available to each commercial television network for the screening and classification of imported television programs although the matter had been under preliminary consideration earlier in the year. At the request of the Government, the Film Censorship Board reconsidered the matter to allow discussion of alternative methods of performing this role.
      </para>
      <para>
       The background to the proposal was an examination of the most appropriate deployment of the resources of the Film Censorship Board, given the increased demand placed on the Board by the compulsory classification of video tapes. In addition, the Board has been performing a non-statutory role of examining certain television programs for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal since 1957. Against this background, the role of the Board has been and continues to be the subject of review.
      </para>

       (b) If an alternative method were adopted, this would not entail any cutback in the quality of programs resulting from the review.

       </para>

      <para>
       (1)-(4) The area commonly known as Westbourne Woods contains two distinct sections: the Arboretum, a collection of native and exotic trees and the Pine Plantation, a large block of radiata pines. These areas are entered on the Interim List of the National Estate as `Westbourne Woods'. An adjoining area of the Yarralumla Nursery and public parkland has been referred to as Westbourne Woods in the past.
      </para>
      <para>
       The bulk of the area listed as Westbourne Woods is held under lease by the Royal Canberra Golf Club. An area on the eastern side of Westbourne Woods contains the buildings of the CSIRO Division of Forest Research and a small medium density housing development under residential lease.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Territories places high value on the need to maintain and protect trees and on the historic and scientific worth of all plantings in Westbourne Woods. The lease conditions of the Golf Club and development conditions of housing developers require that no tree is to be removed or damaged without prior consent of the Commonwealth. Proposals for the removal of trees likely to have a significant impact on the area also must be referred to the Australian Heritage Commission for comment. These conditions are strictly enforced.
      </para>
      <para>
       An inventory has been taken of all trees in the Arboretum and the health and conservation status of each species has been evaluated as a guide to management and protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thinning and tree surgery is carried out regularly to improve the health and safety of the older trees. Replacement and planting of additional species has been undertaken in recent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Golf Club has been required to produce an approved development plan for any further course alteration. This will enable the Department to minimise conflict between the needs of the Club and future management of the Woods.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Arboretum has proved to be an invaluable aid in predicting the performance of a wide range of plant species which might be used in the region. In addition, it is recognised as a valuable resource for the scientific study of trees and is widely used by organisations such as CSIRO and the Australian National University.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are two areas within Westbourne Woods where approval has been given for the future removal of trees. These are: The Arboretum, to enable the final stage of housing development to be undertaken; and the Pine Plantation, for the construction of a further nine fairways for the Golf Club.
      </para>
      <para>
       Developers must submit to the National Capital Development Commission detailed plans showing the numbers and location of trees intended for removal as part of any proposed development in Westbourne Woods. These plans are made available to my Department and the Australian Heritage Commission for comment.
      </para>
      <para>
       In general it is not the practice of the National Capital Development Commission or the Department to make public, details of development proposals by lessees of Commonwealth land without prior approval by the lessee. However, because of the particular interests of the Canberra and South-East Region Environment Centre and the Westbourne Woods Action Association in this matter the Department has agreed to discuss the development proposals and draft Management Plan for Westbourne Woods with these groups.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. The Commonwealth, during 1984-85 made payments to the Victorian Government for health services of $344.2m via the identified health grant arrangements and a further $249.2m under the Medicare compensation payments. This represents a per capita allocation of $146.40. This compares with New South Wales which received $521.4m (identified health grant) and $368.5m for Medicare which provides a per capita allocation of $165.46, i.e. Victoria received $19.06 less per capita than New South Wales.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reason that funding levels vary from State to State relates to individual State costs and charging practices. The identified health grants have, as their genesis, the Medibank hospital cost sharing arrangements, community health grants and the school dental program which ceased in 1981-82. The base levels of identified health grants were the payments made in 1980-81 for those programs, adjusted in the case of hospital cost sharing for additional revenue raising capacity of States. The grants have been increased each year since 1981-82 to reflect increases in costs. Different States have different cost structures and mixes of services and charging policies within their hospital systems which have led to differences in the allocation of Commonwealth funds when compared on a per capita basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under Medicare States are reimbursed on the basis of revenue lost and increased costs associated with the introduction of Medicare. The introduction of Medicare has also affected States in different ways leading to differing levels of per capita allocation to States under the arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The level of identified health grants for 1985-86 was discussed at the 1985 Premiers' Conference in the context of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's `Report on Tax Sharing Relativities 1985'. At the Conference it was agreed that the identified health grant arrangements would continue as separate payments from general revenue financial assistance grants for the 1985-86-1987-88 triennium. The levels of grants would be the 1984-85 payments adjusted by an appropriate index to hold them at the same real levels as in 1984-85. At the Premiers' Conference it was also agreed that the Medicare compensation arrangements would continue until 1987-88. It should be noted that the identified health grant payments and the Medicare grants are untied funding and, with the general tax revenue grants to States, are available to States to spend in accordance with their own priorities.

      <para>
       The Government will maintain its commitment to introduce legislation into the Parliament which will amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 following reviews of the Act by His Honour Mr Justice Toohey and by Dr Jon Altman. Such amendments will be consistent with the Government's overall position on national land rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has stated that there will be continued consultation with relevant parties to refine and develop acceptable amendments. The extent of these consultations may preclude such amendments. Being considered by Parliament during these sittings.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The proposed amendments to the Act will overcome anomalies which presently allow claims to Aboriginal owned pastoral properties, stock routes, stock reserves and public purpose lands;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Such legislation will be consistent with the principles encompassed in the national approach on land rights, which currently provides for a ten year deadline on applications for land grants;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The Government is committed to the provision of secure title to Aborigines on community living areas excised from pastoral leases. By conferring an appropriate form of secure title the Government may provide essential services, including capital works, to these Aboriginal communities. The Government is encouraged by the initiative of the Northern Territory Government in taking its own action to provide these community living areas. It is my intention to review the progress made for excisions by the Northern Territory Government in October of this year, when the Territory procedural arrangements will have been in operation for six months.
