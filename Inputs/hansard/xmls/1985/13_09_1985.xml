       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Hawke Government's failure to correct the anomalies arising from the application of the assets test on pensioners, with the failure of the Australian Democrats to support Senator Messner's bill to repeal the assets test, is causing unnecessary hardship for Australia's aged, particularly those living in rural areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Hawke Government will itself take action to repeal its iniquitous and anomalous test.

       Nursing Home Benefits
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Without any warning and at the worst possible moment, the Federal Government has abandoned the pensioner patients in South Australia's Nursing Homes. These people are suffering undeserving hardship and trauma as a result of the Federal Government's decision to freeze the nursing home benefit levels in South Australia:
      </para>
      <para>
       The pensioner patients and those on fixed incomes now cannot expect any relief from recent significant fee increases approved by the Department of Community Services and which have coincided with the decision to freeze benefits.
      </para>
      <para>
       80-85 per cent of nursing home patients are pensioners and the majority are now required to pay in excess of their pension for their nursing care for the very first time. Some are paying over $5 per day on top of their pension. Many are looking for cheaper nursing care that doesn't exist.
      </para>
      <para>
       We request that the Federal Government:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. alleviate the distress of South Australia's nursing home patients and their families by effective restoration of the principle that pensioner patients should not have to pay more than their pension for nursing home care
      </para>
      <para>
       2. restore the review of the benefit rates in November 1985
      </para>
      <para>
       3. resolve its concern over health care costs with the South Australian Government rather than inflicting unnecessary suffering on nursing home patients.

       Health Fund Contributions or Benefits: Taxation

       That we the undersigned are totally opposed to any taxation change which involves a tax on Health Fund contributions or benefits.

       1. The Watsonia Army Barracks contains electronic communication facilities, operated by Australian and American personnel, that gives the United States the ability to pin-point Soviet nuclear submarines, hidden in the Oceans.

       2. This would make it possible for U.S. killer-submarines to destroy all Soviet nuclear submarines, while the U.S. nuclear submarines launch their missiles in a ``first strike'' attack.

       Taxation

      <para>
       To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``The richest 2,000 people own as much as the poorest 2 1/2 million. It is a travesty in these circumstances that 2 million people are living in poverty in this country.'' (Bob Hawke Sydney Morning Herald 11/7/81)
      </para>
      <para>
       The present provision of Social Security Benefits are absolutely inadequate, locking recipients into poverty (including 8,000 children of those on Social Welfare).
      </para>
      <para>
       To enable all Australian citizens to share in the wealth of their country we call on the Australian Government in the forthcoming tax reform to:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Raise the tax threshold to $10,000
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Double the permissible income of $30 to $60 per week with the cut out point for fringe benefits $90.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. All pensions and benefits to be raised to 30% of the male average weekly earnings and indexed to the CPI.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. All pensions to be paid on an individual basis to eliminate the discrimination against married couples currently losing $30 per week.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, we strongly oppose the introduction of a broad based indirect tax thereby shifting the tax burden on to those dependent on Social Welfare and low income earners, further increasing their poverty, while allowing the continuation of high income earners and tax avoiders to pay little or no tax.

       (b) As a consequence of decisions taken at Yalta, several nations of Central and Eastern Europe were abandoned by the West to Soviet domination;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The divisions of Soviet tanks kept in Eastern Europe since World War II have not been there to fulfill defence commitments under the Warsaw Pact, as British and American forces are present in West Germany under NATO obligations. For the only occasions on which Soviet forces have ever been in action in Europe since the last war have been when they crushed spontaneous uprisings of populations under their occupation, such as in East Berlin (1953), in Poland and Hungary (1956), and in Czechoslovakia (1968).

Meanwhile, the Government expects that there will be no release of water from within the mine's restricted release zone.

I ask the Minister: Why has the Government allowed Australia to slip to being 23rd out of the 24 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in terms of the proportion of the health dollar-one per cent-allocated to medical research? Why has the Government shown absolutely no concern about the fact that, as a result of this situation, young scientists are not going into medical research, experienced researchers are being forced overseas or into other fields, in 1985, out of 452 research projects highly recommended for funding, only 285 could be funded with available moneys, and projects which are essential for preventing serious and expensive health care problems in Australia have had to be shelved? Does the Government agree that if the current funding situation continues it will inevitably result in an irretrievable decline in our medical research capacity, technological skill, innovative capacity and ability to respond to urgent unexpected public health problems such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome? Does the Government also agree that in the long term this would be disastrous for the health of Australians?

In reply to the series of questions he has asked, I make it clear that the Government firmly believes that strong medical research is vital. That is why our Government has increased funding to the National Health and Medical Research Council by 72 per cent since it took office. I am unaware of information suggesting that young scientists are not going into medical research or that experienced researchers are going overseas. Obviously, not every application can be funded, particularly as the number of applications has increased from 746 in 1980 to 920 in 1985. As a result of this Goverment's increased funding of medical research, however, the number of grants supported by the NHMRC over the last five years has increased from 509 in 1980 to 734 in 1985. It is clear that our Government has considerably increased funding for medical research. Senator Missen will be aware that in the 1985 Budget the NHMRC received $50.781m for medical research, an increase of 14.9 per cent over the previous financial year. In addition, the Government has provided $750,000 specifically for research into AIDS.

I expect that when the Prime Minister or the Treasurer is in a position to announce the new taxation reform package that announcement will contain some constructive measures in relation to poverty traps. It is certainly the view of our Government that it is necessary to take steps to deal with the fact that the interaction of tax and social security measures creates a poverty trap for low income people. We are determined to help ease the poverty trap situation to assist people to move from welfare to work.

        I remind Senator Elstob that in this year's Budget the Government raised the allowable income for the unemployed by 50 per cent; that is, from $20 to $30. This placed the unemployed on a more equal footing with pensioners. The Government is finalising its review of taxation arising out of the draft White Paper and the tax summit. Poverty traps have received close attention. The Government will be taking steps to address further the problem of poverty traps in the Treasurer's statement later this month.

In direct purchasing, Australian interests are protected through a process of competition with the lowest priced technically acceptable offer being selected. If no competition is possible we run a number of checks which might include some or all of the following: Previous price paid, price paid by other customers and audit of costs. Concerning purchasing through the United States Government, its procurement agencies perform the same function that we perform for a direct purchase. If overcharging were to arise under the United States Government arrangements, and it was proved, the price quoted to Australia would be amended.

        The Government has had the benefit of a number of reports in relation to the matter, in particular, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development examiners and the Kirby Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs from which the Government's traineeship proposals for young people stemmed. There was, of course, some sort of academic debate about it in which the Flinders University Institute of Labour Studies has been a prominent participant. I think it is correct to say that all those studies have not in any sense identified themselves with the view expressed by Mr Howard; that is to say, it is too expensive to employ young people. They have adverted to a wide range of other complex issues which undoubtedly contribute to youth unemployment.

I remind Senator Aulich that on 13 August the Government announced a $60m three-year agreement under which a pre-determined revenue supplement will be paid to underwrite the losses of AN in Tasmania. That will be made up by $18.4m in the current financial year, $17.8m in 1986-87 and $16.2m in 1987-88.

We fail to understand why the Tasmanian Premier has not been happy with the arrangements, which represent an improvement over the last decade in the way in which the line is subsidised.

        The solution is certainly not to reduce their income and thus force them into worse poverty. The solution is to find ways for them to move out of poverty into a secure and decent standard of living. The suggestion in an earlier question from Senator Elstob concerning poverty traps is the constructive way to approach this matter. It is the case that the poorest people in Australia are single parent families and, of course, 90 per cent of single parent families are headed by women. The solution is not to reduce their benefits further or to fail to increase their benefits to keep up with inflation and other increases in the cost of living; rather, it is to pursue constructive policies which will enable them to move, on a part time basis or perhaps ultimately a full time basis, out of the welfare sector into secure employment. That objective requires a lot of effort by government. It involves training opportunities, which have been expanding under our Government. It requires increased educational opportunities for women or people in those circumstances; these opportunities have also been increased under our Government. It requires changes to the taxation system to attack the poverty traps which I spoke about in answer to Senator Elstob's question earlier. Certainly, our Government is intent on doing all of those things and in this way constructively assisting the poorest people in our community and their families.

Is she familiar with the decisions which have apparently been taken by her Government to amend the Family Law Act to require the Family Court of Australia to ignore social security benefits in determining maintenance? Is that report correct? Has the Minister for Social Security signalled that move in a speech to the Australian Council of Social Service? I further ask the Minister: Is it the policy of her Government to strengthen the maintenance collection arrangements, a policy which was advocated by it in 1983? Can she explain to the Senate in what way what is being put forward by the Government in this field is different from what I have been arguing, namely, that a strengthening of maintenance collection and changes to the Family Law Act would in fact improve disposable income and shift some of the burden from taxpayers to the private citizens who probably should bear those burdens?

I welcome the equivocation, but what I would really like to see is a rush of honesty to the head by Mr Howard and a prompt repudiation of the irresponsible promises by the former Leader of the Opposition, and Senator Messner, among others, to abolish the assets test. That policy is absolutely incompatible with the other line the Opposition tries to run simultaneously; that is, that welfare spending should be needs based.

       <para>
        By way of a trade-off on the effect on government outlays, the savings from the assets test in this year have provided sufficient money to fund the Government's welfare package in this year's Budget. That welfare package included an increase of $2 a week in the additional benefit for dependent children of pensioners and beneficiaries; a $2 a week increase in family income supplement-that is for the very low income unemployed families; a $10 a week increase in the income test free area for unemployment and sickness beneficiaries; and a $3 a week increase in the single adult unemployment benefit rate. Instead of doing those things, it is quite apparent that, up to date, the Opposition would abolish the assets test and not target any additional assistance at all to those very needy groups I have identified. I trust that Mr Valder and the other faceless men of the Liberal Party will ultimately be as successful at changing Liberal Party policy as they have been at changing Liberal Party leadership.

One of the causes of the problems that individual cane growers now have is the fact that they paid far too much for assigned land in 1980 and 1981. One of the reasons they paid far too much for assigned land was the expectation of tax free capital gain on that land. In other words, the absence of a capital gains tax is a contributory factor to the insolvency not only of the cane growers but also of a number of other Australian primary producers.

         —Certainly. The Commonwealth Government has made an offer to Queensland for an underwriting scheme which would guarantee specific prices to Queensland growers, conditional upon two things: Firstly, that there be a restructuring and a deregulation of the industry. I would expect the Liberal Party to be entirely supportive of a deregulation of the sugar industry since it purports to be in favour of deregulation in general, although to date it almost invariably votes against deregulation; for example, the Kerin dairy industry plan. The offer is conditional also on the Queensland Government matching the Commonwealth's contribution to the underwriting price.

        Given that it is virtually only a Queensland industry, it is particularly important that the State Government makes a contribution. The Queensland Government has a couple of hundred million dollars stuffed away in hollow logs of various sorts. A good deal of that money comes from Commonwealth Government loans to the State Government for rural adjustment, which have been repaid by farmers but not repaid to the Commonwealth Government. The money has been stuffed instead into some hollow logs, or the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation, or whatever it is. We are not quite sure where it is, but we know that a couple of hundred million dollars is stuffed in hollow logs somewhere in Queensland. So the State Government cannot legitimately claim that it does not have the funds to match the Commonwealth contribution.

        As I understand, the current position is that the Commonwealth Government's very generous offer has been rejected by Queensland.

         —The short answer to Senator Tate's last question is, yes, of course the Commonwealth Government will withstand that. For as long as I have had knowledge of the Commonwealth Bank it has paid very respect- able dividends to the taxpayers who are its owners. Of course, as Senator Tate said, the Liberal Party proposes to flog it off to some foreigner thereby denying taxpayers those healthy dividends.

        On the broader question of privatisation-Senator Tate mentioned Australia Post and Telecom-it has penetrated into the consciousness of some of the brighter members of the Liberal Party that it is not possible to recover fully the cost of providing postal and telephone services to the sparsely populated areas of Australia or, probably, anywhere outside the capital cities. Therefore, if privatisation, so called, is to be fully implemented there will be no telephones and no mail deliveries anywhere outside the capital cities. Of course, some members of the Liberal Party are smart enough to know that.

         —Senator Messner is not one of the smarter members of the Liberal Party. The smarter members of the Liberal Party say that the problem can be addressed by a direct payment from the Budget to whoever privatises these organisations and that will maintain services in those areas. That would cost something like $500m for Telecom alone. More importantly, it would, of course, destroy the rationale for the privatisation policy. If a private firm knew that the Commonwealth Government was underwriting its losses quite obviously there would be no incentive to minimise costs. Indeed, there would be an incentive to maximise costs.

        Finally, I do not have any rigid ideological views about privatisation. I think that is fairly well known. Certainly, it has been said publicly before. However, organisations such as Australia Post and Telecom, by their very nature, cannot be privatised without withdrawing services from a very large section of the Australian population. Also the Commonwealth Bank pays very healthy dividends. There is one Commonwealth Government business undertaking which I, as Minister for Finance, would be delighted to privatise. I refer to the Tasmanian railways which cost taxpayers almost $20m in operating losses last year. I look forward to Senator Walters standing up in Hobart, Launceston, Burnie, Smithton and all those other places and promising-in accordance with her new Leader's policy-to privatise the Tasmanian railways. I will be delighted if she can get a bidder to take over the Tasmanian railways thereby relieving Commonwealth taxpayers of the burden of underwriting the losses of that railway system which last year amounted to almost $20m.

        On the question of maintenance collection and enforcement, when I was Attorney-General I initiated a major inquiry which looked comprehensively at the best systems of maintenance enforcement, both in Australia and overseas. That inquiry produced a substantial report which was released last year for public comment. It recommended a new national enforcement agency with major improvements in enforcement methods. It also recommended that the systems which presently exist in South Australia and Western Australia, and which have achieved substantial success in those jurisdictions, be absorbed into rather than superseded by the operations of any such national body. As Senator Ryan has said, the Government is presently considering, through an interdepartmental committee, a range of options to improve enforcement of support obligations, including the possibility of a new agency of this kind. The Government will form a view and reach a decision on that in due course.

         —In response to that part of the question about Neil Brown, the answer is yes, it is just another case of Opposition knocking. I have seen the employment figures for August, which are welcomed by the Government because they show that there has been an increase in total employment in that one month of another 20,000, bringing to 430,000 the number of jobs created since April 1983 and the National Economic Summit. On a pro rata basis this is well ahead of the target of 500,000 jobs within three years which the Government had set for itself on assuming office. That target was greeted with almost universal cynicism and disbelief and, of course, outright ridicule by members of the Opposition, such as Mr Brown.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Since this Government has been in office it has created jobs at four times the rate of its predecessor, taken over its full term. As I have said, 430,000 additional jobs have appeared in the 28 months since April 1983, which exceeds in absolute numbers the 340,000 additional jobs which appeared in the seven years and four months that the discredited former Government was in office. I think it should be noted for the record that for five of those years the present Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer and, therefore, had primary responsibility for economic performance. In the last year of the previous Government almost 200,000 jobs were lost. Not only did employment cease to grow but also it actually fell in absolute terms by almost 200,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, although there are month by month fluctuations in the employment level due to statistical imperfections which, in my view, nobody seems able to explain, the trend is very clear. The trend is that employment is growing at a rate probably without precedent. It is growing at a rate four times as fast as that which existed when our predecessors were in office. The Government is well ahead on a pro rata basis of the target of achieving 500,000 new jobs in its first three years in office.

        This draws attention to yet another fundamental contradiction in the muddled economic policies which the Opposition has produced in recent months. There is the fundamental contradiction between a policy position in general that welfare payments should be based on need and the simultaneous promise to repeal the assets test; the contradiction between the so-called privatisation argument and the failure to address matters such as Tasmanian railways. I mentioned that earlier because although I do not believe that the Commonwealth Bank, which pays very healthy dividends to the taxpayers, should be flogged off to foreigners-which Mr Howard wants to do-I would welcome any bid for the Tasmanian railways to relieve Commonwealth taxpayers of the responsibility of funding the losses there. But I have yet to hear from Mr Howard, or even Senator Walters, any commitment to a Liberal government withdrawing from the Tasmanian railway system. I would certainly welcome such a commitment from Mr Howard or even Senator Walters that a Liberal government would privatise it.

         —Ministers of all departments were required to make savings of approximately 5 per cent in relation to the current Budget. According to the 14 May statement those projected savings would start on 1 July. Although my Department is not precisely on target, I understand we are about $1m out of a projected saving of $60m-as close as that. I remind Senator Ray that despite the savings that were effected by the 14 May statement, the Government increased expenditure to my Department in the current financial year by $260m-odd and has committed itself to a program of spending $100m on upgrading the repatriation hospitals over the next three years. Whilst it is true there have been some savings within the Department, there has also been additional expenditure. So there has been a redirection of financial resources within the Department. I am please to say that, generally speaking, according to what I have been advised this week, we are substantially on target.

         —My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Has the Minister noted the release of the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicating that manufacturing costs rose by 12.8 per cent in the year ended 30 June 1985, more than double the consumer price index rate? Has he further noted the ominous increase of 19.3 per cent in the cost of imported materials which represents a significant proportion of input costs for manufacturing, no doubt due now and in the future to the continuing collapse of the Australian dollar since February? Is the Government concerned at the resumption of the fall of the Australian dollar which presages a continuance of inflationary pressures on manufacturing costs and consequently leads to loss of jobs? In light of the Government's cave-in to the Australian Council of Trade Unions on wage discounting last week, what measures does the Government have in mind to minimise the compounding effect of these disastrous foreshadowed cost increases for manufacturing?

         —I had not noted the specific ABS figure to which Senator Messner referred. I am willing-possibly recklessly-to accept that what he said is, in fact, correct and that the ABS has reported those sorts of figures, stating principally that manufacturing costs rose by 12 per cent in the year ended June 1985. Of course, a major contributor to any such rise would have been the increase in inputs to manufacturing which are imported and, therefore, directly associated with the devaluation of the dollar. I understand that the same survey stated that the manufacturing cost increases are presently slowing. As to the 12 per cent, I draw Senator Messner's attention to the fact that in the last two years of the Fraser Government wages costs were increasing by 13 and 14 per cent because we had a wages explosion triggered off by the Fraser Government's first disastrous experiment with deregulating the labour market in May 1981. One would have thought that the Bourbons of the Liberal Party, as has been observed before-even given that they are Bourbons-would have learnt something from the 1981 and 1982 wages explosion which was triggered off by their first flirtation with a deregulated labour market.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What Senator Messner calls the cave-in to the ACTU is, in fact, an agreement between the Government and the ACTU which cements for another two years the wages accord which has reduced the growth of money wages by 50 per cent from the rates which prevailed in the halcyon days of regulation of the former Governments. I note also that Senator Messner and the other economic quislings in the Opposition persist in attempting to sabotage the Australian economy by saying that the value of the dollar will continue to fall. That is one of the fashions set by the former Liberal Party Government during the 1983 election campaign which, one would have hoped, the Liberal Party would now have abandoned under its new leadership. The Liberal Party should cease its persistent attempts to undermine our growth rate and to sabotage the Australian economy by continually foreasting that interest rates will go up and the value of the dollar will go down.

Are we to understand from the Minister's reply that, in fact, this means of controlling the rising costs to manufacturing because of the falling value of the dollar will be again to approach the trade union movement to seek to have wages further discounted for the effect of devaluation, perhaps during the latter part of next year?

         —I do find this sort of question from people like Senator Messner and the other economic quislings rather tiresome. The fact is that real unit labour costs are lower now than they have been at any time since 1970-71. I point out to Senator Messner that this is contained in the Budget Papers, if he would like to look it up. I cannot give him the exact page, but if he telephones my office, it probably can. Real unit labour costs are lower than they have been at any time since the discredited former Fraser Government was in office and Mr Howard was Treasurer. The figure varies compared with the figure in any particular year during the five years when Mr Howard was Treasurer. But it varies between, from memory, something like 5 per cent and 7 per cent. Real labour unit costs are between 5 per cent and 7 per cent lower under the policies of this Government, thanks to the wages accord, than they were at any time when Mr Howard was Treasurer.

Independent scientific tests have shown that the asbestos fibres which triggered high readings and caused recent evacuations from the National Library building were not of the type of asbestos being removed. Guards have been placed on the 12 monitors to prevent physical tampering during working hours. Part time contract staff are employed to guard the monitors until readings are taken each day. We acknowledge that evacuations seriously inconvenience readers and staff and are costly to the taxpayer. The Library management maintains contact with the contractors removing the asbestos and the engineers, architects and unions involved, in an effort to eliminate any risk to health, inconvenience to readers and an unnecessary waste of staff time.

The answer supplied to me by the Minister for Defence is as follows: Our records indicate that since January 1981, 32 United States surveillance aircraft have used facilities on the Cocos Islands. As with visits by foreign military aircraft to any part of Australia, each visit must be requested and approved in accordance with standard arrangements for diplomatic clearance of visiting military aircraft. The mission of the United States aircraft making these visits was long-range maritime surveillance. The aircraft involved were United States Navy P3 Orion long-range maritime patrol aircraft, similar to those used by the Royal Australian Air Force for the same type of mission.

        As a matter of policy the United States does not confirm or deny whether its aircraft carry nuclear weapons. The Australian Government would not consider, however, that its firm policy that nuclear weapons should not be stored on or involved in the staging of operations from Australian territory is likely to be offended by the activities of these aircraft. There are no United States facilities on the Cocos Islands. United States aircraft staging through the Cocos Islands make use of the civil airfield and associated facilities, as do RAAF aircraft.

I am advised by the Minister for Aviation that air traffic controllers in this country follow procedures recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. In circumstances where an aircraft has diverted from its agreed course or altitude, or otherwise shown signs of abnormal performance, a controller's first action would be to try to contact the pilot to determine the nature and extent of the problem, so that a judgment could be made as to the need to invoke emergency measures. Once the pilot has communicated his difficulties and/or his requirements, the controller would be conscious of the need to keep further contact to a minimum in order to avoid distracting the pilot. I think that answers the question raised by Senator Townley.

         —On Tuesday, 20 August 1985, I presented to the Senate the conditions, determined by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, for granting access to proceedings of the two Houses of the Parliament for the purpose of recording and broadcasting excerpts. During debate on the statement Senator Peter Rae referred to condition No. 8, which states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        `Qualified privilege only shall apply to broadcasters in the use of excerpts.'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Rae requested elaboration of this condition and noted:
       </para>
       <para>
        There are differences in relation to State defamation law and the meaning of `qualified privilege' does differ.
       </para>
       <para>
        Condition No. 8 is not really a condition properly so called, but expresses the Committee's opinion as to the state of the law. The Committee cannot declare or change the law in relation to the privilege attaching to the broadcasting or televising of excerpts; nor can either House by itself declare or change the law. The condition was included by the Committee to indicate to broadcasters making use of excerpts the state of the law. It is clear that absolute privilege attaches to senators making speeches in the Senate, by virtue of section 49 of the Constitution. Absolute privilege also attaches, under the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946, to the broadcasting or rebroadcasting of any portion of the proceedings which the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is required to make under that Act. The publication of Hansard by the Government Printer also attracts absolute privilege.
       </para>
       <para>
        The publication of extracts from debates, however, attracts only qualified privilege, and in this regard, in the view of the Committee, broadcasters using excerpts will be in exactly the same position as newspapers. The Committee considers that this is appropriate, and that the protection of qualified privilege is sufficient for the broadcasting of excerpts. It is to be noted that the corresponding committee of the British Parliament came to the same conclusion. The Committee considered that absolute privilege is appropriate only where a broadcaster is required to broadcast proceedings, as is the case with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The conditions which I presented on 20 August were determined by the Committee after discussions with representatives of the media following the presentation of proposed conditions on 27 May 1985. It is true, as Senator Rae states, that the law relating to qualified privilege differs from State to State, in the absence of uniform defamation laws. The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended that legislation be enacted to provide, amongst other things, uniform qualified privilege for the reporting of parliamentary proceedings throughout Australia. The Broadcasting Committee was aware of this problem of the lack of uniformity in the law, and took this matter into consideration when determining the conditions.
