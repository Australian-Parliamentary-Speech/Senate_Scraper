       <para>
        To the Honourable the President and Senators in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that:
       </para>
       <para>
        The students and staff of the University of Queensland express their dismay at the lack of adequate federal government funding to our University, which has resulted, inter alia, in the erosion of our Library facilities-we note that:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. The opening hours of our main Library have been reduced from 93 1/2 hours a week in 1975 to 72 hours a week in 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. The number of new books purchased per year has fallen from over 50,000 in 1976 to under 23,000 in 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. The number of books in storage and inaccessible to students and staff has risen from none in 1977 to over 40,000 in 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. The number of books discarded in 1976 was over 6,000-by the end of 1981 over 70,000 had been discarded.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe this to be educationally retrograde and economically wasteful. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate urge the Government to increase funding to a level sufficient to allow the University to restore our previous Library facilities.

        That your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. As this area is on the Register of the National Estate it is therefore of national concern and your petitioners humbly call upon the Senate to conduct a Senate Inquiry into South West Tasmania. A Federal Inquiry has been recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.

        Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.

      </para>
      <para>
       The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14% of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.

       The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.

       This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.

       Plant Variety Rights

      </para>
      <para>
       1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,

       (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.

       1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:
      </para>

       (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.

       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth concern over Plant Variety Rights (PVR) legislation. We agree that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. PVR will inhibit the free exchange of genetic material for plant breeding.
      </para>
      <para>

       3. PVR will restrict the public plant breeding program to basic research for exploitation by private enterprise and discourage breeding for disease and pest resistant varieties.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. PVR will lead to the domination of the seed industry by foreign interests not responsible to the Australian people.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. The proprietary rights granted by PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.

Are there any comparable restrictions on individuals becoming officials of trade unions? Does the Commonwealth have power to legislate to impose restrictions if it so desires? Is it a fact that the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union found that in 1981, of the 11 officials of that union, each had a criminal record, with numbers of convictions ranging from three to 61; only two had not served prison sentences; and only two had not used false aliases?

In fact, the position is as outlined by the honourable senator in his question-that is, the report does detail a lamentable involvement of people with criminal records in that union. That is a matter to which I might ask the Opposition to direct some of its attention. There are no restrictions on participation in union affairs equivalent to the restrictions which are placed on people with criminal records participating in commercial activities. The Companies Act which was enacted by this Parliament and to which many members of the Senate contributed contains restrictions which inhibit participation in company management by people with criminal records. If someone has been convicted of an offence that carries a penalty of, I think, three months' imprisonment or more, there is an extensive period of debarment from participation in the directorship of a company. The time of disqualification is for five years after the conviction or five years after the release from prison.

       <para>
        I can understand Senator Hamer suggesting, in light of the findings of the Costigan report with respect to the painters and dockers, that similar restrictions on participation in trade union activities might be appropriate. It is certainly true that power and influence are wielded in this community not only through commercial organisations such as companies but also through the trade union movement. I will certainly ensure that the suggestion contained in Senator Hamer's question is carefully examined by the Minister and by the Government because I think there would be very considerable disquiet in this community at the ready way in which people with serious criminal charges to their names are able to take part in union activities in a way which is clearly not in the national or community interest.

The statement Mr Howard made did reveal that there had been delays in the DCS Office in Perth. I pointed that out to the permanent head of my Department and asked him to tell me why counsel had not been re-engaged in relation to the matter. But, of course, that did not reveal at that stage the actual nature of the problems that were revealed as a result of Mr Costigan's investigation. Indeed, Mr Costigan's investigation rather overtook that because, shortly after I had mentioned that matter to the Secretary to my Department, Mr Costigan commenced his investigation. I was not aware of the matters referred to between March 1978 and July 1979. I think the rest of the question is not applicable.

The fact of the matter is that it was at the initiative of the Crown Solicitor at the time that this joint management review was set up. That joint management review has now looked at the whole area of the Crown Solicitor's Division and recommendations have been made which have strengthened the role of the Crown Solicitor's Central Office and, in particular, there has been the appointment of a divisional manager responsible for supervision of the deputies' offices around Australia.

         —The matter of the drought was raised in the Senate when last it sat. Concern was expressed about the difficulties facing a large part of rural Australia. Unfortunately it is true that those difficulties have not been eased over the last week and a half by the hoped-for rain. Last week the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, announced new measures which augment the existing relief measures which are shared by the Commonwealth and the States. These measures were discussed when the matter was last raised in the Senate. As Senator Lewis indicated in his question, interest payments on debt at rates of interest exceeding 12 per cent are to be subsidised by the Commonwealth. This will be done totally by the Commonwealth. In other words, this does not fall within the broader, standard arrangements which are cost shared by the Commonwealth and the States. In the same way the Commonwealth will be the sole provider for the 50 per cent subsidy on the purchases of fodder for livestock.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is true that these arrangements are open-ended in one sense, in that there is no quantitative limit placed on the extent of aid which might be provided under these measures. Clearly, however, there is a practical limit in terms of the amount of fodder and the amount of borrowing which farmers are likely to wish to undertake, particularly as they are to carry the first 12 per cent of interest which, at a time when rural incomes are being so severely dented, is still a very heavy burden for them. As I understand it, the arrangement is not open-ended as to time. My understanding is that it is restricted to the period in which there is a declaration of drought. That will vary from area to area. One hopes that the period of relief offered will be very short indeed, but we are subject to the seasons with respect to that. I will get clarification on that last point. I was not at the Cabinet meeting at which the details of these measures were finalised. It is my understanding that they are open-ended as to quantum but that there is a restriction as to time, which is the restriction as to when the drought finally breaks. I will have to obtain details of the estimated cost of these measures. I have seen a figure of $100m but I am not sure whether it relates to those two measures or to wider measures. I will have to chase a little further the question of cost which was raised by the honourable senator in his question.

Is the Leader of the Government aware that these letters, which have come from eminent professors at Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge universities, would have been received by the Prime Minister in June, yet up to now, some three months later, he has still not replied? Is it not a fact that the Federal Government's complete inaction on taking a statesmanlike lead in preserving South West Tasmania contradicts the fact that the Federal Government has explicitly recognised the national and international value of South West Tasmania by listing it on the National Estate and nominating it for World Heritage listing? In the light of highly qualified legal opinions from prominent Queen's Counsel and even the Attorney-General's Department which have unequivocally stated that the Federal Government has the power to save the Franklin River right now, can the Minister inform the Senate as to when the Federal Government will override an insignificant State Premier-one who owes his position to something less than 100,000 voters out of an Australian population of 15 million and one who is presently overseeing the destruction of the Franklin River-and ensure that a vital piece of international heritage is rescued?

         —I assume that Senator Watson is referring to the proposed change for next year-1983-in processing arrangements for claims submitted by chemists for their dispensing under both the National Health Scheme and arrangements for repatriation benefits. The current keyboard equipment used to process pharamaceutical benefits claims is reaching the end of its effective life and is becoming difficult to maintain. In fact, I am advised that the current data entry equipment maintenance contractor has indicated that maintenance beyond the end of 1983 cannot be guaranteed. A new system of processing claims is being developed. This system is being designed to be more efficient, to require fewer staff and to reduce the amount of clerical coding work currently required at chemists. Of course, if the amount of coding work is reduced one would hope that the claims could be processed more expeditiously.

        A basic objective of the system is to reduce the time taken to pay chemists' claims. The Pharmpay system is presently at an advanced stage of development. It is scheduled for pilot testing in Victoria during the first half of 1983 and a phased national implementation program is scheduled for the second half of that year. I believe that those points cover the concerns expressed by Senator Watson . If any of the matters which are worrying him are not covered by my answer perhaps he could raise them by way of a supplementary question.

It may not be appropriate during Question Time to try to set out for my colleague-in spite of the interest which I know he has in this matter-all the initiatives that have been taken to try to address and overcome illiteracy, particularly adult illiteracy, in Australia.

         —Is the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment aware of an article appearing in today's Sydney Morning Herald wherein it is alleged that 24 internationally eminent scientists have written to the Prime Minister expressing concern over the proposed hydro-electric dam in South West Tasmania? The scientists pointed to archaelogical evidence of Aboriginal cave dwellers fifteen to twenty thousand years ago, evidence of man's most southerly existence at the time of the last Ice Age. The Oxford Research Director, Mr Derek Roe, wrote to Mr Malcolm Fraser:

         —Senator Bonner would be aware that earlier in Question Time today a question of a similar kind was asked. However, it did not cover some of the points raised by my colleague in his question. Senator Bonner asked a question relating particularly to the Aboriginal pre-history which may be lost if the caves in South West Tasmania are flooded. Honourable senators would appreciate the interest Senator Bonner has in this matter and his concern at such a possibility. The Tasmanian Government has made a decision to flood the Franklin River and to construct a hydro-electric dam, as honourable senators will know. It is within the powers of the State Government to proceed and to carry out this work. However, I would deplore the destruction of any sites of significance to Aboriginal Australians. In fact, I deplore the destruction of any sites of significance and I take the opportunity to voice concern at such a possibility.

        The problem is that responsibility for land use and management decisions concerning State-owned land is primarily that of the State. However, since 1975 it has been this Government's policy to assist the Tasmanian Government to establish a national park of world significance in South West Tasmania to include a substantial wilderness area. This policy has been publicly reaffirmed several times and the Commonwealth has supported nomination of a large part of South West Tasmania to the World Heritage List. Having taken that action, the Government would now support the preservation of the wilderness and of course the sites which are of concern to Senator Bonner. I understand that the nomination of South West Tasmania will be considered by the World Heritage Committee in November this year.

Does the Government consider that the compulsory acquisition from and exploitation of resource discoveries of the private sector by the public sector is likely to inhibit further expansion and development of Australia's natural resources given the high cost and high risk of resource exploration, particularly at a time of fragile world metal and mineral markets and a particularly low demand for diamonds?

As to the first part of the honourable senator's question, the Government has heard of the plans that he has mentioned. The suggestion is that the Western Australian Labor Party might intervene, but the precise details of the Opposition's intentions are not known at this moment and therefore it is very difficult to comment on them. Because of that it is very difficult to answer the second question, which is how much it would cost. Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned $150m. It could well cost that but I am not able to verify it. As to the third component of the question, the Government firmly believes that the implementation of such a plan would have damaging effects, as pointed out by Senator Crichton- Browne.

I refer to the Government's recent decision not to grant any meaningful assistance to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in that company's hour of trouble. How does the Government reconcile its attitude to the level of protection for the steel industry with the level of protection for the car manufacturing industry? Would the Minister agree that prima facie it seems unfair that the Government should apparently willingly protect the automotive industry, which is almost wholly dominated by transnational companies, and not help Australia's largest company? Does the level of protection afforded to the motor car industry-there is a tariff of 57.5 per cent and strict quotas-seem generous when compared with the 10 per cent tariff protection of all steel imports? Does the Government not consider it arrogant on the part of General Motors-Holden's Ltd to oppose increased protection for the steel industry under these circumstances? Finally, does the Government not have a spark of gratitude in its heart for the $3,000m crude oil levy that it receives from the Bass Strait fields that were developed almost entirely at the expense of BHP at a time when few experts in this country were prepared to concede that there was much likelihood of finding oil in Australia?

         —Senator Siddons's question is based on a series of false assumptions. The assumption that the Government has not sought to assist the steel industry is quite wrong, and he should know that. He ought to know, for example, that the Temporary Assistance Authority, having made an analysis, recommended a much lesser situation. He ought also to be aware that the Government's decision in the Budget context to allow companies to group their costs and profits and their general expenditure will enable BHP to combine its oil and its steel operation figures and, therefore, enable it to do something that it regards as very significant; that is, to provide significant new capital inflow into the steel industry for the future. The ability to combine company figures is a very significant benefit. Therefore, I reject entirely the situation as Senator Siddons has described it. Pending a full inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission, the Government has agreed that the level of imports should be maintained at the existing level. It has also taken the action which I outlined previously.

        I am quite astonished by the vigour of Senator Siddons's attack on the car industry in Australia. I should have thought that an industry which provides such massive direct and indirect employment benefits to Australia would be one that he would want to see fully protected. I should have thought that an industry which forms the basis for our defence industry as well as the rest of our manufacturing industry would deserve better than the kind of criticism that flowed from him. Therefore, I find the basis of the question totally wrong and I reject it.

I was simply dealing with a question put to me suggesting, as far as I can recollect, that the officers of my Department knew about the full ramifications of the bottom-of -the-harbour schemes when they were dealing with this file in Perth or, indeed, when it was referred to Canberra. I was simply pointing out that, although they knew that it was a very important case, there were other cases of a similar kind . The figures the Opposition has bandied about refer to thousands of billions of dollars worth of losses, or something like that. It was that sort of question, based upon these wildly exaggerated figures that Senator Ryan and her leader have been purveying. I was simply trying to put the matter into some perspective in saying that these people did not have full knowledge, that full knowledge of what was happening would have been held by the Taxation Office and not by them. That was all I was saying. While we are dealing with these figures that Senator Ryan and her colleagues have been bandying about, I point out that the fact of the matter is that the figure assessed by the Taxation Office as the amount of taxation losses resulting from bottom-of-the-harbour schemes is around $450m. That is a very large figure. It is the only official figure. Somehow or other that figure has been inflated by the Leader of the Opposition and others and has reached some fantastic figure involving billions of dollars.

         —Maintaining live foot and mouth virus within the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong is a matter which has raised concern among some sectors of rural industry. That concern has been reflected in questions asked in this place by Senator Lewis and by the honourable senator who has just resumed his seat. In response to those questions I have examined the matter from time to time. My understanding is that there is no cause for concern . This matter has been considered very carefully. A great deal of money has been expended on the laboratory at Geelong to ensure that Australia is in a position to protect its essential livestock industry. The availability of the virus is a part of being able to cope with any possible outbreak of foot and mouth disease- something which we fortunately have been able to avoid in this country by having very careful quarantine procedures. However, I will again go over the material which is available and get an authoritative reply for the honourable senator on this important question. I stress that it is a matter which has been raised over a period. I think something like $150m has been spent with respect to this project. It has been done with the most careful examination by the most expert people in Australia. I think there is no real cause for concern.

         —My attention has certainly been drawn to the Gunn plan, as it has been called by Senator Archer in his question, which is a proposal which was put forward by Sir William Gunn some time ago to enhance the meat industry of Australia. It is a proposal which contains some suggestions which have given rise to some controversy within the meat industry. For example, Sir William has suggested that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation be replaced with a non-statutory authority. He has suggested that $100m would have to be found in the first year of operation of the scheme, with industry having to find $25m of that. Large parts of the meat industry at the moment would not welcome our seeking to raise another $25m from them. Sir William has urged that there should be a single seller to markets which have a single purchaser, such as Korea and Japan. He has made a whole series of other suggestions which, as I say, have given rise to both interest and some controversy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The question of the future marketing strategy for the meat industry has received a lot of discussion recently by producers. I think that Sir William Gunn's proposal has been something of a catalyst in leading to that discussion. The executive of the Cattle Council of Australia has published a national marketing strategy which attempts to pull together elements of that proposal and ideas from a number of other sources. My advice is that the new marketing strategy will be presented for endorsement to the Cattle Council's half-yearly conference in October. While Mr Nixon has been taking a very close interest and has had discussions with Sir William Gunn and a number of industry leaders about the proposal, the proper procedure at this stage is seen by him to be for the proposal to be discussed by the Cattle Council. I understand that that is what is intended by the association. At the moment the matter is still in the hands of industry. The Government feels that it is some way short of having to take a final position on the proposals which are currently being discussed but awaits with considerable interest the conclusion of the consideration which is being given to those proposals at the moment by industry.

         —Earlier during Question Time Senator Hamer asked a question about the need for provisions in industrial law which might restrict people with criminal records from participating in the management of unions. I made reference to the fact that in the companies legislation which has been passed by this Parliament there were provisions which placed considerable restrictions on those with criminal records participating in the management of companies. Just to make a little more definite the answer which I gave earlier, I refer the Senate to section 227 of the Companies Act which refers to the fact that a person who is insolvent cannot act as a director or promoter of a company and that people who have committed a variety of offences cannot act as directors or promoters of companies, including people who have been convicted for an offence involving fraud or dishonesty which is punishable by imprisonment for a period of not less than three months. As I said in answer to the question, conviction for an offence of that sort can lead to disqualification for a period of five years after conviction or after release from prison. I simply say again that the presence of those provisions in the companies legislation seems particularly apt. This is the sort of provision which I am sure many people would feel is appropriate in relation to the trade union movement.

It is expected that these will be available for issue next winter. I should add that the Deputy Commissioner is not aware of any real complaints from members of the Force or their unions on this matter. Action was initiated by the Commissioner himself. I should also add that members of the AFP have recently been issued with new high quality cold weather jackets and where permanent guard posts have been established, such as around Parliament House and certain embassies, or in the embassy area, provision has been made for heating.

         —Earlier in Question Time Senator Townley asked a question about the importation of live foot and mouth virus into Australia. To expand further on the answer which I gave, the position is that the design of the laboratories incorporates the very best microbiological security technology available and will enable any exotic disease agent, including foot and mouth disease virus, to be handled safely in the laboratories. The Government has decided that in principle that virus may be imported to the laboratories when their microbiological security is fully tested and found to be satisfactory. That policy is in line with recommendations made by the Australian Agricultural Council. However, the final decision on whether to import live viruses will take into account latest scientific developments in the field of foot and mouth disease, diagnosis and control, and this will include the state of development of the genetically engineered foot and mouth disease vaccines. In the intervening period it is proposed to consult fully livestock industry groups. A National Farmers Federation forum was held on the subject in late August and a group containing independent experts has been established to assess the laboratories' security.

         —In commenting on the subject matter of this matter of public importance the Sydney Morning Herald, on 26 August, stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What the man in the street will find hard to understand is the virtual immunity enjoyed by those people who have been instrumental in allowing the tax evasion industry to show such a staggering growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course the Sydney Morning Herald is not alone in raising that fundamental point about what the average Australian-whose taxes have increased very significantly under this Government-feels about the immunity which is extended to some people who have allowed the tax evasion industry to develop in the way in which it has. As the honourable member for Canning, Mr Bungey, put it on Friday, 3 September: 'There is no way that Senator Durack and his department head, Mr Neaves, can stay untouched. I think it is completely inconsistent for them both to stay'. The honourable member for Wilmot, Mr Burr, at the same time put it this way: 'Senator Durack should voluntarily stand down pending a full investigation, with the powers of a judicial inquiry, into the Attorney-General' s Department'. Of course those are just views of ordinary men in the Parliament but they reflect the concern of ordinary men in the street. Let me remind the Senate of the facts relating to the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes which were first detected by the Taxation Office in 1973 when a taxation investigator, Mr Todman, prepared material and gave it to the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth. That Office sought an opinion from the then Mr Brinsden Q.C. who advised that the promoter and two others involved should be charged with a breach of section 86 (e) of the Crimes Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        By August 1975 the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth was instructed to proceed with the case as soon as possible. Nothing was done. As the Royal Commissioner, Mr Costigan, said, the file lay undisturbed in the bottom of the drawer for five years. The case involved tax avoidance schemes which accounted for hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid tax. That case would have been a major test case for the revenue which, I would have thought, it was the duty of the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) of this country to be most astute to protect. After all, what could be a more prime responsibility for the Treasurer and the Attorney-General than to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth Government? This Government, as Professor Mathews has pointed out on a number of occasions, has shown great zeal in saving little items of expenditure, but no evidence of zeal has been shown in protecting the revenue of the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The case which the Opposition again puts on this matter is that from 1977 on the Attorney-General should have informed himself about what his Office was doing, as a service department-as he describes it-to the Taxation Office and the Treasury, about these issues. The answer to that is: 'Well, look, I didn't know anything about it. I, the principal law officer of the Commonwealth, knew nothing about it'. The defence of the Attorney-General of Australia, the first law officer, to this charge of ignoring the manifest shortcomings of his Department, of ignoring what was not being done to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, is: 'Ignorance is bliss in my case. I remained ignorant; it is a blissful state to be in'. The clear point is, and this is reflected in the passage I read from the Age editorial, that by his actions or inactions as the principal law officer of the Commonwealth, the Attorney-General encouraged the proliferation of these schemes. If he says it was not a matter of major public importance, a matter of major concern, one would have thought he would have been aware of the various reports of the Taxation Commissioner during that time that showed a steady concern about the proliferation of tax avoidance schemes. Not only that, in 1973-74 the report of the Taxation Commissioner complained about the lack of staff to investigate tax avoidance schemes. Those things are, of course, in the Treasurer's bailiwick. At the same time we are told today that there was a shortage of staff in the Crown Solicitor's Office to look at these schemes, and again the shortage of staff related to Government policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the Costigan report reveals grave failure to act by the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's Office and, indeed, by implication, the Attorney-General. It makes it quite clear that the responsibility extends to the highest levels of the Department and ultimately to the Minister responsible. Since the publication of the report there has been further evidence that the Attorney-General's ignorance was not confined to the Perth office of the Crown Solicitor. The Sydney Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office was involved and asked for an opinion on a tax avoidance scheme in 1976. The opinion by Mr Lockhart, Q.C., was that prosecutions should be launched under the existing law. Nothing, again, was done by the Crown Solicitor's Office. The Attorney again says today that it was not a matter which he had brought to his attention or about which he inquired.
       </para>
       <para>
        One might ask what other schemes are involved and in what other offices has inaction of the same kind occurred. If Perth was involved Sydney would have been involved-that was obvious. But one would ask, by way of rhetorical question, was Senator Durack aware of the Lockhart opinion and, if not, why not? We understand from Question Time today that he was not aware until relatively recently. We accept that Senator Durack may not have had the slightest idea what his Department was doing. But the question then remains: Why is he a Minister in the Government if he has no idea what his Department is doing about this matter of greatest public importance? As I said, sins are those of omission and relying, as it were, on ignorance. By his own admission he neither knew nor cared what was going on in his own Department. As the Age put it on--

        Well, perhaps that is a very high standard which one might expect in some country like the United Kingdom. But we have got used to not expecting it from this Government. The Costigan report has led to evidence of affairs in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Sydney. Evidence keeps trickling out day by day. We ask: When will the Attorney-General begin to take responsibility for some of these matters?
       </para>
       <para>
        What the Attorney-General does, of course, is to say, first of all: 'Ignorance is bliss; I knew nothing about it'. Secondly, he hides behind section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act-the most shabby performance I have ever heard from a Minister in this Parliament. It is quite clear that section 16 of the tax Act, the so-called secrecy provision, provides no real smoke-screen even for the present Attorney-General. Of course, what section 16 does is to prevent from being revealed the particular details of tax returns and names of persons paying tax. That is a legitimate provision in that sense. But what Senator Durack says in answer to that is that he was not allowed to know. That is absolute rubbish and the Attorney-General ought to recognise it. He could have informed himself of the general progress of cases in his Crown Solicitor's Division but he did not bother. That is clear from what he said both at Question Time and in public appearances in relation to this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts are that between 1975 and 1980 the opinions of at least four or five Queen's Counsel were available which advised that the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes could be prosecuted under the existing law. Even today in the Liberal Party in Western Australia there is suddenly a growing enthusiasm to prosecute schemes under the existing law as an alternative to legislation which is said to impose a degree of retrospectivity. But I hope that Senator Durack, the Minister responsible, will tell us whether he knew about these opinions and when he knew about them. He has been singularly vague when answering questions about them. If he did not know about them, why did he not? Did he try to find out whether legal advice had been sought by officers of his Department and what that legal advice was? It is nonsense to suggest that the Attorney did not know anything of what was going on. In answers to questions, what he has alleged in fact is that either he never talks to or visits officers of his Department or, if he does, he does not hear or take any notice of what they say. The emphasis I want to make is that the Perth matter should have involved a major test case for the revenue. That did not happen and the Attorney-General claims ignorance as an excuse.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the report of the Costigan Royal Commission two relatively minor officials of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth, and the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth, Mr Massie, were suspended. That is not a sufficient solution . The Attorney-General informed us at Question Time today that Mr Bennet has suggested that no reprehensible action or conduct took place in the Central Office of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor. We find that very surprising in view of the comments made by the Costigan Royal Commission. But who announced the suspension of the two officers in Perth? It was none other than Mr Alan Neaves, the present Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department who was Crown Solicitor from 1975 to 1979. The Costigan Royal Commission was highly critical of the role played by the Crown Solicitor in the whole affair which centred around the Perth office. If Mr Costigan had known he might very properly have been critical of the role of the Crown Solicitor at that time in what happened in the Sydney office of the Deputy Crown Solicitor. The report of the Costigan Royal Commission states:
       </para>
       <para>
        On 3 April 1979, the Crown Solicitor wrote formally to the Taxation Office advising that the evidence-

       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        was insufficient. The letter did not condescend to particulars. It could not have done. At that time there was no-one in the Crown Solicitor's Office who had a grasp of the facts sufficient to allow the particularising of the supposed deficincies
       </para>
       <para>
        There was nobody in the Crown Solicitor's Office in all that time who could be described as having had a grasp of the facts. One might add the present Attorney -General to that. The fact is that the Attorney-General's defence to the charge that not one single prosecution was launched between 1976 and 1982, in spite of all the legal advice, was that his Department had a different view. That was the defence given in the Senate when this matter was first raised at Question Time following the publication of the Costigan report. The defence now raised in subsequent discourse by the Attorney-General is not that the Attorney-General's Department had a different view but that the Attorney-General just did not know about it all. The passage which I just quoted from the report of the Costigan Royal Commission clearly discredits the advice of the Crown Solicitor in this matter. The question arises: Why are not Mr Neaves and other senior officers in the Crown Solicitor's Office at the time being forced to take some responsibility for what happened? The suspension of Mr Bercove, Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Massie is but a sop in this matter. It is not enough. One would have thought the buck stops much higher-in the Minister's office. I repeat, the Minister has made a number of attempts to lay a smoke screen in relation to this matter. Quite recently, on 5 September, on the Channel 9 program Sunday he tried to evade some responsibility by blaming the Taxation Office and, by implication, the Treasurer.

        The question of the Tax Act is administered by the Treasurer. He is the Minister the Commissioner of Taxation goes to. Now we as a Department, a service Department, we act on instructions from the Commissioner of Taxation.

        What he should have said was: 'We do not act on instructions from the Commissioner of Taxation. We have had them since 1975 and we do not act on them. That is why tax avoidance has flourished in this country'. On Channel 9 he said further:

        So the Attorney-General could update the whole statement. He continued:

       <para>
        The Tax Office was presumably getting more knowledge of these types of cases over the years and it was the Tax Office-they were the ones who had the knowledge. They were the ones who ultimately went to the Minister, the Treasurer , and said 'Look we want to do something about it'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the evidence is quite to the contrary. The Australian Taxation Office went to the Crown Solicitor's Office and said 'We want to do something about it' , but nothing happened as a consequence in Perth, Sydney or any of the other capital city offices which will no doubt need to be the subject of investigation in the not too distant future. I have been referring to the more recent attempts to muddy the waters in relation to the function of the Taxation Office, as against that of the Crown Solicitor's Office, and to suggest that all of the knowledge resided in the Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor's Office was just dozing away as usual. The second defence offered by the Attorney is to bring an action for libel against the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). I suppose that is because he rightly suspects that the sorry history of this affair-the reasons for the inaction and the delays in prosecuting tax avoiders-is coming out.
       </para>
       <para>
        A joint management review was undertaken by P.A. Consulting Services Pty Ltd into the operation of the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department and a report on that was delivered in June 1980. It has been on the desk of the Attorney-General, presumably, for 26 months. Very little has been done about it. That fact is clearly evidenced by the answers given to questions here today and on other occasions. The review revealed serious defects in the operation of the Crown Solicitor's Office. It was highly critical of delays and inefficiencies and, of course, drew particular attention to delays in prosecuting tax avoidance offences. The report stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Recovery of outstanding revenue becomes less successful.
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on to speak of the consequences of inadequate work in the Department- just further evidence of continuing maladministration in the Crown Solicitor's Office. The pathetic attempts of the Attorney to say that he was unaware of matters in his Department thus become more and more laughable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, we come to the Minister's quaint references to the notion of ministerial responsibility, as he sees it. Ministerial responsibility was clearly defined--

        That is something that apparently the Attorney has not considered or, if he has, has taken the course of backing away from.

Perhaps he should also refer to some of the standards which apply in the United Kingdom. From this Government we have had about five versions of what is meant by ministerial responsibility. The Attorney-General jumps from one to another. Finally, in a pathetic interjection, he comes up with the opinion of some journalist in the Age in regard to the conduct of ministerial responsibility.

Therefore, it is rather difficult to fill the time available to answer the honourable senator. The matter is so similar to matters already debated at great length in the Senate a fortnight ago. Senator Evans appears to be ready to rise rapidly to follow me. I hope that he will be able to enliven the debate a little for the benefit of honourable senators taking part or listening to it, but, on the performance of his leader, the matter does not seem to contain anything that is very new. I suppose that one of my tasks this afternoon will be to re-answer many of the arguments that Senator Button has brought forth again. It becomes a little wearisome dealing with the same argument and subject over and over, but I guess that is to be my fate this afternoon.

       <para>
        Senator Button suggests that I am to be criticised because I said that I knew nothing about the mismanagement over a particular period of a tax file in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth. I suppose that something new since we had the earlier debate is that on a Nationwide program reference has been made to a file and opinion given in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Sydney. The honourable senator asks why I did not know about that either. The fact is that I did not know about either the Brinsden opinion or the Lockhart opinion until recently. The reason is that the officers of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office, although within my Department, deal with a large number of cases. That is the business of the officers; they do not keep telling me what they are doing from day to day or from week to week. This is the most childish conception of ministerial responsibility. How on earth does anybody believe in this day and age, with departments as large as they are and with the enormous activities of government, that Ministers can know or ought to know of all the ramifications of the actions of their departments. I find it utterly incredible that anybody would have such a notion. Yet here we have people who masquerade as an alternative government believing that this is the way modern government operates .
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter goes a lot further than that in these cases-I know this upsets Senator Button; I cannot help that-because these cases involve taxation and there happens to be a provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 16, which places very tight controls on the divulging of information. It also specifically singles out Ministers as not being recipients of information about taxpayers. Mr Costigan accepted that, and the Opposition believes everything that Mr Costigan says. I must qualify that statement. I have pointed out that some of the very important findings of Mr Costigan have still to be proven in a court or in disciplinary tribunals set up under the Public Service Act. I completely dissent from other views of Mr Costigan; for example, that there was no need for the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. The Opposition accepts all this. It accepts everything from Mr Costigan, except for one important finding. The Opposition will not accept his finding in regard to the impact of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act in relation to the information given to Ministers by the Australian Taxation Office and by the Attorney-General's Department. Why does the Opposition regard Mr Costigan as the ultimate authority on all the matters that he dealt with, except one. It does not like this one finding of Mr Costigan because it is in favour of Ministers of this Government-the Treasurer and myself. The Opposition says it does not accept that. I wonder whether anybody can accept the bona fides of the Opposition in this whole matter when it does not take that point of view.

         —Mr Costigan found that section 16, in the way it was interpreted and applied, did have the effect to which I have referred. Whether that is right or wrong is another matter. The fact is that through the whole history of this matter the Crown Solicitor took the view that it did have such an effect. Mr Costigan accepted that. For goodness sake, I do not know how one could go further behind the findings. I think that explains the matter. I have said that I was not aware-I could not have been aware-of these matters. I do not believe that the Opposition is asserting that I am not being honest in that. It is saying I should have known. I have already shown how, because of the way in which the matter was traditionally dealt with, I could not have known.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Opposition assumes that the way in which the Government should have tackled tax avoidance, or evasion, was to prosecute in those cases referred to as being in the Perth or Sydney files. The fact of the matter is that this particular form of tax avoidance or evasion, known as the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, was only one of a countless number of such schemes. I am told that something in the order of 100 different forms of artificial tax avoidance schemes proliferated during the years we are discussing. As I pointed out the other day, they commenced in the early 1970s and one of the first and worst examples was the Curran scheme, which became evident during the time of the Labor Government. I am not saying that because the Labor Government did not do anything about it that justifies this Government's doing nothing. Senator Haines seems to get upset when I mention this. That is the very reverse of what I am saying. I am saying that when these matters really became evident and the full picture was given to this Government and the Treasurer, Mr Howard, he instigated and the Government adopted a new vigorous and active policy of tackling these tax avoidance schemes with specific legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the policy that Treasurer Howard introduced and the schedules tabled in the Senate a fortnight ago reveal the wide number of measures that this Government took over the years to tackle and to stamp out these schemes. Admittedly, the Commissioner of Taxation did refer a bottom-of-the-harbour case, which he thought was a good test case, to the DCS Office in Perth in 1975 and I do not justify the mismanagement that occurred in that case. The Commissioner of Taxation had found that prosecution was not progressing in that case for the simple reason that the evidence was not sufficient, and that maybe if the Perth office had got on with it it may have been able to obtain further evidence. When the Commissioner of Taxation found that the proliferation of this scheme was becoming a serious matter, he then took the scheme to the Treasurer and the Government decided it would tackle the scheme by legislation. The legislation is the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. I think everybody agrees that it has been highly successful in stamping out this form of tax evasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, prosecutions may have been of some benefit in arresting the development of the scheme. I do not know; it is hypothetical. Certainly prosecution, as such, was no long term answer to this particular scheme. In any event, prosecutions involve investigations, committal proceedings, trials by jury and so on. They take a great deal of time and a great many resources. Probably each case would have to be dealt with separately. There were probably thousands of these cases. The idea that they could be resolved by prosecution is quite unsustainable. The proper way to deal with these cases was the way in which the Government decided to deal with them and the way in which we dealt with them, and the proof is the success that the Government had in dealing with them by means of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. I should like to refer to the actions that the Government has decided to take on my recommendations. This is an attack on me, and I believe that I should refer again to the actions that the Government has taken in response to Mr Costigan's findings. First and foremost, we have decided to set up a special prosecutor and a special task force with the function and responsibility of investigating cases that will be identified by the Commissioner of Taxation as worthy of prosecution, if possible -they must be investigated further, and the question will arise as to whether there should be prosecutions-and then conducting the prosecutions in those cases in which they find there is sufficient evidence to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before deciding to set up the special prosecutor, the Government had already retained Mr Gleeson as a special adviser in these bottom-of the-harbour cases. The Perth case, which was identified by the Commissioner of Taxation as a major test case-this was reaffirmed by him-was put together by an officer from the central office who went to Perth. He spent 80 hours putting the case together. The brief was delivered to Mr Gleeson for his advice. In the light of Mr Costigan's views expressed on that case, the Senate might be interested to know that Mr Gleeson has advised us that further inquiries are necessary before that prosecution can proceed.

        The Government also decided to have an independent inquiry into the professional competence of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth and the supervision of that office by the central office in Canberra. That is a matter which is obviously of great concern to the Opposition. The Opposition has been asking many questions about the supervision and the adequacy of the central office. The adequacy of the supervision of the central office of the Crown Solicitor will be part of the terms of that inquiry. I am able to inform the Senate this afternoon that the President of the Law Council of Australia has nominated Mr Tony Smith, who will no doubt be well known to Senator Button as a Melbourne solicitor of high standing, a former president of the Law Institute of Victoria and a treasurer of the Law Council of Australia. Mr Smith will be conducting that inquiry. I hope that he will be able to commence it in the very near future. I shall be seeking his report as soon as possible on the Perth office and on the supervision of that office from Canberra. I have also indicated to Mr McKay, the President of the Law Council of Australia, that after Mr Smith has looked at the Perth office and supervision in Canberra it may well be desirable that he should do a spot audit of some other office of the Crown Solicitor as well, but that is a matter which I shall discuss with him in due course.

He is to be judged by the way in which he acts and the way that the Government acts when such a matter is brought to his attention and I believe the Government's record in response to this matter should find favour with the Senate.

         —The Attorney-General, Senator Durack, seems a little wounded about the Opposition raising this matter again today. Let me tell him that an awful lot of people are wounded about the fact that he continues to sit here occupying a ministerial seat after the scandals that have been revealed by the events of the last few weeks. Particularly wounded are the seven million Australian taxpayers who, each of them, are and have been forced to pay somewhere between extra hundreds of dollars and even, perhaps, extra thousands of dollars-depending on how it is calculated-by virtue of this Government's failure to effectively prosecute one particular notorious class of tax avoidance -tax evasion schemes, the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes that came prominently to departmental and public attention at least from 1977 or 1978.

        I suppose that it is fair to say that what began as only a mutter of demands for the Attorney-General's resignation has become over the last two weeks something rather more approaching a roar. It is easy to see why that has happened when one witnesses the blinkered self-righteousness, the blinkered, blinking indifference demonstrated by the Attorney-General today to the nature of his responsibilities and to the nature of the fault that he has perpetrated, been responsible for, over the last few years of his stewardship in his role. The roar of demands for his resignation has come from the editorials of about 10 major Australian newspapers. It has come as well-I do not know whether one can describe it as a roar or a squeak in this case-from Senator Withers, Mr Peacock, Mr Burr and Mr Bungey, on the Government's own side.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that these cries can no longer simply be ignored in the way in which they are being ignored by the Attorney-General here today. Following the cries which came first from the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, the cries have now extended right across the political spectrum and appear across the full range of responsible organs of public opinion. The point that every one of these responses has been making is that the buck simply has to stop somewhere if our system of democracy is any longer to deserve that name, and that in the Westminster style of democracy that we continue for better or for worse to observe, in most respects, the proper place for that particular buck to stop in the kind of circumstances evident in this case is with the Minister himself.

        To say that the blame in this case rests not with the Minister but with his Department, but then to say that within the Department it is not the departmental head who shares the responsibility-even though it is evident that in this case he personally bears a large measure of the blame-but that the blame should be allocated down the tree somewhere to the desk officers who are immediately concerned, is simply to make a farce of the whole system. The buck passes, the fault passes, and we end up with what an editorial in the new Queensland newspaper, the Daily Sun, very aptly described on 30 August 1982 as a system of no-fault democracy. That is what we have as a result of this; a system of no-fault democracy in which the buck is constantly on the move and certainly does not rest where it should-on the Minister's desk.

        Two particular claims have been made by Senator Durack and those few on the Government side who have been heard to publicly defend him about the position as it stands in the aftermath of the Costigan report. The first kind of claim that has been made is that the Westminster system in its purer British form might be applicable to this sort of situation but that the pure Westminster system does not apply in Australia. The second kind of defence that has been made is that to the extent that any kind of doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility is applicable in Australia today, it is one that depends on individual ministerial culpability-the personal failings of the Minister concerned-and that there is no question of personal failings in this case. Let me make as my contribution to this debate what I hope will be the effective demolition of both those propositions-firstly, that the Westminster system is not applicable in its British form in Australia in relation to responsibility and, secondly, that there is no element of personal failing or culpability so far as Senator Durack is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the first issue, there may be some differences in the Westminster system as it applied in Australia, not least those which are demanded by the existence of the Senate playing a role which has no exact equivalent in the United Kingdom . But the Government is very quick to rely on the operation of Westminster conventions in Australia when it suits its purpose to do so. No one has been quicker to rely on Westminster conventions and the Westminster traditions of responsible government than Senator Durack. I remind him, if he is prepared to be reminded on this issue, of what he was constantly heard to say during the debate on the freedom of information legislation about the justification for non -effective access by the public and interest groups to the files that existed within department's because there was a system of ministerial responsibility in which the buck stopped with the Minister and could not be cast off to individual public servants. I also remind Senator Durack of what he and others on the Government side have been saying about the inapplicability of the concept of fixed term parliaments because of the system of Westminster-style responsible government that operates-and operates properly-in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly, Malcolm Fraser-Senator Durack's leader pro tem-was in no doubt about what the Westminster system meant in its application to Australia in his much quoted statement. Let me read some of it. It appears in the book entitled 'Who runs Australia?', being the proceedings of the thirty-eighth summer school of the Australian Institute of Political Science in 1972. On page 182 of that document Malcolm Fraser states:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is certainly true that ministers cannot be aware of everything that occurs in their departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I interpolate that he readily acknowledges, as we on this side readily acknowledge, the force of what Senator Durack stated to be the childish proposition that, of course, Ministers cannot be aware of every small thing that goes on in their departments. Nobody disputes that. But Malcolm Fraser accepted that point and went on to state:
       </para>
       <para>
        They ought to be aware of all the major matters and therefore can be clearly and directly responsible for them. But if a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia, and if the Minister were unaware of it, that minister should accept responsibilty for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further down the page, relevant to the claim of the irrelevance of Westminster to Australia, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It might be said that this used to be the position but that experience in other countries and in America has made it outdated. Well, if this is the claim, it shows a complete misunderstanding of the difference between the British system of government and the American system, in which the separation of powers dominates.
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 200 of the same volume Mr Fraser states:
       </para>
       <para>
        There are people who think that the doctrine of ministerial responsibility is an outdated and an outworn one, whether from misuse or disuse or for any other reason. I still believe it to be a valid and honourable and proper doctrine. If it does not work as it should, I suggest that instead of turning the system upside down we should give some thought to seeing how the doctrine of ministerial responsibility could be made to work in practice in the way it should in theory.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does the Attorney-General, anyone else on his side or Malcolm Fraser himself now repudiate that statement? The Coombs report in 1976 stated that a Minister ought to resign if 'the action which stands condemned was theirs, or taken on their direction, or was action with which they ought obviously to have been concerned' . Again, there is that element of responsibility if the nature of the subject matter is such that it ought to demand this kind of ministerial attention.
       </para>
       <para>
        To dismiss, as Senator Sir John Carrick did today, the Lord Carrington example is again to misunderstand and misapply the Westminster system as it is now operating. There was no suggestion of direct and immediate personal culpability in relation to Carrington. Rather the suggestion was that the Foreign Office would be discredited so long as he remained in office because of the obvious ineffectiveness of its advance warning system. That was why Carrington resigned. The reason was not that he personally had given any false or wrong advice to the Government but that he felt that his continued presence on the stage would discredit the Government. Senator Sir John Carrick, in accepting the utility of the Carrington example, of course points to the continued power of the Westminster conventions and their applicability in Australia. But in misstating the operation of that convention he effectively served to tap another nail into Senator Durack's coffin. What happened in the Carrington case is exactly, for the sorts of reasons that were relevant in that case, what we say should be happening here.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Durack has been much less clear than his colleagues about what the Westminster system is all about. On 3 September he said that he had been reading up about it only in the last week. Now he has made up his mind what it is about. He says that it is about is how a Minister reacts when something is brought to his attention. We will see in a moment how he reacts. I simply make the point that that perception of the ministerial responsibility doctrine is a very innovative one in Australian constitutional jurisprudence, owing no credit to any forebears in literature or elsewhere, and being, if fact, a very recent invention of the last seven days, of the Attorney-General himself.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality is that any system of democracy which operates on the basis of a parliamentary system and responsible government must operate in a way that the buck stops somewhere. It is in the sort of case that is very much in issue now that the buck ought to stop with the Minister. The buck should stop with the Minister in three situations. The first is where the Minister is obviously personally culpable because of some affirmative action which he idenfensibly has taken. Nobody is suggesting that that is in issue here. Secondly, it is the case that someone is personally culpable and should resign when he negligently fails to act in a way that all the circumstances as they exist at the time demand that he should act. The third circumstances in which a Minister ought to resign, on a proper view of the operation of his convention in Australia today, is in circumstances where a major blunder is made on a matter of real importance to the country and not a minor peccadillo buried somewhere within the bowels of the department. We readily acknowledge that that cannot be right. But when a major blunder is made and when the matter is of real importance-as is the case with this loss of hundreds and perhaps thousands of millions of dollars through failure to prosecute tax avoidance schemes-the Minister's responsibility is clear.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Durack does not rest-nor do his supporters-with the defence that the ministerial responsibility convention is inapplicable in Australia. They go on to say that to the extent that it is applicable, it is only applicable in circumstances in which the Minister is personally culpable and has demonstrated some obvious personal failing. Senator Durack, of course, denies-those speaking on his behalf deny-that there has been any such failing. They all seem to be- Senator Durack particularly-under the delusion that he has been neither incompetent nor negligent in the conduct of his portfolio. That is a claim which simply cannot stand up. He has repeatedly claimed that he first became generally aware of bottom-of-the-harbour prosecutions-again he has made the point in Question Time today-only with the McCabe report and only fully aware of the Perth major test case after the tabling of the Costigan report last week. Senator Durack seems to fail to appreciate that the failure to ask the right questions when any reasonable person would be asking questions is just as much a matter of personal culpability as being caught with your fingers in the till. Culpability can arise through the negligent discharge of one's duties.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that while the Attorney could be forgiven for not asking those questions up until 1977 or 1978 when, as John Howard said in his Press statement in June, these schemes really started to take off and first came to public attention and their degree of iniquity was appreciated, it seems to me, to the Opposition and to the great mass of editorial writers and Australians who are witnessing this debate, that that sort of defence simply cannot hold up over that period. It certainly cannot hold up in the context of the run-up to the 1980 enactment of the crimes tax offences legislation. The whole point was that the claim was being made that no prosecution could stand up and that the other techniques available had all failed and would all fail if they went to court, so there had to be legislation. If the Attorney did not satisfy himself about things at that time he was, in our view, negligent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation is that the Attorney is caught on a three-horned dilemma. If he did in fact ask what was going on in 1978 to 1980, on that hypothesis, of course he has been lying now in what he has told the Senate today and what he has said over the last three weeks. Secondly, on the second hypothesis, if he did ask what was going on and he settled for the answer that he then got from his Department, that part of the dilemma sets him up as obviously someone, to be blunt about it, who is a fool in accepting that advice. On the third hypothesis, if he did not ask what was going on, in all the circumstances as they existed at the time and as they exist now, he is negligent. The Attorney has to have it one of those three ways. If he resists, as he is no doubt entitled to, the suggestion that he is lying, that is one thing. The only other options are that he has either been foolish or negligent. Either way the substance of this matter of public importance is clearly demonstrated.

        The totally unsatisfactory and inadequate performance of the Attorney-General in relation to the issues raised by the Costigan Report.

        What we have heard this afternoon has been a somewhat pathetic rehash of a motion which was debated in this chamber the week before last. That motion was unsuccessful. This debate is as uninteresting and lacking in novelty as perhaps someone who suggests that tax evasion-tax avoidance schemes are still a major problem in Australia. What we are talking about, I suppose, arising from the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union are two major points. One is tax evasion. In relation to that, the necessary steps include closing the gaps in the legislation, recovering the tax, if possible, and prosecuting offenders when that is appropriate. I believe that not even the Opposition in its most ambitious, in its most hopeful, moments could suggest that this Government has not been active in amending the legislation to close the gaps, in taking steps to endeavour to recover the tax, and has not been taking steps to conduct prosecutions when they are appropriate.

         —I will come to the record of the Australian Labor Party in this matter in a minute. Up there, Khemlani! Let us turn to the second point, namely, the administration of the Attorney-General's Department and the issue of ministerial responsibility. They are the issues which I presume are the ones to which the Opposition is referring. They have nothing to do with the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and their mates in that union who participate in the formation of Labor Party policy and vote in relation to various matters, the subject matter of that report.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let us look at the tax avoidance industry. I think that everyone would accept that since 1980 that industry has been killed. It is dead, I think its death can be shown by the fact that one of its principal promoters, one of the principal people involved in it, recently passed some cheques which bounced. That is a fair indication of how dead the industry has become. There are two issues involved in this matter. One is the recovery of tax which has been avoided. I think the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has outlined clearly this afternoon and in other statements the steps which have been taken in relation to that and I do not need to dwell on it. In relation to the administration of the Attorney- General's Department, again the Attorney has outlined in considerable detail the very sequence of a variety of steps taken by him to ensure that any deficiencies in the administration of the Department are rectified and that those who have committed breaches of their obligations are, in the appropriate way, placed on trial in relation to those breaches. Notwithstanding the fact that the Attorney has taken all of those steps, notwithstanding the fact that this Government has made more amendments to the tax legislation to cover the loopholes as each of them have appeared than has any previous government, the Australian Labor Party wants to criticise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the Labor record in this field, the record of the people who are making these criticisms. I suppose we could say that they claim that they acted with the speed of light. Yet we hear that on 1 December 1974 the then Labor Treasurer, Mr Crean, announced that the Government was considering amending the law to cover the Curran scheme. That announcement was made on 1 December 1974. By the time they went out of office 12 months later they had not done a thing to amend the law in relation to the Curran scheme. Twelve months from the time they announced they would take steps to amend the law they were still considering it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at another matter in this track record of humbug. We are told- Senator Button said this this afternoon-that they first discovered the bottom-of -the-harbour schemes in 1973. Yet in 1975, two years later, they got around to authorising a prosecution. For 12 months nothing was done about the Curran scheme. It took them two years, apparently-from 1973 until 1975-to get around to authorising launching one prosecution. Then in the next six months they did not follow it up because, under their administration, it was permitted to lie in the bottom drawer of the desk of an officer in Western Australia. Let us just have a look at the record of the people who are throwing criticisms around this chamber . Let us just remember that the sorts of actions to which I have just referred are from the same group who brought us the Khemlani and Iraqi breakfast affairs. Let us just wonder with what honesty and with what integrity they can attack the present Attorney-General. I would rather adopt the attitude which was adopted by the Australian in an editorial dated 7 July 1982. I think that sums up the attitude of many Australians to the work which has been done by this Attorney- General. The editorial states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's Attorney-General, Senator Durack, deserves the thanks of our business community for the agreement he has reached with the US Government on the extraterritorial application of American anti-trust laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even more importantly, the editorial goes on to state:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . what has been achieved is of great value and reflects considerable credit on Senator Durack. He is one of the least flamboyant of politicians but, as he has again shown--
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise the words 'again shown'-
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is well served through having him as our Attorney-General.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part of the misconception in relation to this matter arises from the fact that people do not appear to have a clear idea of the real nature of ministerial responsibility. Those people include the noisy one who has been trying to interject all the time to drown out my voice while I am speaking and have the floor. I refer to Senator Evans. Let me just point to what the real nature of ministerial responsibility is. I believe it was extremely well set out in paragraph 4.22 of a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        No part of the Westminster system has been so thoroughly criticised, nor has any part so thoroughly changed, as the doctrine of individual--
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise 'individual'-
       </para>
       <para>
        ministerial responsibility. It must be remembered that this doctrine developed in the days when departments of state were small and it was a reasonable assumption that ministers of state were familiar with everything that went on in their departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Paragraph 4.30 of that report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In our view it is clear that the theory and practice of individual ministerial responsibility bear increasingly little relationship to each other. The short answer to those who have expressed views that freedom of information legislation will adversely affect the operation of the doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility is that they are in fact worrying about something which has long ceased to exist in practice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress those words 'long ceased to exist'. One of the authors of that report is the honourable senator across the chamber who is attempting to interject. Let us get back to the facts of ministerial responsibility. Let me refer to what Professor Gunn has said. I have many quotations to use but I will use only a few of them. It is incredible, considering the amount of written work that has been done, the findings of Senate committees and so on, that people still continue to put up what is humbug and what, at the risk of being unparliamentary, I could call deceitful in the public debate which has taken place in relation to Senator Durack. Professor Gunn, Professor of Public Administration at Strathclyde University, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        By the early 1960s there was general agreement among British academics that the responsibility of Ministers for the actions of their departmental civil servants was one of the weaker conventions of the British Constitution. Finer had demonstrated that it was increasingly rare for Ministers to resign . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Professor Gunn went on a little later to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet if responsibility no longer implied culpability it was still seen as requiring answerability--
       </para>
       <para>
        That is where the mistake occurs. That is where the real difference lies. The difference lies between the collective responsibility of the government responsible to the lower House of the parliament and the individual ministerial accountability of each Minister to either House of the parliament. Professor Gunn continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        so that the Minister and only the Minister was expected to explain and account to Parliament for his department's actions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Example has been given many times of Lord Peter Carrington's resignation earlier this year in relation to the Falkland Islands crisis. I do not believe this matter has been accurately referred to by Opposition speakers. Lord Carrington said that in his view much of the criticism was unfounded. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been responsible for the conduct of that policy and I think it right that I should resign.

         —The honourable senator tailors his argument according to his purpose. That is just about it. In the Australian Journal of Public Administration the present Prime Minister said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It has always been difficult for a minister to be aware of-let alone directly involved in-every exercise of the powers conferred upon him. I do not know why this ministerial inability to be Superman should surprise anyone.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the sort of thing that has been written recently by the current Prime Minister. I go on to quote from the third edition of The British Cabinet by John Paul Mackintosh, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        One meaning that does cause some confusion is the alleged obligation on a minister to resign when he or one of his subordinates has blundered.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . where the fault lay with a subordinate and the Cabinet was prepared to stand by the minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this situation--
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise the following words-
       </para>
       <para>
        there had never been any constitutional obligation to resign.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what the third edition of J. P. Mackintosh's book states. Yet we have heard all this humbug and misrepresentation by various Labor speakers calling upon the British Westminster system of high principle and resignation to apply. Let it apply. It is set out there. There are many other examples which I can quote. In summary, what we have is a situation where very considerable action has been taken on tax avoidance. Action has been taken on the allegations of wrong-doing by various departmental officers. An active and quietly effective Attorney-General has, I believe, carefully moved through the taking of those actions. We have had a massive misunderstanding of the nature of ministerial responsibility and a misleading of the public as to what that is. We have a situation where no act of commission or omission has been shown.

         —Yes, the painters and dockers are also a matter of public importance. I point out to Senator Teague that at least the painters and dockers attack their own. In fact, one could say that they are doing some people a public service by getting rid of one or two of them. On the other hand, the people who take part in tax evasion are hurting everybody. Senator Evans mentioned earlier that taxpayers generally object to the fact that they are paying higher taxes because of tax evasion. I venture to say that pensioners and beneficiaries are not too chuffed at the fact that their pensions and benefits are kept unnecessarily low because the Government's coffers are depleted by the failure to pay in a particular amount of money. Whether the amount is hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars is irrelevant: Money is not going into the Government coffers for use where it is needed. That is a matter of public importance. The matter was raised by the Royal Commissioner, Mr Costigan, in his latest report on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The issues raised there have to do with topics such as ministerial responsibility, or lack of it, tax evasion and the part played in encouraging tax evasion by incompetence, lethargy, and apathy on the part of some sections of the Attorney-General's Department.

        Senator Peter Rae made the point that honourable senators on this side of the House have misrepresented the concept of ministerial responsibility. Certainly, the Westminster system argues for full responsibility for actions and omissions occurring within a department, limiting those actions to major matters. Certain senators and members on the Government side have been rather flexible over the years in their attitude to ministerial responsibility. It has been pointed out in previous debates that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made the point that it is certainly true-he said this in 1972-that Ministers cannot be aware of everything that occurs within their departments. I for one, and my colleagues I am sure, would not disagree with that any more than we would disagree with the argument that parents cannot be held responsible for everything that their children do. But parents who neglect to pay any attention at all to what their children are doing and who allow them to run riot and to do as they please-

         —As Senator Mason said, over a period of years, must be held responsible. That is the point that honourable senators on this side of the House have been arguing with regard to ministerial responsibility. As Mr Fraser pointed out in 1972, Ministers ought to be aware of all major matters and, therefore, can be clearly and directly responsible for them. He said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . if a major blunder occurred in a department of real importance to Australia-
       </para>
       <para>
        I presume he means the blunder and not the department-
       </para>
       <para>
        and if the Minister were unaware of it, that Minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign.
       </para>
       <para>
        One wonders how much more major a blunder has to be than one which costs the country hundreds of millions of dollars. It was interesting to hear Senator Peter Rae argue strongly in defence of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), which of course he is entitled to do, when only recently he was particularly angry at certain malfunctions in other departments of this Government, particularly in relation to the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd matter, which, as I recall, concerned something like only $1m. However, the Prime Minister's attitude to ministerial responsibility has been somewhat flexible or at least it has changed over the years. By 1978 he was arguing that ministerial inability to be supermen should not surprise anyone. Of course we are not asking that. We are not expecting a Minister to know what every twopenny-halfpenny clerk is doing in his department. We do expect him to know what the senior members are doing. Again in 1978 the Prime Minister went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, after all, the very reason for the existence of a Public Service, organised into departments, to act as the Minister's agents.
       </para>
       <para>
        That brings me back to what Senator Evans said earlier about buck-passing. Where does a lack of awareness stop being an important issue? As far as we on this side of the House are concerned the concept of unawareness being a mitigating factor in a blunder as severe as this is just not good enough. For a start the mind positively boggles at where the argument about ignorance could finish. Of course it gives Ministers who are incompetent, dishonest or just plain stupid the opportunity to plead ignorance even if they were not actually ignorant, and worse, it puts into the hands of senior public servants the incentive not to tell their Ministers what they are doing. That simply is not acceptable. Ignorance is no excuse in most other areas of the law and there is no reason why it should be here. It is interesting to note that the Attorney-General at least had second thoughts about where his responsibility lay, having apparently first thought of resigning but then being reported as saying on 27 August that he had decided against resigning. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        In our system, Ministers don't resign unless there is some personal failing and that isn't the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        I consider ignorance of one's department in a matter which leads to depleting government coffers of hundreds of millions of dollars some considerable failing, particularly as this was a failing which took place not on one occasion but over some seven years. The mismanagement in the Crown Solicitor's Office is traceable at least to 1973. Investigation by Mr Todman of the Australian Taxation Office into the first known bottom-of-the-harbour scheme took place in that year. In 1975 the Taxation Office instructed the Perth Deputy Crown Solicitor to commence action as soon as possible which it did not do. From 1978 until 1982-as has already been pointed out-Mr O'Sullivan Jnr placed completed instructions in the bottom drawer of his desk and simply left them there to gather dust. At one stage in 1978 the then Crown Solicitor asked for a written report, did not receive one and did not query this failure to produce what he had asked for even though he was in Perth that year. Again in 1978 the Taxation Office raised with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) the possible need for criminal legislation apparently not because it was needed, as Mr Costigan makes clear, but because it was discouraged by the Crown Solicitor's procrastinations, which included the erroneous advice that there was insufficient evidence to establish a case. In 1979 legal officers in the Taxation Office examined the material and could not understand why the existing law was not being used to redress the situation. In 1980 the Attorney-General received a report as a result of the management review undertaken jointly with the Public Service Board, which said of the Crown Solicitor's Office:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the formal structural organization for handling matters has broken down and there are now confused lines of control and uncertainty about who is responsible . . . for particular matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The same review disclosed that 38 per cent of files were at least a year in arrears, 21 per cent more than two years behind and 10 per cent three or more years in backlog. The Attorney-General took no action to invoke sections 17, 19 or 25 of the Public Service Act, which do enable a Minister, notwithstanding the secrecy provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, to investigate problems. Section 19 in particular empowers the Public Service Board to inter alia:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . enter any department . . . summon any person . . . take evidence on oath . . . require the production of documents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, as I understand it, the Board's view is that it could and would undertake detailed performance evaluations if requested by the Minister. Apparently no such requests were made by the Attorney-General concerning the problems that were becoming more and more evident, in the seven years since the Fraser Government took office, in some of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's offices. It is unfortunate, but it is inescapable, that the failure of the Attorney- General to ensure efficiency in his Department has led to damage not only in dollar terms but also, and most importantly, to the community's social fabric and respect for law and government and just plain honesty. A recent article in the Australian Financial Review made the point:
       </para>
       <para>
        Very large numbers of Australians who once accepted that they had a duty to pay taxes, even while grumbling about the amount, now have been confronted with the spectacle of billions of dollars being ripped off by smart operators, legally or not. They see that many people in the highest income groups feel no obligation to pay any taxes at all and have few scruples about arranging their affairs so as to pay little or nothing. And these people include many of the leading figures in our society, in groups commanding considerable respect. Doctors, lawyers, businessmen, accountants have all been in for their cut.
       </para>
       <para>
        The newspaper did not make the point but apparently knights and television personalities have been in for theirs as well. The Attorney-General must be seen to be responsible for the appalling incompetence in some sections of his Department, if not for its origin, then at least for allowing it to continue. It is my personal belief that the Treasurer, having ignored the advice from two Deputy Commissioners of Taxation that prosecutions could be launched, is also culpable. Some blame also at least lies with the Prime Minister who, having said in 1972 and 1978 that Ministers could not be expected to be aware of all they needed to be aware of in their departments, subsequently did nothing to make their lives any easier or their knowledge any more simple to gain. I think it is appropriate to finish with a comment from another article, this time in the Melbourne Age which, while stating that the record indicates that the Attorney- General is a bad administrator, continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        while there is still no evidence suggesting he knew what bungling was happening beneath him, a good adminstrator runs a tight department and puts the fear of God into those senior bureaucrats who do the day-to-day supervising.

       </para>
       <para>
        The performance of the Attorney-General has been raised in this matter of public importance and this gives me the opportunity to talk about some of the things that the Attorney-General has done. I am quite fascinated to hear someone like Senator Evans-Senator Evans of all people-attacking the Attorney-General in the way that he did today. We in this Senate day after day had to put up with Senator Evans attempting to bludgeon the Attorney-General in relation to the freedom of information legislation. The Attorney-General gave that legislation and Senator Evans's proposals deep consideration and appreciation. He went back to the Cabinet and gained agreement to change certain parts of the legislation. He acted specifically at the request of Senator Evans. Yet Senator Evans stands here today and makes this unwarranted attack on the Attorney-General, an attack totally lacking in substance-a lack of substance which I will come to in due course and which I will establish from the words of Senator Walsh, who sits alongside Senator Evans.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the achievements of the Attorney-General. Firstly, he has been involved in off-shore settlement, including the negotiations with the States, the Premiers Conference agreement and the ultimate protection of the Great Barrier Reef. He has been involved with human rights and civil liberties. He established the Human Rights Commission. He was involved in the establishment of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation which implemented the Hope Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security recommendations. He has also been involved in the complaints against police legislation, the Criminal Investigation Bill and the Crimes Currency Act. He is now involved in proposals for a sentencing council. In the field of individuals' rights he was involved with the proclamation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act which allows appeals to be made by citizens to the Federal Court against decisions of Ministers or bureaucrats on questions of law. I mentioned the freedom of information legislation. He was involved in activities in relation to defamation. In relation to family law, he was involved with the reintroduction of amendments to the family law legislation on the basis of the recommendations of a parliamentary committee which he established. He was also involved in anti- trust arrangements with the United States of America and the introduction of the Foreign Anti-trust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Act. We have that magnificent piece of legislation in relation to statutory interpretation, the Acts Interpretation Act. All sorts of matters have been raised in relation to constitutional reform. The Attorney-General has been involved with legal aid.
       </para>
       <para>
        All sorts of appointments have been made to the benches of the various courts of the land. Let me mention the number of appointments in which the Attorney- General has been involved. The Attorney-General appointed the Chief Justice of the High Court. No criticism has been made anywhere in Australia on that appointment. He appointed four justices to the High Court of Australia. Again we have heard not one word of criticism. I might add that beforehand all sorts of suggestions were made. In fact one day we sat here and heard Senator Evans say good-bye to the Attorney-General on the basis that before we came back to the Parliament the Attorney-General would be on the High Court. That is what Senator Evans was trying to tell the newspapers of Australia. Of course, he was wrong.

        Let me just turn to the subject of this alleged criticism in relation to the handling of so-called tax evasion matters. This Government has done more about tax evasion; this Government has raised the expectations in relation to tax evasion. It has been this Government's actions which have finally brought to the attention of members of the Opposition what the subject has been all about. I can remember standing here and explaining to senators on the other side the problems created by tax evasion and they did not understand what I was talking about. Finally they have worked it all out. Finally it has come through to them. It has done so because this Government set up a royal commission. How can we win ? We set up an investigative body and when the investigative body discloses the sorts of things one would worry about members of the Opposition say: 'Resign'. How can we possibly win? Why do not members of the Opposition read what the Royal Commissioner had to say on these matters? I will quote what he had to say so that it can be recorded in Hansard. At paragraph 128 of Chapter 3 of the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, Mr Costigan said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In taking action it is necessary to remove some of the substantial obstacles that have deterred action in the past. The most significant deterrent has been the inability of the Taxation Office to act in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies to enforce the law. That inability arises because of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It drops a legislative curtain over the knowledge gained by the Taxation Office of the fraud. It impedes investigations. It inhibits redress. Indeed, from my observations the prohibition of section 16 is magnified in the minds of Officers of the Taxation Office so as to give it even greater breadth than it has . . . This should not be allowed to continue.

        Then at paragraph 132 of Chapter 3 he says:

        It is essential that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia should be able to gain full access to taxation information so that he can see the extent to which the Revenue of the Commonwealth may be being affected by fiscal policy, or by the depredations of thieves and rogues. Should any Treasurer in the future seek to misuse the access to information that this would give him, the matter may be redressed by Parliament, and if not by Parliament, by the people at an election. Likewise, the Attorney-General should have free access to all information that comes to the Crown Solicitor's Office, and not be inhibited by the operations of section 16.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will say this about Senator Walsh: It is clear to me from Senator Walsh's questions in this Senate that he understands that the paragraphs I have just quoted in fact make sure that the Attorney-General should be free of criticism. Senator Walsh has turned his vitriol to one particular period. He claims the period was three weeks but in fact it was 15 days. That is all that Senator Walsh has criticised. What he says is that the Attorney-General stands condemned because for 15 days after the report was received he took no action.

         —That is right. Senator Walsh confirms what I have been saying. He said: He left the crooks in charge of the files for 15 days. That is Senator Walsh's criticism. Everyone acknowledges that Senator Walsh understands the significance of these things. So we narrow his criticism down to an allegation that for a period of 15 days the Attorney-General failed to act. That was from 3 August until 18 August. Let me just point out that in a period of 15 days the Department, not just the Attorney-General, had to analyse the report of Mr Costigan, then investigate what evidence was available to support the findings of Mr Costigan and then make a recommendation not to the Attorney-General but to the permanent head because suspension in fact is carried out not by the Attorney -General but by the permanent head. So Senator Walsh has now learned another thing which may interest him, that in fact the Attorney-General is not responsible for the suspension; the permanent head is responsible. So that, Senator Walsh, in your own words, proves conclusively the innocence of the Attorney-General and I say-

It is about time that the Opposition stopped playing politics and engaging in mud-slinging and started to assist this Parliament to demonstrate some leadership to the Australian people. When one listens to the nonsense that we have had to put up with again today-we had to put up with it a week ago-is it any wonder that in particular the young people of Australia are absolutely fed up with politics and politicians? I suggest that it is about time the Senate got down to discussing some of the real issues which are of concern to the people of Australia today. For example, in a question of mine today I mentioned the problems of drought and how we may look after the people of this country who are suffering from those problems. These are national matters which are of vital importance.

        The document read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 in a number of respects. The main amendments proposed by the Bill deal with the levels of penalty for Customs offences. Other amendments are directed at controls over the unloading and handling of cargo, the licensing of depots for short-term holding of goods, the entering of goods and duty exemptions on ships' and aircraft's stores.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would point out to honourable senators that amendments were also made in the other place to incorporate into this Bill provisions specifically directed at controlling the sale and delivery of duty-free goods to intending travellers from duty-free shops operating outside airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Report of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs pointed out inadequacies in the penalties for breaches of the Customs Act. Other inadequacies in Customs Act penalties were highlighted last year in the context of offences committed in the unlawful exportation of horse and kangaroo meat to the United States. As part of the Government's response to those issues, a general review of Customs Act penalties has been undertaken in consultation with the Government's legal advisers. The review took into consideration matters to which I have just referred, the difficulties faced by Customs in supervising the growing flow of goods into and out of Australia, the need for Customs to rely to a significant degree on the integrity of importers and exporters and the magnitude of the rewards that can be obtained from revenue evasion or unlawful import or export activities. It was concluded that the levels of penalties for most non-narcotics Customs offences should be substantially increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill proposes that the penalty for revenue related offences should be up to five times the amount sought to be evaded and not less than two times that amount. For the offences of importing prohibited imports or exporting prohibited exports a maximum penalty equivalent to three times the value of the goods is proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where the amount evaded or the value of the goods cannot be ascertained, however, it is proposed that a maximum penalty of $50,000 should apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is further proposed that this maximum of $50,000 should also be the prescribed penalty for other offences which strike at the very basis of Customs control.
       </para>
       <para>
        Included in this category are offences such as failure by the master of a ship to permit his ship to be boarded or by the pilot of an aircraft to land for boarding, breach of conditions to which any permitted movement of goods under Customs control may be subject in particularly high risk situations and the unlawful interference with containers or goods between the time of landing and their clearance by Customs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of some offences which, while serious, are not amongst the most important, a maximum penalty of $25,000 is proposed. Examples of such offences are the unloading without permission of imported cargo or cargo that has been loaded for export.
       </para>
       <para>
        A maximum penalty of $10,000 is proposed for offences such as failing to comply with conditions to which certain permissions for the importation, exportation or movement of goods is subject and for other offences of equal seriousness.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other proposed maximum penalties include $5,000 for offences such as interfering with Customs seals, $2,000 for offences such as the failure to deliver up imported goods that have been washed ashore or salvaged , and $1,000 for offences such as the failure to furnish export returns and the failure by licensees of warehouses and owners of warehoused goods to observe certain requirements in relation to facilities and documentation.
       </para>
       <para>
        No action is proposed by this Bill in relation to penalties for narcotics offences punishable under section 235 of the Customs Act. Those penalties were reviewed and substantially increased by amendments to the Act in 1977 and 1979.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed penalty increases require consequential adjustments to ensure that Customs prosecutions may be brought in an appropriate court. At present the Act provides that prosecutions involving a pecuniary penalty not exceeding $1,000 may be instituted in courts of summary jurisdiction or in intermediate courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to allow the increased penalties to be recovered without having to institute comparatively minor prosecutions at the Supreme Court level, greater use is to be made of the existing intermediate level of courts by increasing their jurisdictional level to $20,000. The jurisdictional level of courts of summary jurisdiction is to be increased to $5,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other amendments will extend the present system of dealing administratively with relatively minor offences committed by arriving international passengers or crew. It is proposed that the system of administrative settlement should apply also to offences committed by other persons which could lead to forfeiture of goods and where the duty evaded is $500 or less.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes amendments to provisions governing the lodgment and processing of entries of goods for home consumption. The changes simplify, update and remedy defects in the existing provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is proposed that entries for goods lodged with a Collector before the arrival of the carrying ship or aircraft at its first port or airport of call in Australia will become effective for duty purposes on the arrival of the ship or aircraft at that first port or airport. Presently, advance entries are not effective until the goods actually arrive at the port or airport to which they have been consigned. This requirement has given rise to anomalous situations where identical goods may attract different rates of duty depending on the time of arrival of the carrying ship at various Australian ports. Delays in a ship's movements around Australia may also prevent some of a shipment of identical goods on the same vessel which are discharged at different ports, being entered in time to meet deadlines applying under import quota arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other amendments are proposed to clarify administrative aspects of the lodgment and withdrawal of entries.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further important amendment is the proposed inclusion of a new Part VA in the Act to introduce a new system of licensing of places used as depots for holding imported goods and goods for export prior to their examination by Customs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of the similarity of operation of premises used for the long term warehousing of goods subject to Customs control and the short term holding of goods for examination in depots, the licensing scheme proposed in the Bill is modelled directly on that now applying in respect of warehouses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed new depot licensing provisions set out criteria under which licences may be granted and provide authority for the imposition of conditions, the charging of fees and the exercise of certain disciplinary powers in the event of a breach of the terms of a licence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes amendment of the provisions in the Act dealing with the report, unshipment, placement and movement of imported cargo. These amendments will correct deficiencies in the existing provisions which fail to accommodate modern cargo handling procedures, particularly in relation to containerised cargo.
       </para>
       <para>
        Minor changes are proposed to be made to provisions covering the licensing of Customs warehouses and Customs agents. These changes are designed to overcome administrative difficulties in operating these schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the amendments that were inserted into the Bill in the other place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the inception of duty-free shops, the general authorities in section 40AA of the Customs Act and section 61A of the Excise Act, which allow permissions to be granted for the movement of goods whilst the goods remain under Customs control, have been relied upon to enable duty-free operators to conduct their business at places outside airports. Permissions granted under these sections contained specified conditions to ensure the exportation of the goods. A breach of any condition rendered the shop proprietor liable for any duty on goods not exported.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legal advice has been received that these provisions do not provide the necessary authority for Customs to impose, on shop proprietors and on purchasers , conditions which require that duty-free goods sold to travellers be exported.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments proposed in effect restate, on a valid legal basis, the conditions presently applied to permissions. These conditions place obligations on the shop proprietors to make travellers aware of the conditions with which they are required to comply, to keep records and furnish returns, to produce satisfactory proof of export of goods and to accept liability for payment of duty on goods in respect of which satisfactory proof of export is not produced.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed amendments will not affect the present day-to-day operations of the duty-free industry as no change in the procedures at present being followed is envisaged.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because duty-free shops have the status of being warehouses licensed for the purposes of the Customs Act, other provisions of a more general nature which are included in Part V of the Customs Act also have application in relation to the operation and control of these stores.
       </para>
       <para>
        In response to representations made by the duty-free industry, the Bill provides for all administrative decisions made pursuant to the proposed new provisions to be able to be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill proposes amendments to clarify the duty exemptions applicable to stores for use in ships and aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments have equal application to both the Customs Act and the Excise Act and are designed to ensure that the duty exemptions only apply in respect of ships and aircraft engaged on international voyages or flights.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        The document read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The Remuneration Tribunal's 1982 Review was presented to the Senate on 26 August 1982. Honourable senators will by now be aware that the Government has accepted the Tribunal's recommendations and determinations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making its review, the Tribunal took into account the state of the national economy, and within proper limits, the effects which its decision may have on it . It gave careful consideration to the matters raised by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer concerning the necessity to achieve a moderation of the rate of wage and salary increases in the community in order to avoid an immediate rise in unemployment, to reduce inflationary pressures and to avoid further damage to our international competitiveness. The Tribunal was persuaded that exceptional circumstances exist and consequently made determinations and recommendations based on a general level of increase in salaries of 7 per cent. Remuneration directed at the reimbursement of outgoings and expenditure, for example Electorate Allowance and Travelling Allowance, has been adjusted according to the Tribunal's assessment of what is necessary to achieve a proper reimbursement . It would be inequitable for persons within the Tribunal's jurisdiction to suffer a penalty in respect of expenditure made by them in carrying out their duties and responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Remuneration Tribunal's willingness to consider the national interest gives a clear lead to other wage-fixing bodies. The Government hopes that wage-fixing bodies throughout Australia will also be prepared to consider the wider ramifications of their decisions. At a time when wage rises are pricing people out of a tight labour market, wage-fixing authorities have a responsibility to take into account the economic climate in which they operate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In accepting the Remuneration Tribunal's determinations, the Government has also sought to give a lead. Honourable senators will be aware that there is considerable public support for the proposition that Parliamentarians should ' practise what they preach' with regard to wage restraint.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is greatly encouraged by decisions already taken by a number of large Australian companies to restrain increases in salaries. If the example set by the Government is followed by other employers and accepted by wage and salary earners generally, it will play an important part in achieving the levels of wage restraint that Australia needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 11 of the Bill implements the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to the salaries and allowances of the Judiciary.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw particular attention to Clause 6 of the Bill which changes the eligibility for the ''Canberra allowance'' payable to Justices of the High Court . The Act as it stands provides for an annual allowance to be payable to a Justice of the High Court who held office on 1 July 1980 and who has continued to have his sole or principal place of residence outside Canberra. The allowance is not payable to a Justice who has his sole or principal place of residence in Canberra or to a Justice appointed after 1 July 1980.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its 1981 and 1982 reviews, the Remuneration Tribunal recommended that the limitation to Justices appointed before 1 July 1980 should be removed. The Government has looked at the matter again in the light of the Tribunal's views and representations which it has received on this subject. The State Governments , especially those of the less populous States, have been strongly of the view that the Justices should not all be compelled to live in Canberra. The argument runs that Justices who continue to live in their home States will keep in touch with the shades of thought and attitude around the nation which help the High Court in tune with the federal nature of Australia. The representations have come not only from the States but also from the Law Council, from bodies representing the legal profession and from individual members of the legal profession.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the light of these expressions of opinion, the Government now believes that it would be appropriate to adopt the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal and to remove the bar to the payment of the ''Canberra allowance'' to High Court Justices appointed after 1 July 1980 who choose to retain their sole or principal place of residence outside Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not intended that the allowance be payable to Justices who take up residence in Canberra, or to a Justice who, having taken up residence in Canberra, then decides to return to live elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part III of the Bill proposes to amend the Ministers of State Act 1952 by increasing the annual sum appropriated for Ministerial salaries to enable the increases recommended by the Tribunal to be payable. It is proposed to increase this sum from $452,000 to $575,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The opportunity has also been taken to propose certain amendments to the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973 which are unrelated to the Tribunal's Review.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first of these amendments is designed to remove Northern Territory and Norfolk Island public offices and members of the National Aboriginal Conference from the scope of the appropriation provisions of the Act. It is not appropriate , nor was it ever intended, that payments to the holders of these public offices be made from the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund, but rather that the responsible governments and the Conference respectively should provide the funds required.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes to empower the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to disallow determinations by the Tribunal in respect of its members. This power currently lies with the Commonwealth Parliament, but it is considered to be more appropriately a matter for the assembly. The disallowance power would not extend to variation of the Tribunal's determinations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also proposed to bring within the provisions of sub-section 7 (11) of the Act the office of member of the National Aboriginal Conference. The effect of this amendment would be to treat members of the Conference in the same way as full-time Commonwealth employees. Sub-section 7 (11) provides that full-time Commonwealth employees are not entitled to receive remuneration in respect of a part-time public office unless a specific exemption is made by regulation. A further minor amendment proposed in respect of the National Aboriginal Conference is that it will now be included within the Act as a body the offices of which are within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. This has previously been achieved by regulation and the proposed amendment is of a machinery nature only.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill seeks to extend the Tribunal's jurisdiction with respect to certain Commonwealth-owned or controlled companies. The employees of Commonwealth companies limited by guarantee have been outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction but there is no reason why this should be so and it is now proposed that they be included. Few such offices are involved and existing arrangements would not be upset by the amendment as it would only make it possible for such offices to be referred to the Tribunal in terms of a specific request.

        The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen arrangements for the protection of Australia's animals and plants, and world wildlife generally; by improving the effectiveness of our import and export controls.
       </para>
       <para>
        The uniqueness of Australia's flora and fauna places a special responsibility on all of us to ensure that we do our utmost to avoid species becoming extinct. Regrettably, many species of our flora and fauna have become extinct in recent times. The causes include thoughtlessness, over-exploitation and simple lack of knowledge and understanding. Possibly the most devastating impact has been through the destruction of natural habitat, which for many species has made survival impossible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the years there has been a steadily increasing public concern about wildlife protection. Governments have responded with a range of legislative and administrative measures. Australia has traditionally set high standards of protection, and in some respects we have provided world leadership. Nonetheless the Government believes that continuing vigilance is necessary, particularly to strengthen existing arrangements wherever possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The actions of non-government organisations and individual Australians obviously are most important in protecting our wildlife. Governments must also help by providing factual information, in educational activities and in developing and implementing appropriate legislation. In this context I would like to refer to some recent initiatives.

The first volume of the Zoological Catalogue of Australia has also been completed.

        The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service continues to provide the Government with advice relating to wildlife and nature protection. The Service participates in planning the implementation of wildlife protection measures in co-operation with relevant State, Territorial and Commonwealth Authorities. It supports an extensive program of research about Australian wildlife, and contributes significantly to conservation awareness through its publication program.

        The Great Barrier Reef Region contains an enormous variety of living species. Three Sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park have now been declared. Work is proceeding systematically towards the progressive declaration of further sections.

        A particularly significant legislative achievement in 1980 was the enactment of the Whale Protection Act, which prohibits the taking of cetaceans in Australian waters, or by Australians elsewhere. At meetings of the International Whaling Commission, Australia continues to play a most significant role in reducing the catch quotas, and in arguing for a complete moratorium on harvesting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst I have outlined some Commonwealth activities on nature conservation, honourable senators will be well aware of the many important activities of the States and Territories in the protection of wildlife, and the strong collaboration between all governments through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers.

       <para>
        International Trade The protection of wildlife has a dimension, which extends beyond our own shores. In recognition of its international obligations, Australia is party to a number of nature conservation treaties and agreements. One is the Migratory Birds Agreement with Japan which provides for the protection of many species of migratory birds, and for associated research. Australia was the first nation to accede to the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance under which Kakadu National Park is listed. We were also the first to ratify the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the efforts of nations upholding the provisions of international conventions, there is a flourishing illicit trade in wildlife. This trade contributes considerably towards the extinction of numerous species. Some idea of the commercial pressures may be gained from the payments involved. $50,000 may be paid for a coat from the skin of the ocelot, or the rare snow leopard. Pairs of live Australian parrots have been sold for up to $10,000 overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another dimension to this illegal trade is the appalling cruelty and wildlife losses involved. The extraordinary measures taken by smugglers to conceal wildlife in transit impose much suffering and injury to the creatures involved. The actual death rate among smuggled birds can be as high as 90 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        None-the-less the ease of international travel and the lure of high profits, provides a strong temptation to many people to participate in this distasteful trade. The uniqueness of Australian wildlife continues to provide ready markets overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        CITES In 1973, Australia and about 70 countries negotiated the Convention on Internationl Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Convention is commonly known as CITES. It arose from world wide concern about the adverse effects of unregulated trade on the world's wildlife. Australia ratified CITES in 1976, upon promulgation of the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations. These regulations and the Prohibited Imports and Prohibited Exports Regulations under the Customs Act, and various Acts and Ordinances relating to Australia's external Territories, provide the present legislative basis for the control of overseas trade in wildlife.
       </para>
       <para>
        The New Legislation The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill consolidates wildlife trade controls into a single Act, and allows the Commonwealth to more effectively implement the objects of CITES.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill is structured around seven Schedules of species in which trade is prohibited or regulated. A permit system will be used to impose conditions appropriate to the status of the species being traded. The Bill provides for maximum penalties of $100,000 or five years imprisonment, plus forfeiture of goods and equipment involved in the case of individuals. The maximum penalty is $200,000 plus forfeiture in the case of organisations. These penalties are appropriate to the high potential rewards involved, and to indications of organised criminal activity in wildlife trafficking. The possibility of a jail sentence is a necessary deterrent, as illegal traffickers customarily offer to pay fines and all other expenses for couriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation found, in its 1976 report on Trafficking in Fauna, that wildlife smuggling occurs in remote areas of Australia. As it is extremely difficult to apprehend persons in the act of illegal smuggling in remote areas, and because it is not possible to prevent all illegal imports through points of entry to Australia, the Bill provides for possession of illegally imported wildlife to be an offence . Similarly, the Bill provides for enforcement officers to have powers of arrest , search and seizure appropriate to the difficult circumstances and isolated areas in which the Bill must be enforced.
       </para>
       <para>
        State and Territory Consultation During preparation of the legislation detailed discussions were held with the relevant State and Territory authorities. These discussions have been particularly helpful in improving the drafting of the Bill . I note also that there has been widespread support by State Conservation Ministers for the Commonwealth to legislate so as to improve the regulation of the international trade in wildlife and wildlife products. Under the Bill, the Minister is required to ensure that the States and Territories continue to be properly consulted on a range of matters where they would have a particular interest-for example, in relation to any amendment to the Schedules which could affect Australian wildlife. It is noteworthy that consultation through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers and other bodies will be necessary for proper implementation of various parts of the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Strict Controls I believe it is important to note that the Bill does not lessen in any way the stance Australia has taken in the past on wildlife protection, either in Australia or overseas. Regarding Australian wildlife and related products, the Bill is based on the premise that commercial trade will only be permitted if it has been conclusively established that such trade will not adversely affect Australian wildlife. There will be no weakening of the strict controls that Australia has traditionally maintained on the export of native fauna. The Bill further extends this protection to our unique native flora.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also important to emphasise that normal commercial trade in agricultural, forestry and fisheries products will not be affected by the Bill. There will be no barrier to the import of presently permitted live aquarium fish. The Bill permits trade between bona-fide zoos and scientific institutions. There is also provision for individuals to become affiliated with scientific institutions for the purposes of research.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill protect endangered wildlife, and wildlife that would be threatened by continuation of unregulated trade. The listings of species and populations of species, in these two Schedules are derived mainly from Appendices I and II to CITES. Further Australian species that are considered to be threatened with extinction have been added to Schedule 1. Trade in Schedule 1 species is limited to that undertaken for scientific purposes, by bona-fide zoos or for commercial trade in captive bred or artificially propagated specimens. Schedule 2 is less stringent in that specimens taken from the wild can be traded commercially if they are taken under an approved management program.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule 3 allows for the regulation of trade in wildlife requiring special protection on grounds such as animal welfare, or to reflect other needs for stringent controls, including those applied by other countries. Trade in Schedule 3 species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances by bona-fide zoos or for scientific purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule 4 lists those commercial species of Australian flora and fauna that are currently exported and for which a permit will not be required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedules 5 and 6 provide for the import of live animals and plants such as farm animals, table birds and fish. These Schedules enable Australian wildlife and its habitat to be protected by preventing the introduction of live animals and plants that could adversely affect the Australian natural environment. Examples of species which have been introduced in the past, and have seriously affected the Australian environment, include rabbits and lantana.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule 7 lists those species of native animals eligible to be treated as household pets for export under strict conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule 8 is the text of CITES.
       </para>
       <para>
        Administration The Bill places responsibility for the policy aspects of regulation of trade in wildlife with the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Administration of the Bill will be undertaken by the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and enforcement will continue to be by the Bureau of Customs and the Australian Federal Police. In line with current practice, the Minister will be able to make arrangements with the States and Territories on various aspects of the Bill, including enforcement by State police forces and wildlife officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, while there are people who argue that nature conservation is a lost cause, beaten by our uncaring and greedy world, I believe it is a cause we can win and are winning. This Bill is a major piece of legislation reinforcing other Government measures developed to conserve Australian fauna and flora, and to ensure that international trade in threatened wildlife is responsibly controlled. It implements a number of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation which reported in 1976 on Trafficking in Fauna. The Bill does not interfere with legitimate commercial trade and it provides for the specialised requirements of science. It provides appropriate penalties to deter those who would profit by illegal trafficking in wildlife. I commend the Bill to honourable senators.

        That the Senate take note of the report.

       <para>
        On 25 March 1982 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the Honourable R. I . Viner M.P., introduced into the House of Representatives the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 and the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill 1982. The Bills were read a third time in the House of Representatives on 22 April 1982 and subsequently introduced into the Senate on 27 April 1982. As honourable senators will be aware, on 5 May 1982 the Senate , as an amendment to the motion that the Bills be now read a second time, resolved to send the Bills to a select committee of the Senate. There are two main issues in this report. One deals with the legal aspects of the legislation and the other with its philosophy and practical ramifications for Australian industrial relations. Because both these aspects are complex and some matters have yet to be resolved, the Committee considers that more time is required to bring up a comprehensive final report and to enable the Committee to reach a final conclusive view on many of the issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Paragraph 2.9, at page 7 of the report, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The majority of witnesses (including those representing many of the employer groups) expressed the opinion that the major purposes which the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 and the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill 1982 are meant to achieve would, in a variety of ways , further disturb the currently unsettled industrial relations climate and would not contribute to industrial peace. The Committee has formed no concluded view on these submissions but, because of their significance in relation to the Committee's terms of reference, wishes to note them at this stage and advise the Senate that it requires further time to evaluate the complex issues which are involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee, during its deliberations became aware that a majority of witnesses, persons and organisations making submissions did not favour the legislation. Nevertheless the Committee concluded that it should not be persuaded by majority opinion but should look at the legislation and its intentions on their merits before forming a conclusion. It has become apparent during the inquiry that even organisations which could not be expected to take public issue with the philosophical orientation of the Bills nevertheless felt the need to draw the attention of the Committee to practical difficulties in the implementation and consequences of the legislation. For example, the Confederation of Australian Industry, in the conclusion to its submissions, told the Committee:
       </para>
       <para>
        As indicated throughout this submission, CAI supports the provisions of the Bill which are the subject of the Select Committee's Terms of Reference, while recognising that in some respects difficulties of practical implementation will arise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other organisations of employers which have made written submissions to the Committee but have not given public evidence have expressed similar reservations . Some are opposed to the legislation outright. Roughly 20 employer organisations wrote to the Committee telling it that they endorsed the CAI submission. Needless to say, all employee organisations which made submissions and/or gave public evidence opposed the principal provisions of the legislation. During the hearing of public evidence it was important to explore the questions to which the Senate, in its resolution of 5 May, had specifically asked the Committee to direct its attention in considering the Bills, namely:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) the desirability or otherwise of encouraging the development of industry- based unions in Australia, and the best methods of providing changes in the structure of Australian Trade Union organisation,
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) whether the provision of 'voluntary unionism' and the removal of power to award preference to unionists will contribute to industrial peace and an improvement of the industrial relations climate, and
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) whether the right of employers to stand down employees as a result of industrial action without reference to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is consistent with modern industrial practices, and will contribute to industrial peace.
       </para>
       <para>
        On one aspect of the question-for example, whether the provision of 'voluntary unionism' would contribute to industrial peace and an improvement in the industrial relations climate-Hansard records the following exchange between Committee members and Mr George Polites of the Confederation of Australian Industry:

         In addressing the Committee specifically about the likelihood of the industry unions provisions of the Bills contributing to industrial peace in the building industry, Mr McLaughlin of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners told the Committee-it is well for honourable senators to reflect on this as the building industry has been one which has experienced industrial disputation over many years-that:
        </para>
        <para>
         If there are talks about having just an industry union such as for the building industry, that is a wide area and I will be quite blunt where our members are concerned. They have told us they will not have a bar of one union in the building industry because they ask who it will be, whether it will be the dim sims or the vodka boys. That is what it boils down to.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is quite clear that moderate craft unions like the ASC and J will fight to the end to avoid being swallowed up by one industry union in the building industry as envisaged by the Government's legislation, irrespective of whether that union is to be the Australian Builders Labourers Federation, the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia or a similar organisation. These are only a fraction of the number of comments, made in evidence or submission before this Committee, which indicate confusion and concern over the impact of the legislation on industrial relations in Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         I turn to the legal aspect. The interim report of the Committee deals with some legal questions which have arisen as a result of part of a submission by Mr A. J . Macken of Melbourne. Mr Macken's submission is included in the report at page 19. Briefly it has been summarised thus:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Bill if enacted would deprive employers, employees, rank and file unionists and the victims of strikes, bans and limitations of work of any present right of recourse to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for an award or to the Federal Court of Australia for an order under existing sections 25, 30 , 32, 35, 140, 141 or 143 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 wherever the conduct complained of is or relates to a prescribed industrial matter, or is or relates to an industrial dispute or industrial question insofar as that dispute or question involves a prescribed industrial matter.
        </para>
        <para>
         Honourable senators will recall that, in the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982, prescribed industrial matter means 'an industrial matter relating to the giving of preference in or in relation to employment to persons by reference to membership of a declared body or organisation'. That is contained in clause 4B(1) of the Bill. The Committee has not taken a final position on Mr Macken's submissions but neither has it had satisfactory answers from the Government in relation to them. In this regard, paragraph 2.7 at page 6 of the report states:
        </para>
        <para>
         Significant legal issues having been raised, the Committee sought the assistance of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Attorney-General's Department in respect of this evidence. The evidence of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations was not helpful on these matters, and the evidence of the Attorney-General's Department was even less helpful. The legal doubts that had been raised were not dispelled by the answers provided by these Departments to the Committee's questions. Subsequently the Committee directed specific written questions to the Attorney-General.
        </para>
        <para>
         They are contained in Appendix 5 of the report. Paragraph 2.7 continues:
        </para>
        <para>
         The responses by the Attorney-General are regarded as being particularly unhelpful, indicating an unwillingness or an inability to answer a number of doubts raised in the evidence relating to the legal ramifications and practical consequences of the Bills.
        </para>
        <para>
         An indication of the other technical and legal questions which the Committee considered should be answered is the list of questions forwarded to the Attorney -General (Senator Durack) and shown on page 45 of the Committee's report. The Committee attempted to find out, as a result of the evidence of Mr Macken, whether Mr Macken's submissions were substantially correct and whether his view of what would happen if the legislation were passed was correct or was considered during the development of the legislation. The Committee also wanted to pursue a number of other technical and legal questions regarding the legislation which only the Government was able to answer. These related to the intent of the legislation, the regulation making power in the legislation-which would be of particular interest to a number of honourable senators on both sides of the chamber-the protection of the legal rights of the individual under the law and so on. At no stage did the Committee get full, open and frank answers from the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations on these questions.
        </para>
        <para>
         One can conclude from an examination of the public evidence that what happened was that the officers of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations shifted responsibility for the legal aspects of the Bill on to the Attorney- General's Department. The Attorney-General's Department then nominated an officer to appear before the Committee. In answer to a question, that officer stated that he had nothing to do with the drafting of the legislation and was not consulted in relation to the drafting of it. Finally, the Committee resolved to send a list of written questions to the Attorney-General. That list appears at page 45 of the interim report. This is absolutely no reflection at all on the officer of the Attorney-General's Department who appeared before the Committee. He was sent by the Attorney-General's Department and, as he stated, he had had nothing to do with the drafting of the legislation and was not consulted about the drafting of it. The list on page 45 of the report gives an indication of some of the questions the Committee thought should be answered to enable it to carry out properly the task the Senate had given it.
        </para>
        <para>
         With the benefit of hindsight, it is now safe to say that the Attorney-General was asked these questions when he was preoccupied with matters not connected with the Committee's inquiry. His responses to the Committee's questions appear at page 49 of the interim report and can now be viewed in light of the circumstances to which I have just alluded. Furthermore, the Attorney-General said that questions four to six related to how the Bill would operate in particular situations that may occur and advised that 'the policy aspects involved should be taken up with the sponsors of the Bill if that has not already been done'. The extent to which the Attorney-General's responses to the Committee are unsatisfactory has to be seen against the question of who should take responsibility for answering questions relating to these Bills. The Committee has not received satisfactory answers from the two departments it has questioned and perhaps, given the workings of the bureaucracy, another department-the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-should have been asked to assist the Committee if, as may well have been the case, it had more to do with the development of this legislation than either of the two departments which the Committee has already questioned.
        </para>
        <para>
         What is clear at present is that neither the Government departments nor the Government itself are rushing forward to volunteer to defend or explain this legislation, nor do any departments appear to want to take responsibility for it . In pursuing these questions the Committee was not attempting to identify who or what department was responsible for the legislation, nor was it looking for a scapegoat. It was pursuing this course for no other reason than to get some explanation of the intent of the legislation and how that legislation would operate in practice. As things now stand, it still has not received those explanations. The list of unanswered questions can be worked out by anybody interested, from a reading of the appendices to the Committee's report. In brief , on the basis of the information before it, the Committee came to the conclusion, also outlined on page 7, as follows:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Committee considers that significant deficiencies appear to exist in the legislation so that even if the purposes for which the legislation was formulated were acceptable to the Senate, it could introduce into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 inherent inconsistencies and further, could produce a number of consequences which could negate certain purposes for which it was drafted.
        </para>
        <para>
         As to whether the purposes for which the legislation was drafted are acceptable, that is another question. The views of the majority of witnesses, including those representing many employer groups, that these purposes would not contribute to industrial peace, have been noted by the Committee, which now requires further time to evaluate the complex issues involved before submitting its final report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later, Mr Deputy President .

         —by leave-I simply intervene to reinforce the remarks of Senator Harradine. I know that some honourable senators may feel that the assignment given to us was not completed. But the point is that it was a valuable exercise to get the various divergent points of view that exist in the industrial field. Particularly it would be wrong to assume that there is a Maginot Line complex among the trade unions and that the existing pattern will remain. Anyone who heard evidence from Simon Crean, representing the Australian Council of Trade Unions, George Campbell, of the Australian Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, and people from some smaller sectors of industry, realised that that was not so.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This is probably not the time to be provocative about dealing with the procedures for trade union amalgamation, but the important thing, as I have said from the outset, with the advent of a new Minister and certain other ideas about continued consultations, is that we shall get a continual compression of the number of trade unions. In saying that, however-Senator Harradine touched on this matter briefly-we must realise that if we seek shotgun marriages between particular unions, with the rivalries in State and Federal jurisdictions, we will have considerable difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pay tribute to Senator Hamer. I know that he had a genuine desire to explore some trade union motivations. He went about it very fairly. For the chairman, the multitude of witnesses, the highly technical evidence and industrial terminology cleared the air considerably. Quite aside from the implications of the Macken opinion, there is no question but that we got involved in the very vexed question of the waterfront and the pandora's box that may or may not be opened with an industrial coverage, and they are things that people must approach very carefully.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that the Committee operated as a safety valve. Many points of view were put. Several senators, at least, might have thought that some major trade union personalities who appeared before the Committee were ogres, but then they realised that they were just normal Australians. I hope that we have held the line for the time being. I am one of those who have a lot of respect for the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee). I know the views of the senior echelon of the ACTU and I believe that the Committee under Senator Harradine has performed a valuable filtering process to clear the air for other things to develop.

       <para>
        The reasons of the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation for not being able to bring down a final report at this time and for an extension of time are set out on pages 5 and 6 of the report and indeed are indicated by the tenor of the report as well. The Committee has now received-I do not know whether it is mentioned in the report-70 submissions, and a number of other letters and documentations have come along, even one as recently as today. It has taken 1,382 pages of public evidence. Much of the evidence deals with issues that go to the very heart of the system of conciliation and arbitration in Australia. To do justice to the effort to those who have prepared thoughtful and sometimes lengthy submissions, and properly to discharge the task we have been set by the Senate, the Committee feels that it needs another seven weeks to produce a final report. I therefore commend the motion to the Senate.

         —The Australian Democrats support the extension of time, although initially we felt that the report could have been completed by this date. The calibre of the submissions, the thought put into them, and the calibre of the people making them, indicates that there is considerable disquiet in the community about this legislation. The bulk of evidence indicated that it would do nothing to improve industrial relations; in fact, the reverse-it would considerably upset them. I want to draw attention particularly to one piece of evidence given in the report by Mr Macken. He says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Good industrial relations in Australia are possible even in industries traditionally regarded as strike prone. For example, Civil and Civic has achieved an enviable record of industrial peace in the building industry by, in the words of a key witness, simple and effective adoption of simple principles such as profit sharing and a concern to ascertain the wishes of people who work in a particular industry and the removal of artificial barriers between management and employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that the Government can legislate until it is blue in the face , but that will not improve industrial relations. We cannot force people to work together. We have to create an environment which is conducive to good industrial relations. In this respect this piece of legislation will do nothing to help the environment of industrial relations. All the evidence is to the contrary. It is to be hoped that the Government will take note of the evidence and of what the Committee has said in its interim report and will try a new tack in order to establish an environment that leads to more consultation and to more concern about the way that industry is organised internally-to encourage, in other words , the principles of industrial democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by congratulating the Chairman, Senator Harradine, who I believe performed a very difficult task extremely well. It is significant that this interim report has the support of three parties represented in this chamber. I think that in itself speaks for the chairmanship of this Committee.

In the gentlest possible way I remind the gentlemen who came here to keep us honest that they expressed the stongest possible view in the strongest possible terms that they would not look at any extension of time. I do that in a very gentle way because it is a reminder that as facts unfold sometimes our view of what is the appropriate course alters.

        Before I seek leave I make one comment on the report and on the comments of Senator Harradine. The report contains some reference to the Attorney-General's Department and to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). Those remarks concern the failure, in the view of the Committee, to obtain what it regards as adequate answers to a series of legal questions addressed to the Attorney-General's Department and to the Attorney. In fairness I think it should be pointed out, as is expressly stated in the Attorney-General's letter which is appendix 6 to the report, that the Committee has a legal consultant to provide it with legal assistance. I quote from the Attorney's letter, which states:

        The primary role of the Attorney-General in relation to Government Bills is, of course, to furnish advice to the Government.

        As a senator who has sat on a number of Senate committees which have been concerned with issues brought foward by the previous Government and issues brought forward by the Government I support, I am familiar with the fact that often difficult legal questions arise. I simply remind the Senate, in the context of these remarks which have been made about the Attorney, that it is a very common practice for Senate committees to seek the views of their legal advisers and of independent counsel when there are issues of law on which they seek guidance. I think that to assume that the Attorney-General should act as counsel to a parliamentary committee is perhaps to misapprehend the function of the Attorney in these matters.

        —I thank the Senate. Interim Report No. 4 of the Costigan Royal Commission consisted of three volumes, only Volume 1 of which was recommended by the Commission for publication. However, the Government is firmly of the view that as much as possible of this report should be published. Mr Costigan wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 6 September 1982 in response to requests from both the Commonwealth and Victorian governments that he examine whether more of the contents of his report could be published. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard his letter which further explains his reasons for advising against publication of certain parts of his report.

       My dear Prime Minister,
      </para>
      <para>
       Both the Commonwealth and the Victorian Governments have inquired whether I would modify the recommendation contained in Interim Report No. 4 that Volumes 2 and 3 of that Report should remain confidential. In making that inquiry it has been suggested that I also consider whether, in the event that I remain of the same opinion that the Report should not be tabled, it would be possible for a summary of these two volumes to be published.
      </para>
      <para>
       To meet this inquiry I have re-read with care both volumes.
      </para>
      <para>
       With one modification, which I shall refer to shortly, it is still my firm view that these volumes should not be published. The events of the last fortnight have strengthened this view. Moreover any summary of the volumes would be rendered meaningless by the need for massive editing and deletion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the reasons for this view can be stated (others cannot because the reasons would themselves reveal confidential information):
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The reports deal with matters which are the subject of current investigation by the Commission. To reveal the nature and direction of those investigations would be counter-productive to the work of the Commission;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) A number of the matters referred to in the two volumes are the subject of proposed or current investigation by law enforcement agencies, some of which have commenced as a direct result of matters ascertained by this Commission. Those investigations, as much as the Commission's investigations, would be prejudiced by the publication of what is presently known;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) It is in the interests of the community that the persons mentioned in the two volumes be dealt with according to law and by the implementation of the normal criminal processes. A fair and proper trial would be impossible should the reports be published. In expressing this view, which I have always held, I find considerable support in the observations of several Judges of the High Court in the recent decision in Hammond v. Woodward.
      </para>
      <para>
       I can see why there is some concern about not publishing these volumes. This springs from the fact that it is public knowledge that the two volumes are in existence and a good deal of speculation has arisen as to their contents, much of it quite unfair to some persons and organisations. It would be quite inaccurate to draw any specific inference as to what names might appear in those volumes, or whether they come from any particular state or territory or country or have associations with any political organisation or group.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think I should say something about the nature and role of interim reports. Particularly in a Commission such a this, which extends over a considerable period of time and covers a vast range of subjects, it is important that from time to time Government should be informed as to the directions in which the Commission is moving and the conclusions it is reaching on specific matters. Indeed it was contemplated that I should do so when I received a major extension of time in early 1981. By being appraised as to these matters in detail Governments may better determine such legislative and administrative initiatives as may be required. For example, there is currently discussion in the highest places concerning the need or otherwise for a Crime Commission. I believe the confidential volumes can be of assistance in these discussions by revealing the type and character of organised crime in our community and identifying means of suppressing it. For such reports to be useful generalities are not adequate: without detailed analysis their value is limited. But, for the reasons given above, unless such analysis remains confidential it cannot be included in a report.
      </para>
      <para>
       The modification I referred to in paragraph 3 above relates to Chapter 10 of the Report contained in Volume 2. Following a request transmitted to me by the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department I have prepared an edited version of this Chapter which I have forwarded to both Governments. It may assist State Attorneys-General and Police Ministers in their current consideration of a Crime Commission. It is for both Governments to determine whether it should be so distributed or whether the publication should be wider.

        —I thank the Senate again. The Royal Commissioner, however, provided an edited version of chapter 10 suitable for publication. These amendments were minor in nature to prevent individuals being identified. Chapter 10 deals with criminal organisation within the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and addresses the strategies which might be adopted to combat organised crime. In this regard the Commonwealth would see the proposed National Crimes Commission as being the appropriate body to pursue the fight against organised crime. This chapter contains very significant material including certain general conclusions of the Commission that would be of interest and a source of enlightenment to the general community if generally available. I therefore table the revised version of chapter 10. I move:

      </para>
      <para>
       I wish to make some remarks on the paper and the accompanying statement. First, there is a serious objection from the Opposition both to the timing of the tabling of this paper and to the adequacy of the documentation involved. On the question of timing, Senator Chaney has already stated that the printed document has been in the Government's hands for only a matter of minutes. Certainly it has been in my hands for a matter of only 10 minutes or, at the most, 15 minutes , which has barely given me time to turn the pages of the document let alone to absorb fully the conclusions and contents that are there set out. There was, however, little point in objecting to the tabling of this document at this stage because undoubtedly it was the Government's intention to table the paper in the other place today. That at least gives us some opportunity to have the document circulated to us in the Senate and to make at least some initial response to it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have made the point, I hope clearly enough, that the non-refusal of leave is not to be taken as assent to the circumstances in which the document has been tabled. I further make the point, so far as timing is concerned, that it is obviously a ploy by the Government to table this particular document with this great flurry of urgent activity today in order to take the gloss off what has been, by all accounts, a very humiliating experience for the Government in the other place today in the context of the censure motion and what, it might not become me to say, was a humiliating experience for the Government with the matter of public importance in the Senate today, but which nonetheless demonstrated again the pitiful incapacity of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to appreciate the nature of his responsibilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Obviously, the subject matter of the document which has just been tabled is of enormous public interest. I will come to that in a moment. Obviously it will command a good deal of media space tomorrow. Equally obviously that space will, at least to some extent, be at the expense of the reporting of the Government's humiliation in this Parliament today. I find it a cynical act on the part of the Government, at such short notice and with so little obvious need for that degree of haste, to put the document down in the way that it has. The second point I make is as to the adequacy of the material presented. We have not-

It is as to those matters that I want to say something briefly. The second matter which shrieks out at one from the document is how inadequate it is in terms of its coverage of the range of matters which are clearly in the missing volumes 2 and 3 of Interim Report No. 4.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The paper before us is simply an edited version of one chapter of those missing volumes, missing in the sense that they have not been made publicly available. It is a chapter concerned with the status of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union as an organised criminal outfit in its own right, a chapter which makes certain recommendations as to the future course of commission of inquiry activities based on the status of that organisation. All the other things which have been the subject of so much intense speculation in recent days have not been the subject of presentation to us now. A lot more could be said about the pros and cons of tabling sensitive material and material which, as the Commissioner says, might well be the subject of further criminal prosecutions and a degree of prejudice to those involved if the publicity runs at this early stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would not wish it to be thought, however, that there is already a well established principle in Australia that no royal commission or similar reports are ever tabled if they name individuals who may subsequently be the subject of criminal prosecution. That has happened on innumerable occasions in the past and will no doubt happen on innumerable occasions in the future. While it is possible to argue in particular cases that the release of names in the form of a report before criminal prosecutions have taken place can interfere with the course of justice, equally it is possible to argue that where a government is potentially embarrassed by some of the names in question rather too much power is placed in the hands of the government by it having the capacity to stop the publication of reports simply on the ground of the likely prosecution of individuals named within them. One suspects, of course, that there is some such motivation lying behind the Government's obvious unwillingness to table other material arising out of volumes 2 and 3 of this report.

The very existence of his outfit has been put at risk by the attitudes of the Fraser Government towards his Commission and the profound embarrassment caused by it.

I say no more than that.

      <para>
       I will speak very briefly on the content of this report because it is hoped that there will be some further opportunity to debate it at some later stage before too much time expires. It seems to come to three conclusions: First, that there is an organised criminal group operating in Australia through the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union; secondly, that the law enforcement agencies in this country have been manifestly inefficient in not only identifying the existence of a national organised criminal outfit but also controlling it; thirdly, that we do need some sort of proper organisation to suppress this particular form of organised crime. The report says, that there are three functions involved in the suppression of such crime: The first is the identification of what is happening; the second is the reporting about what is going on and the third is the taking of action in respect of it. I mention all this because the Government has sought in the accompanying statement that Senator Chaney has put down to link what Mr Costigan is saying to the Government 's own proposal for a national crimes commission as being, and I quote the ministerial statement:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the appropriate body to pursue the fight against organised crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       I simply say no more than this. On my reading of the Costigan report, as brief as it has had to be, I see no justification in anything that Mr Costigan has said for the kind of national crimes commission that this Government seems so bent on implementing. Mr Costigan is undoubtedly saying that there needs to be a continuation of some royal commission-type activity armed with greater investigative powers than his commission has at the moment; secondly, that that body needs to have some reporting responsibilities, both in general terms to government and more specifically to other law enforcement agencies; and, thirdly , that there ought to be some prosecuting arm of such an organisation but not necessarily a prosecuting arm which is formally part of the organisation or, indeed, in any way that closely associated with it. The notion of an all-singing all-dancing national crimes commission which investigates everthing in sight, reports in elaborate and gory detail to the world at large on the progress of those investigations and, simultaneously, has a prosecuting function, is not something that is recommended by Mr Costigan and nothing in my reading of this report, brief as it has been, should I think encourage anyone to draw that particular conclusion.
      </para>
      <para>
       A case there may be for continued ad hoc royal commissions, of which Mr Costigan's has demonstrated itself to be a model; a case there may be for establishing a special prosecutor of the kind that the Attorney-General is proposing to introduce legislation about this week; a case there may be for having even more effective investigative powers attached to some such royal commssion; but a case for a national crimes commission in the way that it has been articulated so far, at least, by the Government-and there has not been any very coherent articulation of it-is simply not made out and indeed some explicit attacks on the United States Crimes Commission model are evident on page 52 of the report that has just been put down in front of us.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are many things to be unhappy about as to the timing of the tabling of this document and its adequacy. I think the most that we should be unhappy about is the way that the Government is so obviously intending, and the way it has signalled its intention, to use this particular chapter as the long-awaited support structure for its ideas about a national crimes commission. I do not believe that his document will give the Government any such support and I have no doubt that the much closer scrutiny that we will now be able to give the document overnight will reinforce that conclusion. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

      <para>
       No Government has ever adopted a policy of expanding the number of staff in the Taxation Office (or any other revenue collecting agency) to the point where every dollar of revenue capable of being collected each year is collected. At the same time it does not make good sense to cut staff to the point where substantial revenue is forgone.

       A similar position applies in respect of my Department which collects large sums of revenue for municipal and territorial type services provided in the Australian Captial Territory.

       The effects of staff numbers on revenue collections are taken into account in seeking and allocating additions to the Department's staff ceiling.

       (1) The 'Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services' (May 1982) undertaken by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs presents a consolidated report of the reviews of the Grant-in-Aid Scheme and of the post- arrival programs and services for migrants. In the course of its reviews the Institute consulted a wide range of statutory, voluntary and other organisations for advice, comment and information: List A (below) provides the names of those organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the conduct of the evaluation the Institute held fourteen community consultations to which a wide range of organisations was invited. These meetings were held in all capital cities and in the regional centres of Newcastle, Wollongong and Geelong. List B (below) presents the names of the organisations of which people in attendance indicated in writing they were members. Organisations already shown in List A are excluded.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further information was obtained by extensive surveys of service providers in the government, voluntary and private sectors as well as of individuals both migrant and non-migrant. A detailed description of these surveys is contained in Chapter 2 of the 'Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services'.

       (2) The complaint reported by Messrs Morris, Greenham and Gilbertson as outlined in the Australian newspaper article referred to was investigated by members of the Australian Federal Police who, at the time, could discover no evidence which might substantiate the allegations made.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) There are 104 passenger cars in the Commonwealth car-with-driver fleet in the Australian Capital Territory. Because of permanent weekly hire-with-driver commitments, vehicles off the road for servicing and repairs and absences of drivers, the average daily availability is about 78.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Because of the need to provide transport for VIP visitors and the daily length of time during which parliament sits, this number is not sufficient to cope with Parliamentary transport requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       The alternative modes of transport are- (a) Hire cars, self-drive Commonwealth cars, self-drive contractors' vehicles
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Hire cars, taxi cabs as a last resort when the Commonwealth car and hire car resources are exhausted.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Hire cars and taxi cabs are used as alternative parliamentary transport. The responsibility for enforcing provisions regarding any external employment of public servants rests with the Departments which employ them. Effective action in this area is generally dependent upon relevant details being provided to the employing department.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The number of 'no contact' reports from private contractors for the period 1 July 1981 to 19 April 1982 in the Australian Capital Territory was 925 which is less than 1% of the total number of jobs allocated to them. Action is in hand which aims at improving performance in this area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Commonwealth cars and hire car contractors are in the main reliable and taxi contractors are reliable in non peak periods. In peak periods, particularly during parliamentary sitings when the demand from both the public and private sectors exceeds the number of vehicles available, the availability of taxi cabs in the Australian Capital Territory is affected and delays and missed pick-ups are occasionally experienced.

       Persons born on Christmas Island on or after 1 October 1958 are Australian citizens. The Christmas Island Amendment Act 1980 which came into effect on 17 December 1980 provides that persons who were ordinarily resident on Christmas Island immediately before the transfer of the Island to Australia on 1 October 1958, who are now ordinarily resident on the Island, in Australia or an external Territory may make a declaration that they wish to acquire Australian citizenship. Forty-six persons have taken advantage of this amendment to acquire Australian citizenship.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additionally, when the Migration Act was extended to Christmas Island on 23 January 1981, a number of persons temporarily living on the Island were subsequently granted resident status and became eligible for the grant of Australian citizenship. Three hundred and nine such persons have applied.
