        —by leave-On behalf of the Opposition, I express our regret at hearing of Senator Durack's illness. I think it is fair to say that, quite apart from periods of the hurly-burly of debate, which have been quite considerable in this chamber in the past week or two and in which Senator Durack has been in the eye of the storm, if I can put it in those terms, most Opposition members regard him as a friend and a respected colleague. There are a lot of theories about the causes of illnesses of this kind. Perhaps sometimes we had a lot of annoyance with Senator Durack because he seemed such an unflappable personality. It is one of the strange ironies that that does not seem to have been the case. We take the opportunity to wish him a speedy recovery and a quick return to the chamber.

We are delighted to know that apparently the attack was a mild one. Having had some intimate knowledge of such attacks, I am quite sure that, if Senator Durack follows the advice of the wonderful people at the Royal Canberra Hospital and of his colleagues and takes things easily, he will return to the fray within a relatively short time. I do not suggest that he will be fit enough or stupid enough to return to the vigours of Australian Rules football after a year, but let me reassure him that, in respect of the kind of attack that he has had, he is capable of a complete recovery. And we wish him just that.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To the Honourable the President and Members of the Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects, namely:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programs,

       <para>
        (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,
       </para>
       <para>
        (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,
       </para>
       <para>
        (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.
       </para>
       <para>
        5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.

       Great Barrier Reef Marine Park

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14 per cent of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.
      </para>
      <para>
       The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.
      </para>
      <para>
       This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.

We the undersigned citizens of Australia, concerned about the high and increasing rate of divorce and family breakdown, convinced that the Family Law Act has weakened marriage by making divorce a trivial matter, the present Act paying scant regard to its own definition of marriage as a life-long union; and believing that the legal bond of marriage should be strengthened.

      </para>
      <para>
       That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised- that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.

      <para>
       This petition of certain citizens of Australia concerned with continuing cuts in Federal Government funding of higher education respectfully showeth that the Federal Government cut-backs in funding have:
      </para>
      <para>
       Made it increasingly difficult for many Australians to contemplate study at a university or college of advanced education;
      </para>
      <para>

       seriously jeopardized Australia's ability to keep pace with and contribute to technological developments in a whole range of areas;

      <para>
       reduced the quantity and quality of community education programs offered, especially in rural colleges; and

       forced universities and colleges of advanced education to cut back on the numbers of staff available to teach existing courses, endangering the quality of education offering and narrowing the range of courses available.

      </para>
      <para>
       1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.
      </para>

       Child Care Services

Is the Minister aware that the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980, which has been referred to by both the Treasurer and the Attorney-General as this Government's answer to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, prescribes criminal penalties for tax avoiders engaged in such schemes, including fines of $50,000 and gaol terms of five years? Was the Minister's statement designed to reassure potential or real tax avoiders in the Liberal Party or was the Minister saying that the Government does not intend ever to use the provisions of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act? Is this the reason that not a single prosecution has ever been launched under this Act?

         —The seriousness with which the Government viewed the bottom-of- the-harbour schemes was evidenced by the legislation which was put to the Parliament and passed in 1980. It was unusual legislation in that it provided for criminal penalties for people who, by stripping companies, had made those companies unable to pay their tax liabilities. I will re-examine the report in the newspapers about what I said in Bendigo to see whether it bears the interpretation given to it by the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, in Bendigo I was referring to the proposed legislation announced by the Government to deal with vendor shareholders who have sold companies which have subsequently been taken to the bottom of the harbour, as the expression goes. The Government announced some time ago-of course this is a matter which is within the province of the Treasurer but I respond to the question because remarks of mine were reported-that vendor shareholders in those circumstances should have a taxation liability. The point I was making in Bendigo was that the proposed new legislation was new legislation not to impose criminal penalties on vendor shareholders but to impose taxation liabilities on vendor shareholders-a distinction that I am sure will be quite clear to the Leader of the Opposition.

         —I ask a question of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, I think, although Senator Chaney may be the responsible Minister. It refers to the draft legislation designed to recover unpaid company taxes from shareholders of companies which evaded these taxes through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Is it true that legislation has been submitted to the Government and should be ready for presentation to the Parliament in one or two weeks' time? I ask whether the provisions of that legislation will be based on or will include the principle embodied in the statement made by Senator Peter Rae in the Senate last Thursday, 9 September, which he described as having been made on behalf of the Government in the party room, namely:

        This does not mean that all people who sell companies at higher than their asset backing are at risk. It is only in those cases where the company's tax liabilities were evaded by fraud.

       <para>
        Will the Minister confirm that it is the Government's intention to base the legislation on that principle or to include that principle? Will the Minister confirm this by reference to a particular example? Let us take a family business which is sold by the shareholder couple who wish to retire. Assume that the couple, on the advice of taxation experts, arrange the sale at a favourable price. The couple invest the proceeds in a country cottage and retreat to it to enjoy their retirement. They were totally unaware of the tax liability of the company they sold, which has been avoided through a bottom-of-the-harbour technique. Will the Minister advise whether the Government intends that people who find themselves in the position of such a totally innocent couple will be personally liable for the evaded company tax?

It is in the process of preparation and the Government hopes to introduce it as soon as possible. I shall not put a precise time on it because I think that the Treasurer would have the responsibility for doing that, and probably would not wish to do so anyway. As to the precise form of the legislation, I do not think it useful to try to give a detailed explanation of the legislation before its final drafting has been completed. Nor do I think that I should be trying to apply it to examples which honourable senators might raise because they have concerned constituents. The legislation in the broad is aimed at those situations in which people have sold companies on a basis which makes it clear that a current tax liability will not be met-in other words, where there is a situation in which the company has either an actual or a projected tax liability which, when taken into account, would ensure that the return on the sale of the shares was less than what was actually received. It would be most unusual in this place, I think, to try to respond in the manner that has been sought by Senator Chipp on a piece of legislation which has yet to be introduced, and I do not propose to take the answer any further than I have.

         —It is clear from recent statements by the Government that policies have recently been adopted by the Government to revitalise Australian shipping with the idea of planning commercial entry into overseas trades. Difficulties are currently being experienced in international shipping, as is acknowledged by Senator Lewis. However, that should not in any way affect the Government's outlook on the longer term questions of revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry. Even in the short term existing market conditions should not prevent Australian shipowners from taking advantage of commercial opportunities wherever and whenever they might arise on world markets. The industry knows that Government assistance will be available and the terms on which it will be given. It will, of course, have to look closely at all aspects of its costs and operations to ensure that it can compete.

       <para>
        The agreement reached in the industry task force on the Crawford report between shipowners and the maritime unions sets down the basis on which improved industrial and consultative arrangements and reduced manning can be achieved. Australian shipowners and maritime unions working together, therefore, for the advancement of the industry should be able to reach agreement on terms which will ensure the entry of some new Australian ships. However, we do take note of the point in Senator Lewis's question that in fact the industry is looking for only a modest increase of up to 12 ships over three years and, to be eligible for investment incentives, acceptable manning levels must be negotiated with the unions on the new vessels. The points implicit in Senator Lewis's question in connection with the future of Australian shipping, given the conditions that he outlined on the world markets in relation to the shipping industry, are clearly recognised and acknowledged by the Government and are built into the arrangements now outlined.

Wodehouse who dedicated his book to his wife and said: 'Without her valuable assistance this book would have been finished in half the time'. Let me remind Senator Button that, if he wants a factual answer, he should pay attention. If the Prime Minister was referring, as I think he was, to a shareholder who gained a capital increment through the sale of shares because the company tax was not paid, the Prime Minister has expressed the view-that would be a widely held view indeed-that a person being a member of such a company, particularly a proprietary company, could be expected to know that that company has a company debt as one of its debts and could be expected, therefore, to know that the value of the shares, including the capitalised value of the shares, would be greater because the company tax had not been paid. That would be, as I understand the quote from the Prime Minister's speech, a well accepted view in the community that a person would be expected to know that, in such a company, tax was due to be paid and that such a person had gained benefit from it. That being so, what the Prime Minister was saying is that the liability for the debt was there at the time, that in fact there was a liability at the time for company tax and that this is not retrospective application.

I can advise him that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommended, in its report on the Freedom of Information Bill, that a system for automatic declassification of national security documents should be instituted on an administrative basis. The Committee also made a number of other recommendations on classification. The Government's response to these recommendations was that they will be the subject of further study. That was advised to the Senate. It can be found in the Senate Hansard of 11 September 1980, at page 803.

        In response to a question from Senator Hamer on 19 November 1981 on this matter , Senator Durack indicated that the study had not been completed and that, as soon as he had time to do so, he proposed to have further discussions on the matter with officers of his Department. Since then there has been a new executive order issued by the President of the United States of America on the question of automatic declassification. The Senate Committee had the previous presidential order on this matter in mind when it made the recommendations. The question of automatic declassification is still under consideration. I will make further inquiries to find out what progress is being made, particularly in light of the changed situation in the United States.

        The instructions on the use of the national security classifications are contained in the protective security handbook. The handbook requires that those classifications be applied to national security information and to Cabinet documents. Instructions as to what constitutes Cabinet documents for this purpose are contained in the Cabinet handbook. I am not, of course, in a position to give an absolute assurance to the Senate that national security classifications are applied only in strict accordance with the national security handbook. The Government has made its intentions clear by the issue of that handbook. I will take the matter up with the Prime Minister to see whether any further instructions are thought to be needed.

         —It is true that a number of amalgamations are yet to be put into place among those which were indicated as being required by the Government in April 1981. That is some 18 months ago. The Government allowed 1981 and 1982 for the institutions involved to make appropriate arrangements. I am advised by the Victorian Government that agreement is likely between the Institute of Early Childhood Development and the State College of Victoria, Melbourne, for one amalgamation. I understand that some details are still to be worked out there. There are some points of disagreement which I hope will be overcome. In relation to Newcastle, I have been advised by the Vice-Chancellor of the University and also by the principal of the College of Advanced Education in that city that a number of talks have been held and that some heads of agreement have been considered but have not been finalised. Although there are still some points of disagreement there is likely to be some progress there. In relation to Armidale, I have been advised by the College of Advanced Education that it is willing, albeit reluctantly, to engage in amalgamation discussions. It is the University of New England which is refusing to progress the matter, the University, of course, considering itself free from any financial duress by the Government. In relation to the other two institutions, discussions are going on as regards the Milperra CAE and the Hawthorn State College as to appropriate arrangements which might be made or are possible. A number of proposals are being developed.

       <para>
        The Commonwealth laid down the end of 1982 as the time by which it required appropriate arrangements to be in place. In many cases these arrangements involve State legislation being passed. There are only two States-New South Wales and Victoria-in which amalgamations are yet to be put into place. In both of those States the parliamentary sittings may well be complete within the next 2 1/2 months. It is very important that those States have a capacity to introduce and to consider whatever legislation is necessary to give effect to the amalgamations which take place. The report of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission merely reiterated our concern and our determination on these matters that there should be appropriate arrangements. I hope to introduce the appropriate States grants legislation within the next week or two to provide funding. That legislation will contain some provisions to take account of those amalgamations which are in place already, those which are proposed and those which have not yet been proposed or suggested. It may be necessary to have within that legislation some provision to take account of those institutions which have not yet put forward suitable amalgamation proposals.

         —I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs indicated his concern recently at the number of illegal immigrants in Australia having either overstayed visas or having entered the country illegally. Can the Minister estimate the number of jobs which are unavailable to Australians due to the number of illegal immigrants in employment , and tell me how the Government plans to act to overcome this problem? Is it necessary to strengthen immigration legislation to ensure that there is no further abuse of the system or can the problem be solved by, for example, extra staffing in the Department to oversee illegal immigrants?

         — As I understand it, there is no need to have amending legislation to deal with the matter raised by Senator Kilgariff. I understand that consideration is being given by the Minister to providing further staff to enable the Department to look at those who are in this country as illegal immigrants and to take whatever steps are necessary in that connection. It has been estimated that about 50,000 people are in Australia illegally and that about 40,000 of these are working illegally to sustain themselves. There are about one million visitors to Australia each year and about 100,000 of these spend three months or more here. On the basis of detections made during investigations of illegal workers, it is assessed that as many as one in three work while they are in Australia. So, in response to the question, amendments are not necessary. However, I think further action by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs would be an effective control and would diminish as much as possible the number of illegal immigrants illegally working in this country.

         —My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and refers to the remarks he made at Bendigo at the weekend which were referred to earlier by Senator Button. Why did the Minister feel it necessary to reassure those who deprive consolidated revenue of many hundreds of millions of dollars of funds through tax avoidance schemes that they would not be subject to criminal prosecution? What different principle applies which allows him at the same time to have his Department continuing a policy of vigorous criminal prosecution of those who have been involved in depriving the revenue of much smaller sums? Many of these people are Aboriginals, single parents and unemployed people. Some of them, according to reports, have poor literacy and education and therefore may be ignorant of the law. Why is it necessary for the Minister to make this distinction between these two groups of people?

         —There is, of course, no such distinction drawn. As I indicated in response to an earlier question, the legislation which we passed in 1980 was unprecedented in imposing criminal penalties against certain tax offences. I have a copy of that Act in front of me. I notice in section 9 the penalty of imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years or a fine not exceeding $50, 000 or both on conviction for an offence under this Act.

        The particular remarks which were reported in the newspaper were part of a speech which covered a series of matters to a meeting of the Liberal Party. It dealt with the recent Budget. I mentioned the question of the proposed taxation legislation because, of course, that is a matter which has been very much in the public eye of late. I think my comment to that particular meeting was that I thought it would have been rather artificial and strange not to have at least devoted some remarks to it. I therefore gave a brief explanation of what was proposed. The reason for mentioning the question of criminal penalties was that it had come to my attention that there was some confusion in some sections of the public; people thought that what was proposed was the imposition of criminal penalties on vendor shareholders as against the recovery of taxes. In the course of my remarks I clarified that point.

        As far as the vigorous program for prosecution of offenders under the social security legislation is concerned, I think that is an unpardonable bit of political hyperbole on the part of the Opposition spokesman for social security because I think he knows that that does not truly represent the activities and actions of my Department. We have a significant task in trying to ensure that the very large social security system is not abused by the minority of people who set out to abuse it. A week or so ago in this place I was asked a question, as I recall it, about an allegation of one case of abuse involving, according to the newspapers, $100,000 in wrongly claimed unemployment benefit. The case involved an individual who was alleged to have used a series of false birth certificates to claim, from a series of offices of my Department, social security benefits to which he was not entitled. That sort of fraud is no more pardonable and no more acceptable than frauds upon the revenue, and I believe that we have to try to take an even-handed approach in these matters. We should certainly be as concerned by one area of abuse as another.

        Very often the substantial number of relatively small overpayments which are detected by my Department are caused by errors or omissions. Of course, the great bulk of them do not give rise to prosecution. Some of them give rise to recovery action; some do not. It is a feature of the work of the benefits control officers of my Department that a significant proportion of their work involves discovering underpayments to our clients and resultant increased payments to those people who are investigated. I cannot off the top of my head give the percentage figure, but I think that about 30 per cent of cases disclose underpayment rather than overpayment and consequently are for the benefit of those people about whom inquiry is made.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I think I mentioned in the Senate last week, there are two separate aspects of the work of the Department of Social Security. One is to ensure that all those people who are entitled to benefits receive them, and we conscientiously seek to do that. The more difficult part of our task is to try to ensure that those people who try to obtain benefits to which they are not entitled do not receive them. Of course, the dilemma is that we try to operate systems which are accessible to people in the community, many of whom are not the most able to use bureaucratic procedures, to fill in forms and so on. There is a very fine balance to be made between prevention of fraud and ensuring that people have a system which is manageable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say again to the Senate that we try to maintain a fair and reasonable balance in these matters. If Senator Grimes can bring forward examples of what he regards as improper prosecutions or in any sense victimisation of the clients of my Department, of course we will seek to follow them up and to root them out. I reject the criticism which he tries to make in the comparison which he has drawn . I simply remind him of the report of last week; the very substantial fraud in that case is a useful reminder of the difficult balance that we have to maintain .

         —I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his little lecture. I was trying to ascertain why the Minister took a different attitude in his speech in Bendigo from the approach of his Department. To clarify that, I ask: Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister, in his statement on Sunday 12 September, made it perfectly clear that he, and therefore I believe the Government, does not believe that anyone could have taken part in bottom-of- the-harbour schemes without knowing they were wrong? Therefore, these people knowingly deprived the revenue illegally of funds. Why is it necessary for the Minister to make this distinction between these people, who after all defrauded the revenue of much more than the people involved with the Department of Social Security? Why did he find it necessary to assure them that they would not be treated as criminals nor would they be subject to criminal charges when that does not apply to people who, according to many surveys, may have done similar things with the Department of Social Security out of ignorance or out of lack of understanding of the system?

         —I suppose it is to the political advantage of the Opposition to attempt to sow confusion in these matters but I now have before me the newspaper report on which the question was based. I say first of all that it is quite clear-this perhaps relates more to Senator Button's question-that my remarks as reported related to prospective legislation and not to the legislation which was passed in 1980. It says: 'We are not going to legislate to say'. In other words, it is referring to the legislation which is ahead. In any event, the full remarks that I made certainly were relevant to that. There is probably a fairly clear understanding in this place that what has been addressed by the Treasurer in his recent remarks are the claims that are to be made on those who are described as vendor shareholders, persons who have sold to individuals who have subsequently behaved in the manner proscribed by the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. A distinction is to be drawn between those who have actively stripped and rendered companies incapable of paying taxation and those who have sold shares to people who have then carried out those activities. The honourable senator, in asking his question, used the expression 'without knowing they were wrong'. I would say that we are in an area in which one is making judgments about right or wrong. There is no suggestion here of dealing in a field of straight illegality. Hence one is making judgments about right and wrong. In these circumstances the Government has indicated that it proposes to legislate to recover the taxation due, even though that is an unusual procedure.

Does the Minister agree that automation is basically beneficial to the community but that, if it is to gain acceptance, some sharing of the benefits thereof must go to the community and workers, otherwise a neo-Luddite community attitude is inevitable?

I have seen reports of the profits of the banks over the last year and my recollection is that, in the main, they were at a very healthy level . I have heard reports of the union request that they should move to a nine-day working fortnight. I make the general comment that the move to the working of shorter hours for the same rate of pay is one that has not been generally welcomed by the Government, given Australia's current economic circumstances. I am relieved to see Senator Mason nodding his head. I do not know whether that means that he has heard me or that he agrees with me. Certainly in general the Government would take the view that to increase the unit cost of labour is not helpful to Australia, with its current international competitiveness and so on. Whilst different considerations might arise in the banking industry, I would be fairly cautious in embracing the proposition that reductions in working hours will be helpful to Australia economically in 1982. I will refer the broader aspects of the question to Mr Macphee for his consideration. He may choose to give a reply after more consideration has been given to the points raised by the honourable senator.

        With respect to the availability of assistance, I remind the Senate that, even had that legislation been passed, it was always provided that there should be access to payment where no other means were available. In other words, it was certainly not the Government's wish, even in a strike situation, to deny unemployment benefit where no other money was available for the sustenance of wives and children. There is certainly no policy reason on the part of the Government why this should occur. If it has occurred it would appear to be a clear case of error. I shall follow it up and let the honourable senator have a report on it as soon as possible.

         —I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is it a fact that there is a three-year backlog in the processing of tax avoidance and evasion cases by the Taxation Office in Hobart and that there is an estimate of tens of millions of dollars uncollected in Tasmania alone? I understand that the Government decided to appoint more staff but that nothing has yet been done to commence recruitment, let alone training. When will more staff be appointed to the Hobart tax office? How many will there be? Will the extra numbers all be allocated to the task of catching up with the tax evasion backlog? Will the Government acknowledge that the fact of these proposed appointments is an admission that its too restrictive staff ceilings have exacerbated the Taxation Office's difficulties in dealing with tax evasion? How much difference will the extra staff make in dealing with the problem?

         —I am pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition saying 'hear, hear', and indeed I can be positive in responding to the question and say that it is a matter of satisfaction to the Government that the New South Wales Government, on this occasion, seems more anxious to take firm action in this dispute. I think that that is a response to the very deep public concern that exists about what has been far too frequently a sore on the body of industrial relations in New South Wales, and something which has been very deeply felt by many of the citizens of New South Wales because of the great inconvenience to which they have been subjected. The Federal Government joins the New South Wales Government in saying that all bans should be lifted and that the union should allow both State and Federal tribunals to proceed with the matters before them. As far as the particular workers are concerned, it is, of course, a feature of this dispute-I have noticed some public comment on it-that we are not dealing with workers who would be regarded as low-paid. The figures I have show that an operator on appointment receives a base rate of $323.40 a week. Whilst specific figures are not available, it is estimated that if such an operator adhered to the normal shift roster premiums and allowances would increase the base rate to an estimated average of $450 a week. An operator with five years service would receive an estimated average wage of $475 for working the normal shift cycle.

        I suppose it is unfortunately true that once a person has been receiving that salary-which is certainly well above average weekly earnings and would be regarded by most Australians as very good remuneration-for a while it does not seem so much. I can understand that those workers would, in common with almost every other section of the Australian community, feel that they are underpaid and deserving of greater remuneration. That really highlights the importance of the people concerned seeing their position in light of the position of many of their fellow Australians, who are not nearly as well off, and being prepared to moderate their claims accordingly. I think all honourable senators would agree that the disputes which have afflicted this part of New South Wales industry are really something of a disgrace. We would all want the people concerned to return to work and use arbitration, and not the strike weapon-at great inconvenience to their fellow citizens.

I have already indicated to my colleague-I give the same indication to Senator Gietzelt-that I will ask the Minister whom I represent in this place to look again at whether more needs to be done in relation to ultraviolet light and the use of ultraviolet lamps. I indicated in that answer that on previous occasions the question of commercial solaria has been raised in the Senate and concern has been expressed, I know, by some honourable senators who themselves have had some experience of skin conditions. I believe they received professional advice that ultraviolet light may have contributed. The question of commercial solaria is important, especially as they might or might not conform to standards which have been laid down.

         — Senator Keeffe asked again a question which he had referred to me in August with regard to the domestic surplus on the last day of June 1982. I have the response from the Treasury which shows that Senator Keeffe is incorrect in suggesting that there was a political manipulation of the domestic surplus on the last day of the last financial year . The event to which he may be referring is the coincidence of the last day in the financial year 1981-82 with the normal schedule of payment of salaries of Commonwealth Public Service employees and pensions. The due date for these payments was Thursday, 1 July 1982, and an amount estimated at $430m was withdrawn on 30 June according to normal payment practices. About $180m of this $430m was credited automatically to the bank accounts of the recipients on 30 June. The remaining sum was held for distribution as cash or cheques on 1 July. Some cheques for employees in remote areas were mailed as early as the previous Friday, 25 June. The funds were not invested between their withdrawal and their use on 1 July 1982. In accordance with normal practice, these payments were all recorded in the Government's accounts on 30 June 1982 and were included in the financial year 1981-82. Therefore, there was no manipulation, political or otherwise, of the domestic surplus. The reason for drawing attention to these transactions in the Budget Papers was their delayed impact on measured money supply M3. This is explained in an attachment which the Treasury has sent to me . I seek leave to have that attachment incorporated in Hansard for Senator Keeffe's information.

        PAYDAY EFFECT

       <para>
        Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1981-82 included a Public Service and Social Security benefit payment on Wednesday, 30 June 1982, estimated at $430 million. The due date for this payment was Thursday, 1 July-the first day of the 1982-83 financial year. However, many payees have their payments automatically transferred to a bank account and these transactions-estimated at $180 million in total-took place on Wednesday, 30 June.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. That part of the $430 million not automatically transferred to bank accounts-about $250 million-had no effect on measured money supply M3 in 1981- 82; the full impact occurred in July 1982. The other $180 million was recorded in bank deposits in 1981-82. But the full effect of this increase did not feed through into measured M3, which includes the increase in trading bank deposits on an average-of-Wednesdays rather than an end-of-month basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. As a result, the payday on 30 June is estimated to have increased M3 by about $70 million in 1981-82, or by about 0.1 per cent of the June 1981 stock of M3; and by about $360 million in 1982-83, or by about 0.6 per cent of the stock of M3 in June 1982.

I think I should draw Senator Robertson 's attention to the point that I made a small mistake in the original answer to the question. I indicated that the station had already been leased. This answer represents a correction of that point. On the question of reprinting existing publications, these are considered to be part of the assets of the station and will be a matter for negotiation between the Government and the successful proposer. I can assure the honourable senator that Experimental Building Station publications, which are in great demand, will continue to be made available.

        The purpose of this Bill is to enable appointments to be made of Special Prosecutors with clear authority and independence to institute in exceptional cases and carry on necessary prosecutions. These cases will be of such a special character that the community should not be left in the slightest doubt that prosecutions will be handled with the highest professional competence with complete independence from any extraneous consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first appointment of a Special Prosecutor will be of a person to assume overall responsibility for the handling of the prosecutions for the alleged taxation frauds referred to as bottom of the harbour schemes and for co- ordinating the recovery by civil remedies under existing law of the amounts thereby lost to the Commonwealth. This legislation is therefore a clear indication of the Government's intention to proceed with the utmost vigour in these cases regardless of all considerations other than the proper enforcement of the law and the protection of the revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principal task of a Special Prosecutor will be in relation to breaches of laws of the Commonwealth or a Territory but he will be able to conduct prosecutions for offences against the laws of a State where he receives an appropriate appointment by or under the law of the relevant State.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is determined that the Special Prosecutor is backed and supported by all necessary staff including lawyers, accountants and investigating staff and special provision is made in clauses 17, 18 and 19 to ensure this result. The accountability of a Special Prosecutor is ensured by the requirement for annual reports of his operations. His independence is assured by the provisions of clause 7 limiting any direction or guidelines to directions or guidelines of a general character not relating to a particular case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Special prosecutors appointed under the legislation will play an important role in the administration of criminal justice under Commonwealth law within the limits that will be imposed on them by the Attorney-General's delineation of their functions.

        Part VI of the Bill inserts in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 a definition of 'The Department'. It is hoped that this general definition will overcome to a large extent the need to separately define the word in particular legislation. Having regard to this amendment, the opportunity has been taken, in regard to the formal machinery of government amendments contained in Schedule 12 to the Bill, to rely as much as possible on that general definition.

        Honourable Senators will recall the commitment I made to the Parliament in a statement concerning Parliamentary disallowance of delegated legislation on 26 May 1981 in relation to certain Reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Reglations and Ordinances. I then said that a careful study would be made of existing disallowance provisions with a view to also bringing those into line with the Government's policy that future disallowance provisions should, unless there is good reason to the contrary, incorporate the substance of the principles contained in sections 48, 49 and 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
       </para>
       <para>
        That study is now well underway and the amendments to the undermentioned Act brings those Acts into conformity with those sections of the Acts Interpretation Act to the extent practicable in the particular case:

Part VII of the Bill amends section 62B of the Audit Act so as to provide wider avenues of investment of such moneys. The amendments will permit investment in securities issued by government authorities, on loans to authorised dealers in the official money market, in certificates of deposit and in clean bills of exchange. Also the Minister for Finance will be empowered to approve other suitable forms of investment.

        Part XI of the Bill makes a number of amendments to improve the operation of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 26A of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 provides that former Narcotics Enforcement Branch staff may, if qualified and suitable, be appointed to the Australian Federal Police. Arising from recent legal advice the Government has become aware that persons so appointed might not, by reason of the legal preference contained in section 73 of the Act, have equal rights to promotion and transfer within the Australian Federal Police as former officers of the former Commonwealth Police Force and the Police Force of the Australian Capital Territory. The Bill makes the necessary amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act to ensure that equality.

        Banking Act 1959
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Part XII of the Bill adds a new Part IIA to the Banking Act 1959 to facilitate the operation of State and Northern Territory legislation relating to the merging of the banking businesses, respectively, of the Bank of New South Wales and the Commercial Bank of Australia Limited, and of The National Bank of Australasia Limited and The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation now passed (or in course of passage) in each of the States and the Northern Territory will assist the merging banks and their many customers by removing the administrative burden that would otherwise be involved in completing the merger of the banks' businesses in those jurisdictions. Within the Australian Capital Territory Ordinances will shortly be made to facilitate the merger of the banks' businesses in the Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments made to the Banking Act by Part XII of the Bill will remove a range of uncertainties arising from potential inconsistences between various areas of Commonwealth legislation and the abovementioned State and Territory legislation. The amendments made by the Bill to the Banking Act will avoid the possibility that, by reason of any such inconsistency, some portion of the relevant State or Northern Territory legislation might be held to be invalid. In addition, the amendments to the Banking Act provide for the States and Northern Territory legislation to bind the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision is also made by the Bill for the amendments I have outlined to be applied, at the discretion of the Treasurer in the event of any future bank merger being implemented by the same method as has been adopted for these mergers. No such merger is, of course, contemplated at this time, and I remind honourable senators that in granting his consent under section 63 of the Banking Act to the present mergers the Treasurer pointed out that it should not be assumed that consent would necessarily be forthcoming in respect of any future merger proposals. Nevertheless, in the event at some future time of a merger being duly considered and accepted, this provision would obviate the need for further Commonwealth legislative action to ensure that no constitutional difficulties arises from the enactment of State and Territory facilitating legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should point out that the amendments of the Banking Act made by the Bill will not have the effect of altering the substantive rights and obligations which presently exist between the continuing banks and their customers. It simply ensures that the business of the merged banks is able to be transferred to the continuing banks with minimum disruption to the service provided by the banks.

        The amendment made by Part XVI of the Bill allows licenced premises to be used as polling booths provided the Chief Australian Electoral Officer is satisfied that no intoxicating liquor is available for sale on those premises whilst they are being so used.

       <para>
        The Bill provides for two categories of amendment of the Companies Act 1981. The amendments have been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first category, which involves amendments to sections 509 and 517 of the Principal Act, is designed to ensure that there is greater consistency in the obligations imposed on different types of corporations as to the amount of information which they must disclose on documents such as cheques. This consistency is to be achieved by a reduction in the amount of information required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pursuant to the amendments made by the Bill, it will no longer be necessary for any corporation to indicate on bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques or other negotiable instruments any details as to the State or Territory in which it is incorporated, registered as a foreign company, or formed, as the case may be. It is mentioned that under the Companies Act 1981 as it presently operates, an officer of such a corporation who signs such a document in the A.C.T. could be liable to the holder of the document if he does not indicate the requisite details.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments will also relieve any corporation, which has limited liability but does not have the words 'Limited' in its name, of the need to indicate in those same documents that it has limited liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both types of information covered by the abovementioned amendments will still be required in any business letter, statement of account, invoice, order for goods, order for services, receipt, official notice or publication of a company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second category of amendment to the Principal Act involves amendments to sections 5 and 581. Those amendments are designed to preserve the operation of the provisions of three A.C.T. Ordinances which are dependant on the relevant companies legislation in force in the A.C.T. at any particular time.

        The amendment made by Part XXI of the Bill allows a Deputy President whose present appointment to office ran until he attains the age of seventy years to be appointed as President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission without any diminution of the right to serve until he attains the age of seventy years. The amendment ensures that if such a person is appointed as President he is not required to retire at the age of sixty-five years which would otherwise be the case with all new appointments to presidential office in the Commission.

        At present, assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 cannot be given to an eligible person if he or his spouse owns another home. One effect of this provision is to exclude from assistance a person who does not own a home and who is permanently separated, but not divorced, from his spouse if that spouse owns a home. The proposed amendments will enable an advance to be made in such circumstances notwithstanding the separated spouse's ownership of a home.

       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Part XXXVI of the Bill amends sub-section 66 (5) of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to overcome a practical problem which has become evident in the light of experience with the preparation of zoning plans for newly declared areas of the Marine Park.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sub-section 66 (5) of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act provides that regulations shall not apply to an area within the Marine Park in respect of which no zoning plan is in force if more than 12 months has elapsed since that area became part of the Marine Park. Experience has shown that, because of the timing requirements in the Principal Act relating to the preparation of zoning plans, the period of 12 months has proved to be insufficient. The amendment to sub-section 66 (5) made by the Bill will allow regulations to apply to such areas for a period of up to 2 years from the date an area becomes part of the Marine Park. The amendment will avoid interim regulations lapsing before a zoning plan comes into effect.

        Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments made by Part XLIV of the Bill seek to overcome certain technical deficiencies in the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976. They will ensure that the Government's longstanding policy intentions, in respect of the provision of encouragement by way of commencement grant to companies to commence systematic research and development activities, are given full effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Act was intended to provide that entitlements of any company to commencement grants be restricted to five consecutive years, with this entitlement reduced by one year for each grant received under the preceding grants scheme. This policy was announced when the Act was first introduced in the Parliament in 1976. It has been very well publicised since.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, amendments made to the Act in 1981 did not adequately secure this policy of limited entitlement. The proposed amendments to sections 25 and 26A will overcome these deficiencies. The much simplified section 25 will establish the term of available assistance. Amended section 26A will prevent circumvention of the intent of section 25 by ensuring that the device of corporate restructuring is not available to beneficiaries as a means of securing additional assistance under the commencement grant provisions or the preceding grants scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments made by Part XLIV of the Bill also relate to the cut-off date for lodging of applications for commencement grants. Previously similar provision had been made for the purpose by regulation but recent legal advice has expressed doubt about the validity of that regulation. The provision now to be made in the Act will provide for a cut-off date of 30 September next after the end of the grant year. Also there will no longer be a discretion to extend that date. The amendments will provide an automatic extension for lodging an application to 30 November next in each grant year provided the company concerned had notified, before 30 September, that it will be unable to meet that cut-off date. Where an application covered by that automatic extension to 30 November is received, the amendments made by the Bill will provide for deferral of payment of a commencement grant to the next financial year.

        The main feature of the amendments made by Part XLVIII of the Bill to the Navigation Act 1912 is to provide that regulations made pursuant to various sections of the Act may empower the Minister to make orders in respect of matters able to be prescribed by the regulations made under those sections.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also inserts a new section 295B in the Navigation Act to give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Victoria to exempt historic shipwrecks and relics within the waters of that State from the provisions of the Act governing the salvage and disposal of wrecks. The amendments made by clauses 176 and 177 gives to historic shipwrecks and historic relics within the meaning of a law of a State or of the Northern Territory relating to such shipwrecks or relics the same exemption as have Commonwealth historic wrecks from certain provisions of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two further amendments made by the Bill will provide procedural improvements in the administration of the Act. A ship survey authority will be able to be approved by Ministerial instrument rather than by the regulations. Furthermore, dangerous goods now to be identified for the purpose of the carriage provisions of the Act, by express reference to the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, which is an extensive and frequently amended publication of the International Maritime Organization.

        Under the original provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, laws in force in the relevant States and Territories, including Commonwealth Acts, are applied to activities connected with petroleum exploration and exploitation activities in the offshore 'adjacent area' of the State or Territory in question as defined in the Schedules to that Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the entry into force of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980 , however, such Commonwealth Acts will cease to apply automatically in adjacent areas. The scope of the application of Commonwealth Act will then be a matter to be provided for specifically in the particular Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) operates services to oil exploration and drilling platforms or structures on the continental shelf. Without the amendments made by Part LII of the Bill, to the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946, the validity of the services provided by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) in adjacent area would be in doubt when the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980 comes into force.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments therefore apply the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946 in the offshore ''adjacent area'' when the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act comes into force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similar amendments are also required to the Postal Services Act 1975 in respect of services provided by the Australian Postal Commission and to the Telecommunications Act 1975, in respect of services provided by the Australian Telecommunications Commission. The necessary amendments are made by Parts LVII and LXXIII respectively of the Bill.

        The Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 provides for the formation of Sectional Committees of three or more members and that the provisions applying in relation to the Committee, with some exceptions, apply to the Sectional Committees. Since the 1979 amendments to the Act difficulties have arisen in application of the quorum provision to those Sectional Committees which have only a small number of members. The amendments made by the Bill to Section 9 of the Act specify the quorum of a Sectional Committee depending on the number of members of the Committee.

       <para>
        This Bill is intended to ensure that the Australian Omega navigation facility can be operated free from unnecessary interruption.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Omega station completes a world-wide network of eight stations. The other seven stations are operated by Argentina, Japan, Liberia, Norway, France (at La Reunion), and the United States of America (at Hawaii and North Dakota). The Omega system is a long-range radio navigation system for use by aircraft, ships and land vehicles to determine their position in virtually any part of the world and in any weather. Each station transmits omnidirectional signals in the very low frequency radio band. In the usual mode of operation, a receiver needs to detect signals from at least three Omega stations to determine a position-fix. Omega receivers of varying complexity are available from commercial sources throughout the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Governments of Australia and the United States of America entered into an exchange of notes in 1977, agreeing to the establishment and operation of the Australian station. The agreement has been previously tabled and is reproduced in the Schedule to the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The agreement provides that Australia is to be solely responsible for operating , managing, staffing and maintaining the facility and that each Government is required to ensure the continuous operation of its respective facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian facility comprises a transmitter and associated equipment located on Commonwealth land near Darriman in Victoria, and monitoring equipment located on Commonwealth land near Carrajung, also in Victoria. The facility commenced transmitting on a fully operational basis on 16 August and is to be officially opened in October, this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Being an integral part of the world-wide Omega system, it is essential that the Government take all necessary steps to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the Australian facility. The Government believes this Bill to be an appropriate measure to deal with any threat of irresponsible action to interfere with transmissions by the Australian facility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Bill, where circumstances necessitate, persons who ordinarily supply goods or services required for use in connection with the Omega facility may be directed by the Minister to supply such goods or services. Obstruction of the supply of goods or services, and refusal to carry out a direction of the Minister are defined in the Bill as offences. The Bill also ensures access to the facility by persons whose access is sufficiently important to warrant protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the objects of the Bill is to secure State co-operation in the continued operation and maintenance of the Omega facility. State laws consistent with that object are preserved. However, State laws that conflict with the purposes of the Bill are set aside.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill operates concurrently with other laws, particularly those relating to protection of property and the safety of navigation aids. In addition it contains a provision to ensure that the prosecution of offences in relation to Omega can be undertaken by the Commonwealth without having to rely on State action.
       </para>
       <para>
        If a person suffers loss or damage or property is acquired from him as a result of the operation of the Bill, he is entitled to compensation from the Commonwealth on just terms.

        In conclusion, the Government's objective is to provide effective navigational aids for the safety of ships and aircraft operating in and around Australia, particularly those engaged in our coastal and overseas trades. The establishment of the Omega facility is a significant step towards the achievement of that objective, and the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the operation of the facility is not disrupted.

        —by leave-There has been some uncertainty about what the status would now be of my notice of motion, Order of the Day No. 168, relating to the tabling of papers arising out of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, it being foreshadowed last week that efforts would be made to bring this matter on for debate today. Let me simply say that in all the very regrettable circumstances associated with the illness of the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, it is certainly the view of honourable senators on this side of the chamber that it would be inappropriate to pursue that matter today, at least until the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, who is to act for Senator Durack in this chamber, has an opportunity to get on top of the undoubtedly numerous issues of complexity that will be needed to be debated in relation to this report. The Opposition has no desire to unnecessarily or unfairly embarrass Senator Chaney or anyone on the Government side in that respect.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Following some discussions on this subject with Senator Chaney-no doubt he will wish to add something in this respect on his own behalf-we have come to some tentative agreement as to the most appropriate way overall in which this potentially very sensitive and complex matter might be handled. It is my understanding that the Government proposes to table if not all then certainly most of the documents requested in some form or other and that the Government proposes to bring down a compendious statement in association with those papers, explaining why it is that some papers will be allowed to get into the public domain and why others are, in the view of the Government, inappropriate to get into the public domain. Given that statement of the Government's intention made to me by Senator Chaney, it does seem to me and to others on this side of the chamber with whom I have had an opportunity so far to discuss this matter that it would probably be a rather sterile debate to pursue the motion in its original form until we find out precisely what the Government's intention is. It would seem appropriate to defer what will still undoubtedly be a fairly vigorous debate as to what ought to be in and what ought to be out until we know what the Government's intentions are.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, let me qualify that in two respects. In the first place, we do not wish to be taken as acceding to the Government's apparent intention not to seek any objective non-Government advice as to whether particular matters may or may not prejudice prosecutions. We do not resile from our desire to ensure that that test is applied by someone with no axe to grind, someone who has an objective view on that question. It remains to be seen whether the documents that come forward from the Government and the procedures that are applied by the Government in bringing those documents forward will satisfy us in that respect. The second qualification concerns time. I understand from Senator Chaney that it is the Government's intention to make a statement and to table the papers-to the extent that it is willing to do so-either at the end of this week or, at the latest, early next week. It is understandable from our point of view that there should be that degree of delay, given the complexity of the matter. We are not disposed to create any further difficulties for the Government in that respect. I simply put on notice to the Government-I hope that in this respect I speak for others on this side of the chamber who no doubt can speak for themselves, as they usually do-that should there be any question or suggestion of unreasonable stalling by the Government on this matter the Government can expect us to be somewhat less reasonably inclined than we are at the moment in all the circumstances as they presently exist. I hope that that clarifies the matter in terms of what the most appropriate procedures might be.

        —by leave-I want to make it perfectly clear, having regard to the fact that I made the first suggestion that there should be some person equipped to engage in the filtering process of the documents in relation to the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union so as to ensure that material contained in them which could possibly prejudice successful prosecutions was excised, that I will be pursuing the matter at the appropriate time. I foreshadowed when this matter was debated previously that I would move that the Royal Commissioner in conjunction with the Crown Solicitor could be an appropriate way of performing that filtering function given that everybody now recognises the importance of ensuring that the documents should not contain information which is prejudical to a successful prosecution in certain circumstances.

      <para>
       Having made that point I say right here and now what I have said to other people. I, of course, voted against the original motion demanding the resignation of Mr Howard and Senator Durack because it seemed to me that the cart was being put before the horse. Yet people were prepared to vote for the resignations of Senator Durack and Mr Howard without having seen the documentary evidence which they are now seeking. Of course, it is another question of whether or not that documentary evidence when tabled in Parliament will provide the evidence on which they retrospectively sought to get the heads of Senator Durack and Mr Howard. I will be interested to see what the documents contain. However, I agree that the documents should not contain information which would be prejudicial to a fair prosecution.

      <para>
       I feel I must say that if Senator Chaney is not prepared or is not able to proceed-I grant what Senator Evans has said that time should be made available for that-I see no reason why we should not press ahead with that part of Senator Evans's motion which relates to documents which are under the control of the Treasurer. I understand the other aspect and I am sympathetic to it. However, the Treasurer is back on deck and in fighting form at present. I see no reason why we should not press on in respect of those documents which are under his control.

        —by leave-I, of course, regret that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is not able to speak in continuance of the remarks he made last Thursday. I acknowledge the gesture on behalf of the Opposition to stand the matter over out of consideration for that fact. I can say, however, that the attitude which is being adopted by the Government today does not hinge on the absence of Senator Durack. It was a matter that he attended to prior to his becoming ill last night. It was a matter on which the Government had determined a response and I just want to indicate to the Senate what that response its.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Had Senator Durack been here he would have been, as I am now, suggesting that in any event we needed some little time to meet the requirements of the motion. The Government wishes, to the fullest extent possible, to meet the request which is foreshadowed in the motion which has been given. It is not able today to respond in as definite a way as it would like as to the precise timing. Senator Evans indicated in his remarks that he thought perhaps this should be perhaps by the end of the week or early next week and it certainly would be my wish to meet one of those.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think I should report to the Senate that this morning I discussed with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) this question of timing. On behalf of the Government he is anxious to get the papers tabled as soon as possible. He was not able to give a commitment to the end of this week. I think that was an inability born of caution because work has to be done to ensure that the documents are tabled in a form which will not be either in breach of the provisions of the income tax law or in any way prejudicial to the actions which the Government could and should take with respect to any offences which might be disclosed or tax recovery action which ought to be taken. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Attorney-General have already indicated in their respective chambers that the documents requested in relation to this matter will be examined against the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. That examination is not being undertaken with a view to limiting access that is to be given and it is not being taken in a way which is an attempt to restrict to the strict requirements of that Act, which is yet to come into operation in any event, what might be tabled by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Attorney-General also announced that he has asked the Solicitor-General for advice on whether the publication of legal opinions sought would prejudice criminal or civil proceedings that might be brought. I should like just to foreshadow to the Senate, so that honourable senators have time to think about it and no doubt to prepare some response to it, that the area of most concern in what is to be put on the table lies with legal opinions. The view has been put to the Government that there could be prejudice in the tabling of a number of them. I indicate that that is likely to be the area on which there will be some discussion between us.

        —The fact is that the Government has sought and obtained some advice and I am simply giving some prior indication that that is likely to be the area in which there will be some further discussion, both Senator Evans and Senator Harradine having expressed interest in the tests that might be applied to determine what is to be excluded and what is not. The work to get the documents into order is still proceeding. I would like to assure the Senate, as Senator Durack did last week, that the Government is taking the present motion very seriously. A great deal of work has been done in collecting and examining relevant material. There has been the most serious and earnest spirit of endeavour in order to meet the major questions raised by the motion. The exercise has to be carried out carefully having regard to the secrecy provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and other requirements of confidentiality. But it is my understanding that the Treasurer will be tabling a substantial number of documents and any exceptions made in the case of documents referred to in the motion will be explained.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As far as timing is concerned, I repeat that it is the Government's wish that that should take place as soon as possible. I have already informally indicated to Senator Evans that I will check again with the Treasurer tomorrow as to what progress is being made and discuss it with him. Of course, I am happy to extend that to other elements of the Senate which may be concerned with this motion-the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine. I will check with the Treasurer what the likely timetable appears to be tomorrow. But I make all those comments from the background that it is the Government's view that it wishes to make disclosure which will remove public and Senate concern about the issues which have been raised. We will table the documents as soon as possible and I will indicate to interested senators as early as possible what time table the Government believes it can meet. I think it would be counter-productive when dealing with this matter, however, to give an estimate of time which I then could not meet. I would prefer to avoid any possible misunderstandings and allegations which can occur in those circumstances. No doubt the matter will be raised again in the Senate, if not later this week. In the meantime there can be informal discussions between interested senators and me.

        I do not intend to debate the motion at length but perhaps an explanation is necessary. Honourable senators will recall that last Thursday no debate on papers which had been presented took place. Due to the sessional orders papers were not presented in the morning. The Senate decided that other matters were more urgent at that time. The Estimates committees which came on later in the day occupied the remainder of the period when papers would have been considered. It is important that we consider papers when they are presented in this place. That fact has been borne out by the number of honourable senators who have indicated interest in the papers that would have been discussed on Thursday. This motion is moved in order to accommodate their wishes in that regard. It will allow for one hour of debate, from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should explain that the motion calls for papers to be considered pursuant to the sessional orders relating thereto. That simply means that the debate will be limited to a maximum of 10 minutes for each honourable senator who wishes to speak to a paper. Also, of course, the opportunity to speak on the matter again will present itself when the papers come before the Senate once more. A certain quid pro quo is involved, in that a motion on a matter of public importance is not to be presented today. The Opposition is asking that one hour of the time that would have been taken up in discussing such a motion should be made available. I commend the motion to the Senate.

Debate did not occur last Thursday on the various papers laid on the table because the Opposition sought to raise, as a matter of urgency, the Costigan report and related matters . In that situation the reduction in the time available for discussion of the various papers clearly occurred at the motivation of the Opposition. Consequently, this being a Government Business day, and normally recognised as such, the Government holds the view that we should proceed with Government Business and not change the order of business in such a way as to permit private senators' business to intervene.

         — The Australian Democrats support the motion , partly for the reasons expressed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Senator Messner) and partly for those expressed by Senator Robertson. Normally on Thursdays we do not have before us a matter of public importance or, as happened last Thursday, an urgency motion. That is the normally accepted context . The fact that it was departed from meant that the papers could not be discussed or raised. We believe that since today the Opposition has not sought to raise a matter of public importance, papers of concern to honourable senators might very well be discussed, thus righting the situation that got out of kilter last Thursday. However, we believe that in future it would be preferable to follow on Thursday the settled convention of not presenting motions of urgency or motions concerning matters of public importance, but rather pursuing the normal course of events and discussing papers at that time. Since the Australian Labor Party has not sought today to present a matter of public importance we believe it proper to support the motion. In that way honourable senators who wish to debate papers may have the opportunity of which they were deprived last Thursday.

         —The Customs and Excise Amendment Bill is an important Bill. Its prime objective is to provide a long overdue increase in penalties for Customs offences. The Opposition does not oppose it. We take the view, as we have always done, that Customs offences must be treated seriously, as of course Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore found out even before this increase in penalties. For all the familiar reasons, especially deterrents and protection of revenue, we believe that penalties must bear a reasonable relationship to the nature of the offence.

       <para>
        Before dealing with the Bill, it is appropriate to advert to a matter which is much more immediately relevant to the effectiveness of Customs and excise legislation than the level of penalties, that is, the effectiveness and efficiency of Customs administration. In this respect one must now refer to the statement last Sunday, 12 September, of the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Fife. He indicated that the Government was about to set in train a major restructing of the Bureau of Customs in each State and the renaming of the Bureau as the Australian Customs Service. It appears that what is being contemplated is, in the language of Mr Fife, the most comprehensive exercise undertaken in Customs since federation. It is also said by Mr Fife that it represents the product of consultations over a considerable period, particularly the last 18 months.

       <para>
        Four areas of change are set out-firstly, a strengthened organisation and strengthened operational procedures to upgrade further Customs controls; secondly, the formation of a single Customs officer career stream with the amalgamation of the two existing divisional groups; thirdly, extensive and comprehensive retraining programs for existing staff; and, finally, a completely revised recruitment and a 12 months full time training program for future Customs officers. Unfortunately, the general description of what is intended is not accompanied by any documentation or other descriptive material which would enable one to assess with any degree of confidence just what in fact is being proposed. There is an extraordinary degree of generality about the language of Mr Fife's one and a half page release not only in respect of the four general areas covered, which I have just recounted, but also in the other descriptions. For example, Mr Fife said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The application of controls to implement Government policies for community and industry protection and revenue collection will be supported by the introduction of improved risk assessment techniques, upgraded training programs and a more dynamic approach to the deployment of staff in all areas of Customs activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each one of those descriptions could mean absolutely anything and, until we get some supplementary further and better particulars, it is difficult to comment or respond sensibly on what is proposed. Similarly, Mr Fife makes this further statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        The effectiveness of the existing staff would be maximised with the introduction of widened and more responsible duties for officers and more flexible working arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again one is left with a sense of mystery about what in fact is being proposed. We need more detail and I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in his response to tell the Senate whether and when a full report will be made available with details as to the general matters to which I have already referred and also the 'complete review of more than 3,800 positions', together with the timetable for the proposed implementation procedures to take effect. It is all very well for the Minister to be 'confident that the new Australian Customs Service will result in improved standards of service in the vital spheres of community and industry protection'. If he wants us to believe him, he will have to tell us a bit more than what is contained in this rather derisory Press statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say all this on behalf of the Opposition because of our well known concern, articulated on numerous occasions particularly in the aftermath of the MacKellar -Moore affair, that there is a degree of unhappiness in the way the present service operates. There have been numerous allegations of inefficiency and worse from a variety of sources in regard to the way in which the Bureau operates. I understand that there is still in train, although it is hardly referred to in Mr Fife's statement, a detailed review by Mr Frank Mahony of the operation of the present Bureau of Customs in New South Wales. The likely outcome of that review is not something which is referred to, let alone apparently accommodated, in the present proposal. On several occasions following the MacKellar-Moore affair we have called for a full judiciary inquiry and we will go on indicating our lack of happiness with the way the Bureau and the Customs service has operated until we get, as I said before, some further and better particulars. That is not to say that we want to be taken as being in any way critical of the matters set out in this release because it may well be, particularly if the language is matched by the reality, that we do have here the prospect of some very significant changes. But there are problems and they will not simply go away by the use of fine words and one and a half page Press releases. We need some more details.
       </para>
       <para>
        One further point that ought to be made in this respect to press home the nature of our concern is the circumstance reported in the Press last week that Mr Tony Mayhew, the Customs officer at the centre of the MacKellar-Moore colour television affair, is to retire early because of ill health. Mr Mayhew was the officer who intervened at Sydney Airport in October 1981 when he saw the Minister in question carrying the unit and who set in train the subsequent course of events. He was the officer subsequently accused within the Bureau of a variety of irrational, emotional and agitated behaviour. It has been claimed on Mr Mayhew's behalf by Mr Bennett, the President of the New South Wales branch of the Customs Officers Association of Australia, that Mr Mayhew simply would not have retired early-or at least the numbers of years early that he is retiring- except for the pressure he came under during and after the colour television affair. I am well aware that this is the sort of matter presumably being dealt with by the Mahoney review but it does indicate that there are attentions, doubts and concerns about the operation of the present Bureau in a variety of jurisdictions. We remain unconvinced that really serious endeavours are being made to resolve that situation. We will be sceptical until we see the words matched by action.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to the Bill before the Senate. It is essentially a machinery measure which amends the Customs Act primarily by substantially raising the level of penalties for breaches of the Act, excluding narcotics related offences which were the subject of legislation in 1979 following the report of the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. The structure and the detail of the offences in the Customs legislation and the penalty and prosecution provisions of the existing Act have undergone only very limited change since 1901. There is no question but that very substantial review and revision on all fronts was called for.
       </para>
       <para>
        The inadequacy of current penalties is highlighted by a number of considerations. For example, penalties for narcotics offences are now dramatically higher than those for other prohibited imports and exports. That may be appropriate in some circumstances but not necessarily in all. Again, most non-narcotic offence penalties have not been varied since 1967. A typical maximum fine is only $1,000. For some offences it is only $50. Again, the horse and kangaroo meat scandal recently revealed that penalties were quite inadequate in relation to the multi-million dollar benefits that evasion of Customs duty can bring when well organised frauds are in issue. There are other examples of that kind which have been canvassed in the other place, and I do not stop to go over them in too much laborious detail now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed penalties include the following: Where revenue is evaded, the penalty is to be at least twice and up to five times the amount evaded. Where prohibited exports or imports are involved, the maximum penalty will be three times their value. Where the value cannot be ascertained, there is a maximum fine now set at $50,000. There is another category of offences which 'strike at the basis of Customs control'-for example, interfering with a container before clearance by Customs, which will now carry a penalty again of $50,000 with lesser offences carrying penalties of between $1,000 and $10,000. These penalties do not seem to the Opposition to be unreasonable and they appear to it in all the circumstances to be appropriate to the offences concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        We notice that gaol terms are not specified, unlike in the narcotics context, which involves not only fines but also imprisonment. I suppose that there is a question as to whether that residual penalty, gaol, might not be appropriate in certain circumstances, particularly where very large sums of money or very deliberate frauds, such as the horse meat racket, are involved. We note further that, consequent upon the increased penalties, other amendments increase the jurisdictional level of lower and intermediate courts. Previously, because most fines were under $1,000, matters were dealt with by courts of summary jurisdiction and intermediate courts. The amendments now allow courts of summary jurisdiction to deal with matters up to the level of $5,000 and courts of intermediate jurisdiction to deal with matters up to the level of $20,000. There are other matters of that kind-for example, provision is being made to enable offences involving duty evasion of less than $500 to be dealt with administratively, as are presently small offences committed by arriving international travellers and crew. All those matters we regard as appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other changes in the Bill-which I retail again more or less to indicate simply that we have read it, because we do not oppose them-include a new Part VA, which provides for the licensing of depots which hold goods prior to examination by Customs, which provisions are virtually identical to existing provisions relating to licensing warehouses. Again, there is a whole miscellany of amendments which update procedures and a number of other matters. These are the kind of amendments that are made virtually every year as circumstances and practices change, following what has necessarily been a process of continuous review of the legislation. Again, we have no unfavourable comments to make in that general area.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, a number of submissions have been received by all members of parliament, I guess-certainly by those of us with the responsibility of carriage of these matters-addressing themselves to particular matters which have given cause for concern. I refer in particular to the extensive submissions that we have received from the Australian Federation of Air Freight Forwarders, from the Australian Chamber of Shipping and from the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia, all of which bodies have a very direct and immediate commercial interest in the viability of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the area that has provoked most widespread concern goes to questions of the right of appeal from or review of various administrative decisions. It has been proposed, for example, that there be review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of administrative decisions made pursuant to those sections of the Customs Act which are either amended or initiated by clauses 7, 10, 12, 14 and 30 of this Bill. As to these matters, we know that the Government has received these submissions, but there simply was not any acknowledgment of that fact in the House of Representatives debate. Mr John Brown, our spokesman, specifically mentioned the submissions and gave them to the Minister acting in this area, Mr Hodgman, who said that he would follow up the question and get back to our spokesman, which I understand he has never done. So, as far as we know and as far as, I understand, the lobbyists know, there simply has not been a satisfactory response to the matters which I mention.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I take this opportunity to do now is simply again to ask the Minister to assure the Senate in his response that these matters were examined by the Government and, more importantly, that they will be referred specifically to the Administrative Review Council, which is reviewing, as part of a large task, the adequacy of review and appeal mechanisms in the Customs area. We do not on this occasion express necessarily any decided view as to the appropriateness of appeal or review provisions being upgraded in the way that has been requested. We are simply concerned and keen to establish that the Government understands the nature of the arguments that are being put by the bodies most affected by this issue and has taken them on board and, to the extent that it has not been able to on this occasion, will refer them to the Administrative Review Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to rights of appeal, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has been concerned with the lack of rights of appeal apparent in clauses 7, 12, 14 and 32 of this Bill and as to the non-appealable discretions vested in the Minister with respect to fees in clauses 18 and 24. Senator Tate will, I understand, have a little more to say about the recommendations of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in this and, perhaps, other areas. I simply make the point that it seems that the Government's view is that these matters are inappropriate for review. I believe, with the other members of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee , and indeed to the extent that these points are also made by the lobbyists to which I have referred, that it is appropriate that reconsideration be given by the Government to the provision of a right of review or appeal in this area. Again, I ask that we be assured that the Administrative Review Council has been given the very specific job of looking at these matters and advising the Government on them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter which has been of concern to those who have made more extensive submissions in this area is clause 24 of the Bill, which creates a new section- section 106 (2) (d). What is in issue here is misleading statements by persons and the relevance of those to the question whether the persons are fit and proper to hold a licence. The suggestion being made is that misleading statements should have implications for the granting of a licence only in the event that the statement was knowingly made. This is a matter about which reasonable men, not to mention reasonable women, can differ, as to the appropriateness of implying or requiring some mens rea test, perhaps. Again, my inclination and that of the Opposition is to take the view that this is a reasonable request. It may be that there are other policy considerations which need to be taken into account. I simply ask on this matter not that the Government reconsider the legislation here and now, but that next time the Bill is being amended-it is a fairly constant process with customs and excise legislation-further consideration be given to that question.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one remaining matter that gets attention from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in its report on this Bill and that is clause 17, which amends existing section 82 (1). At present section 82 (1) (c) obliges warehouse licence holders to give the Comptroller of Customs written particulars of the bankruptcy or certain convictions of any 'person who participates in the management or control of the warehouse' within 30 days of that happening. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has suggested that this obligation should fall only where a licence holder again knows or ought reasonably to have known about the convictions in question. This is a question which we do not propose to push to the stage of a Committee stage amendment but it is an appropriate matter which we draw to the attention of the Government for consideration the next time this legislation is reviewed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have referred to a variety of matters, some of which might be thought more appropriate for the Committee stage. I simply wish to express in a compendious way, and not to trouble the Senate at the Committee stage with any further articulation of these matters, what some of the areas of concern in fact are. I ask the Government in its response to indicate that all these points have been taken on board and that they will be given its usual sensitive, sympathetic and intelligent consideration.

         —The Customs and Excise Amendment Bill 1982 has had a somewhat tortuous passage through the Parliament. It was first introduced on 24 March of this year by Mr John Moore, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. The legislation has survived two changes of Ministers and a change of department. It now comes for consideration by the Senate. The main purpose of the Bill, as was outlined quite fully by Senator Evans, is to increase the penalties for Customs offences. On this aspect of the Bill we are in complete agreement. The whole Customs administration is long overdue for a thorough review. This Bill goes a long way to tightening up many of the procedures and giving customs procedures that have grown up over the years the benefit of legislation to cover these practices.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The existing penalties, of course, were quite obviously inadequate. We believe that this Bill is important in that the penalties are substantially increased. We congratulate the Government on bringing forward this Bill and we support the main thrust of what it seeks to achieve. We also congratulate the Government on its announcement that the whole former Bureau of Customs is to be streamlined and made more efficient. We think this is very much to the good in an area that obviously needs very detailed attention. It needs detailed attention because, of course, we in this country are being subjected to organised crime which is directing its attention to the importation of illegal commodities and drugs. We must have an efficient Australian Customs Service.
       </para>
       <para>
        We received, as did the Australian Labor Party, submissions from various industry groups. These submissions were quite detailed and cogently argued. As we always do when we receive submissions from industry and concerned parties, we considered them very carefully. In fact, we even went to the point of having amendments drafted to cover some of the more important submissions from various industry groups. Parker and Lord, for instance, Customs attorneys, had no fewer than eight suggestions for amendments to this legislation. I want to make it clear that we considered their amendments carefully and, as I have said, even went to the point of drafting amendments. But for a variety of reasons, on which I intend to touch only briefly, we do not propose to move any of these amendments at this stage. Nevertheless, it is worthy of note that the Government seems to have dismissed the industries' submissions in a very high-handed way. In fact, in the other place it went so far as to deny knowledge of some of the submissions which we find almost incredible. Leaving that aside I turn to the point Senator Tate raised. Many of these submissions would present very considerable difficulties in the drafting of legislation. Senator Evans touched on some of those difficulties so I will not go over that ground again. But to suggest in submissions a requirement that the legislation take account of whether somebody knowingly gives evidence is, I think, being a little optimistic .
       </para>
       <para>
        We felt that most of the submissions we received from industry were impracticable. The submission that gave us most concern related to a request that rights of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal be granted in respect of certain discretions in the Bill. There is no doubt that there is a very great need for the right of appeal to be incorporated in the legislation at some time. Nevertheless, we were aware that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and particularly Senator Tate who is on that Committee, have made a very detailed submission on the rights of appeal in various areas of this legislation. Many of the points raised by Senator Tate were not covered by the industries' submissions and vice versa. We are also aware that the Administrative Review Council is looking at the whole area of discretions. It has yet to make its recommendations. For all these reasons it seemed to us to be unwise to introduce amendments which would tackle the right of appeal in an ad hoc way. However, we stress, as Senator Evans stressed, the need for the Government to look at this matter. We believe the rights of individuals can be stamped upon by too much Executive responsibility. The rights of appeal must be looked at and we look forward to the Government's assurance in that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is significant that the former Bureau had been operating under the existing legislation for over 14 years and that in fact there have been very few complaints. This aspect was taken into account in our final decision not to proceed with any requests or amendments to this legislation. We believe it is important that it has a speedy passage through this chamber. As I said earlier, there is an urgent need for a tightening of the whole administrative procedures of Customs. They are under great pressure. We welcome the Government's efforts in this area. We can only hope that the obvious problems that exist in the Service at the moment will continue to receive the Government's urgent and careful attention and that we can look forward to a series of Bills in relation to Customs matters which will give effect to a streamlining of the whole Customs area.

         —Very early this week I determined that I would cast my eye over the order of business and find an opportunity to talk on the Costigan report. I have found my opportunity. Before the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) despairs, I say that it is only a sort of catalyst to some wider-ranging remarks I wish to make. I refer to paragraph 12 of chapter 10 of the report of the Royal Commissioner, Mr Costigan. After he described the various levels of criminal enterprise which operate in Australia Mr Costigan came to what one might call the base group which he largely identified with the painters and dockers. He said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The final group consists of the criminals who execute the schemes. They may be called upon to man the hotels as SP bookmakers. They may be asked to distribute drugs, or to fire the gun, or use the cosh. It is they who move the containers, or remove from them the contraband, . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That gives me my opening. I repeat: 'It is they who move the containers, or remove from them the contraband'. The Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs which reported on 21 December 1979 was conducted by the honourable Mr Justice Williams, as honourable senators will recall. In the report of that Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs one reads of the concern of the Commissioner that in fact there had been a movement of drugs into Australia by way of cargo coming into the country without sufficient or adequate surveillance by the then Bureau of Customs. For example, at page A209 he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Many witnesses drew attention to the potentiality for smuggling through cargo, especially in containerised cargo. The volume of all types of cargo entering Australia, the size of individual containers and the need to facilitate cargo to consignees combine to give what some witnesses described as 'the perfect opportunity' to smuggle not only drugs but other types of illegal importations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Royal Commissioner details on that page and the few succeeding pages some instances which were brought to his attention in which on various waterfronts around Australia methods of Customs clearance were such that the weaknesses in them allowed contraband to come into Australia in a way which would not have been the case had Customs preventive measures been more assiduously and properly pursued. One reads in Book B of the report of the Royal Commissioner some recommendations as to ways in which the entry into Australia of these undesired goods might be prevented. He makes a recommendation at page B170. I remind the Senate that I am speaking of a report of 21 December 1979. I think it became a parliamentary paper in March 1980. A recommendation of the Royal Commissioner made all those years ago stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Customs legislation relating to cargo should be amended as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        A new section be inserted into the Customs Act to provide that no goods shall be brought into Australia in a cargo container unless such a container has been sealed with a seal or fastener approved by the Comptroller-General and all such seals and fasteners are marked with an individual identifying number which is recorded on all documents presented to obtain Customs clearance of the container and its contents.
       </para>
       <para>
        He stated further:
       </para>
       <para>
        A new section be inserted into the Customs Act to provide that any person who takes delivery of a container which has its seal or fastener broken or altered or otherwise tampered with must notify a Collector of Customs immediately of that fact. It should be an offence to open, alter, make, break, tamper, or otherwise deal with a container seal without the authority in writing of the Collector.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the fact that those manifestly desirable recommendations were made by Mr Justice Williams almost three years ago there is, to my great disappointment, nothing in this legislation which provides for the sealing or fastening of containers in the way which he recommended. There can be little doubt, as one reads the various royal commission reports, that the entry into Australia of drugs, arms and ammunition by this means is such that one would have expected those recommendations to be taken up.
       </para>
       <para>
        One finds, indeed, that the Auditor-General in his report of September 1982-it has just been made available to honourable senators in recent days-said in his commentary on the Department of Industry and Commerce that he conducted an audit in Queensland and Western Australia which revealed control weaknesses which impaired the effectiveness of the cargo control system. He went on to generalise from his audit of Western Australia and Queensland districts about the situation which obtained throughout Australia. I remind honourable senators that this report was presented some three years after Mr Justice Williams indicated the necessity for the institution of proper issue and use of cargo container seals. Under the heading 'Cargo Control' the Auditor-General stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Cargo containers are normally sealed by companies or agents responsible for loading at overseas ports. The seals should remain intact until the containers are released from Customs control. However, instances were noted where:
       </para>
       <para>
        the resealing of a container was carried out by a pest control company following fumigation
       </para>
       <para>
        broken seals were replaced by shipping companies, and
       </para>
       <para>
        seals were attached with tape to the container door.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the issue and use of seals are outside the control of Customs and if the system is to be relied upon, an assessment is necessary of the effectiveness of the control over seals exercised by the companies and agents.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Auditor-General went on to have a look at the process of checking seals. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Although departmental procedures require the checking of seals, these were not always carried out effectively. It was observed that during a routine check carried out by Customs officers:
       </para>
       <para>
        the seals on the containers selected for detailed inspection were not checked prior to the release of the container, and
       </para>
       <para>
        the seal was not intact when the officers arrived at the consignee's premises after the container was delivered, but no further action was taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        Page after page then follows of the Auditor-General's comments on the lack of security over containers, the lack of control checks and the release of consignments, as I said earlier, without the proper individual surveillance of their contents. As I said, there are three or four pages of such details in the Auditor-General's report. At page 51 of the report, the Auditor-General concluded:
       </para>
       <para>
        The revenue and other implications of failures to adhere to satisfactory Cargo Control and Accounting procedures are extremely serious.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be said that very little has been done in these last three years-in fact, nothing has been done-to follow up the suggestions of Royal Commissioner Williams on this matter. No doubt this also formed the basis for many of Mr Costigan's observations that criminal elements were using the waterfront, particularly the containerised system, to move drugs and other illicit articles into Australia. Nothing has been done in those three years. It may be said that nothing can be done because we are awaiting some international convention to be brought into effect to allow government seals to be attached at the ports of dispatch and that it is only through a system of government seals being instituted and internationally recognised that one will be able to control the problem sufficiently.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think that it is a sufficient answer. It obviously was not seen as a sufficient answer by Mr Justice Williams or the Auditor-General. When there are instances of company seals attached overseas being obviously tampered with and this not being followed up in a sufficiently diligent manner by our own Customs officers then there is great cause for concern. In fact, I think one could reasonably conclude that damage to revenue and to our whole social fabric has been as serious as the Auditor-General indicates. As an ordinary back bencher I feel there may be a deficiency in the Bill. As a member of the Opposition I hope that the Bill will have a fairly speedy passage. Insofar as it increases substantially the penalties provided for contraventions of the Act and makes some amendments, it is welcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has had a look at the Bill. It came to the conclusion that it would not pursue a matter which it was alerted to by a consideration of the Bill but which affects the Act as a whole. The Committee made the general comment that while section 273GA of the Customs Act provided for certain specific decisions to be subject to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, only limited rights of appeal are generally available under the Act. The Committee indicated that a number of provisions in the present Bill were not subject to rights of appeal. For example, it looked at amendments included in clauses 7, 12, 14 and 32. It further pointed out that clauses 18 and 25 propose the vesting of non-appealable discretions in the Minister by amendments to sections 83 and 108 of the Act respectively, although appeals under these sections were available against decisions by the Comptroller -General or Collector of Customs. The fact is that the question of appeals against decisions under the Customs Act is presently under review by the Administrative Review Council. Therefore, it was decided that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee would not press amendments or suggestions in relation to the individual provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee wrote to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) drawing his attention to the matter, and the Minister was courteous enough to reply to the Committee. I must say that this relationship which is growing between the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and Ministers is entirely to be welcomed. I am sure that honourable senators would agree that the role of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is much enhanced if indeed as a result of the circulation of the Alert Digest the Executive enters into discussion with a view to trying to meet the points made by the Committee in those Alert Digests.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister, in his response, made the point that the provisions to which we referred were basic to the discharge of Customs responsibilities, crucial to the exercise of effective control by Customs and directed to the prevention of the introduction of undesirable imports and the erosion of revenue. That view has been put by the Government to the Administrative Review Council in its submission. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee and, I suggest, the chamber perhaps ought to await the report of the Administrative Review Council in order to come to a balanced and responsible conclusion as to the desirability of some appeal mechanism. It would be unfortunate if, in pursuing the particular right that we might say ought to inhere in people who are affected by decisions under the Customs Act, we were to risk the erosion of revenue or the importing of undesirable goods into this country. Obviously some balance ought to be struck, and with this matter under review by the Administrative Review Council I think the chamber can have some confidence that that report will be such as will enable us as senators to draw sensible and practical conclusions as to the type of amendments that might then be moved to incorporate some further rights of appeal if they are thought to be desirable. I would think as to particular clauses it might well be that during the Committee stage some remarks by members of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee might then be made.As to the Bill as a whole, certainly the Opposition wishes it a speedy passage.

         —I thank the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for their general support of the Bill. Several matters were raised by Senators Evans, Tate and Siddons. A number of them were repetitive but I will endeavour to address one or two of the major points. First, Senator Evans sought some further information in connection with the restructuring of the Australian Bureau of Customs. He referred to the media statement last Sunday made by the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Fife, in connection with the new arrangements for the formation of the Australian Customs Service.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I should point out that this important step is the culmination of almost five years of development work involving departmental staff, staff associations and the Public Service Board. During late 1977 and early 1978 the inspection concept was developed and formally submitted to the Public Service Board in April 1978. This concept was the basic factor in the whole restructuring exercise. It proposes a single employment category of Customs officers. Detailed consultations commenced with staff associations in December 1980 and have continued until recently, with all associations now advising agreement to the implementation. Their suggestions were all carefully considered and where appropriate were adopted. The new organisation will lead to the upgrading of Customs controls in accordance with government policies in relation to industry and community protection. I hope also that that substantially will answer some of the major concerns mentioned by Senator Tate in his remarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, Senator Evans referred to the creation of the Service in a little more detail and drew attention to the fact that this appeared to be some kind of response to recent events. I should draw his attention to the ministerial statement made by the Honourable Neil Brown, Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs at the time, on 'Review of Customs Administration'. This statement was, I think, tabled in the House of Representatives in about April of this year. On page 2 of the statement Mr Brown said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In this respect I inform the House that a great deal of work has already been completed by the Department and the Public Service Board on a major restructuring of the Customs organisation throughout the Commonwealth. The proposed restructuring includes the introduction of a single work category of Customs Officer which should lead to the elimination of work demarcation tensions now present. The Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended the early introduction of a single work category.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the Senate's attention to that statement because it does, I think, make the point that this matter has been under consideration for a considerable time. It addresses itself to some of the problems and difficulties which I think Senator Tate foresaw and was referring to in his remarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans furthermore drew attention to the fact that Mr A. G. Mayhew, a senior preventive officer, grade 1, in the Sydney office of the Department, had recently decided to retire. I thought for the record that it would be useful if the Senate had the benefit of a statement on this matter. I make the following points. Mr Mayhew did in fact have a discussion, at his request, with the Collector of Customs in New South Wales on 24 June 1982 during which he expressed concern about his health and talked about possible retirement. He was advised to see his own doctor. He did that and apparently on the next day produced a medical certificate from his doctor which suggested retirement. An appointment was made for Mr Mayhew to be examined by a Commonwealth medical officer in Sydney. Following that examination, the Commonwealth medical officer arranged for Mr Mayhew to see a specialist. The specialist subsequently reported to the Commonwealth medical officer who recommended to the Department that Mr Mayhew was unfit for continued employment and should be retired on medical grounds. Mr Mayhew was advised of the Commonwealth medical officer's report and that a declaration in terms of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act had been signed stating that he could not reasonably be employed in the Department because of his physical incapacity. His rights of appeal against that decision were notified to him. A recommendation for Mr Mayhew's retirement was then made to the Public Service Board's regional office in Sydney which, under the Act, has the responsibility of determining whether, in the light of the medical evidence, retirement is warranted. Mr Mayhew waived his rights of appeal against the declaration and indicated that he had no objection to retirement on invalidity grounds. It is understood that an officer of the Public Service Board discussed Mr Mayhew's proposed retirement with him last week. At the moment, the Department is awaiting a decision from the Public Service Board. Mr Mayhew has been on continuous sick leave since 25 June and has indicated that, if his invalidity retirement is approved, he would like it to be effective from 1 October.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Siddons referred to matters of concern, which were referred to by Senator Evans and Senator Tate, in connection with representations made by various organisations in respect of the lack of review and appeal rights in the legislation. Some assertions were made that the Government had made no attempt to answer those representations. I understand the situation to be that the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, did reply to those representations from the organisations mentioned by Senator Siddons, albeit perhaps at a time subsequent to the debate in the House of Representatives on the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill. So, in that sense, no discourtesy was intended in respect of dealing with those submissions from the various organisations. In fact, all due consideration was given to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans made the point that the Government appeared to be of the mind that it would be inappropriate for review procedures to be installed in the Act. That is not so. Indeed, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which was referred to by Senator Tate, at paragraph 5 on page 2 of its report drew attention to the fact that the Administrative Review Council was continuing its review of the appeal provisions and that the relevant department had made submissions to the Council in relation to this Bill. The Committee drew these matters to the attention of the Senate for information. It seems to me that, in the light of the fact that this matter is before the ARC for consideration at the present time, a number of matters need to be take into account. The action which has been flagged by Senator Siddons on behalf of the Australian Democrats, and I believe by Senator Evans in his general comments, that we should allow that process to develop so that we can obtain further information from that august body as to its views on the matter in this area is the appropriate action to take. Before regulations will be set up under this legislation, industry and various industry organisations will be consulted before their finalisation. Consequently there will be an opportunity for views to be taken on board, which I think was the expression used by Senator Siddons.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans made one further point in relation to the restructuring of the Department of Industry and Commerce and was very interested to obtain further information. This is a matter on which I will need to refer to the Minister to obtain his clearance. I understand the position to be that the Public Service Board is currently reviewing the matter and is getting close to finalising its views on the representations made by the Department. Subsequent upon that it would be feasible for the Government to make information upon the restructuring available to the Parliament. I undertake to refer those questions to the Minister and to see whether there might be something more than can be said in that regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tate made several points in relation to containerised cargo. It is relevant to note that increased resources have been made available to examine cargo and that new procedures have been operating from 15 March this year. Tightened controls have been implemented over the movement of containerised cargo. There is also an increased intelligence capability in Customs to assess risk and to determine possible targets in this area. It is physically impossible -I believe Senator Tate would agree with me-to review, sight and check all containers. Senator Tate drew our attention to the use of seals. One would have to say that seals would be of questionable value in Customs control, particularly when one has regard to the fact that it would be the responsibility of the shipping companies to put the seals on the containers. I understand that currently an international study is occurring in Brussels in order to determine the role of Customs and the use of seals in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter which Senate Tate mentioned concerned the Auditor-General's report and that the points raised in the report only became public in the last week or so. The Government is considering these matters. I thank honourable senators for their general support of the legislation. I wish the Bill a speedy passage.

         —Clause 17 of the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill deals with the conditions which apply in relation to warehouse licences. I record the fact that in private submissions to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills the attention of the Committee was drawn to section 82 of the principal Act which clause 17 seeks to amend. It was put to the Committee that an amendment might be made to the existing provision so that the obligation falling on a warehouse licence holder to notify the Collector if a person participating in the management or control of a warehouse were convicted of a prescribed offence or became bankrupt should arise only if the licence holder had reasonable grounds for knowing that such a conviction or bankruptcy had occurred.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I believe Senator Siddons and Senator Evans have already commented on whether that would be a practicable type of amendment to make to section 82 (1) of the principal Act. The Committee did take up the matter with the appropriate Minister. We sought his advice and received a reply which led us to the conclusion that the Committee should draw the existing provision to the attention of this chamber for its information but should not itself make any particular proposal as to the desirability of amending the principal Act in the way that was sought to be done. We did so on the very clear understanding that the undertaking by the Minister was that section 82 would be caught up in an ongoing review of the provisions of the Customs Act. We take that to mean something more specific than merely the general review which is maintained over any Act which a Minister or department is required to administer and that, in fact, some specific attention will be given in the near future to that submission concerning section 82 (1).
       </para>
       <para>
        We were also concerned with clause 17 (c), which inserts into section 82 (2) an ability to prescribe regulations. Section 82 (2) presently reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        A warehouse licence is subject to such other conditions, if any, as are prescribed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The clause seeks to insert in section 82 (2) the purposive words 'for the protection of the revenue, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Customs Acts or otherwise'. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee was concerned to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) some understanding of what the words 'or otherwise' mean because if the warehouse licence is to be subject to conditions which are prescribed otherwise than for the protection of the revenue or otherwise than for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Customs Act, it seems a very odd circumstance that such regulations could properly be made. It seems that a very open charter is being given to the prescriber of the regulations. I must say that I found the response by the Minister to be somewhat unsatisfactory. The Minister made this point:
       </para>
       <para>
        The expression 'or otherwise' has been included because requiring something to be done or observed in a particular way in respect of goods which fall into that statutory category of 'goods which are subject to the control of the Customs' may not be regarded, in the stricter sense, as requiring 'compliance with the Customs Act'.
       </para>
       <para>
        To be quite frank, I find it very difficult to comprehend the meaning of that paragraph. The Minister went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Due regard should be had also to the fact that the provision being amended does not relate to discretionary exercise of powers but is one authorising the prescribing of regulations. The overriding regulation-making power in section 270 of the Customs Act authorises the making only of regulations that are not inconsistent with the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is complete and utter balderdash. It is a fact that we are dealing here with a regulation-making power. If the Minister had gone on to say 'and therefore the Regulations and Ordinances Committee will have an opportunity to look at the product of that regulation-making power' and that in itself provides some effective safeguard against the misuse of this power which, as I say, seems to have a very open charter by the addition of the words 'or otherwise', I could have grasped it and understood what is intended. But to say that somehow section 270, in authorising the making of regulations that are not inconsistent with the Act, somehow overrides or controls the proposed new section 82 (2) is completely and utterly wrong because the proposed new section 82 (2) becomes something consistent with the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that we now have a situation where conditions may be attached to warehouse licences. As I say, section 82 (2) will read:
       </para>
       <para>
        A warehouse licence is subject to such other conditions, if any, as are prescribed for the protection of the revenue, for the purpose of . . . the Customs Act or otherwise.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an extremely wide charter. There is no way in which section 270 inhibits , restricts or controls what may be done in the prescribing of those regulations . Indeed, the only safeguard is the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I assure the Minister and the Department that the Committee will be very astute in examining what might emerge from an exercise of that regulation-making power.

         —Senator Tate obviously has an advantage over most of us in having had very detailed discussions on these matters with the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). I am only able to reiterate the Minister's views as established in the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I indicate that there is a general need to ensure the widest possible opportunity for the Department of Industry and Commerce to enforce its rights rather than to have them limited to a degree by relying purely and simply on words written in black and white in the legislation. Because of that, I believe the slightly wider context of the phrase used by the Minister is in fact appropriate. But in the light of Senator Tate's concern and continuing worries about this matter, I believe it would be appropriate naturally for him to raise the matter further with the Minister. Clearly, there are always ongoing reviews of this kind. As he would know, the Minister will also be considering other matters in relation to this consequent upon any later reports by the Administrative Review Council or whatever. I wonder whether Senator Tate will accept for the time being the proposition that we will endeavour to raise his concerns with the Minister and establish a basis for later discussion between him and the Minister on this point.

         —As I have already indicated, the Opposition will not press any amendment at the Committee stage because it wants to see the passage of this legislation as speedily as practicable. But I make the point that at the moment the wording of section 82 (2) restricts by implication the imposing of conditions to those conditions which are consistent with achieving the purposes of the Customs Act. That is just a normal piece of statutory construction. But the amendment obviously goes much further than that in putting in purposive words which go much further than saying 'for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Customs Act' and which are in my view unnecessary when it goes on to say 'or otherwise'. Perhaps I would have my mind set at ease if the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), or the Minister in consultation with his advisers, could give me an example of what must have been in the minds of the advisers, the Department or the Minister when it was felt necessary to add those words? What sort of conditions might be attached to a warehouse licence other than those necessary for the protection of the revenue or to ensure compliance with the Act?

         —That has set my mind greatly at ease. I think I ought to comment on clause 19 because really it involves a matter of some importance in the history of the proceedings of the Parliament. Clause 19 deals with the suspension of warehouse licences. Without going into the details, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills entered into some correspondence with the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) over the possibility that long term licence holders might be disadvantaged by amendments proposed in the Bill in relation to licence renewals. This related to 10-year periods and their accumulation. Perhaps the details of that need not be gone into at this stage. It is pleasing to note that an amendment was made to the Bill in accordance with the desires of the Committee during the passage of the Bill through the House of Representatives. I do not say that the Committee necessarily brought about this amendment to the Bill during its passage through the House of Representatives but our Committee was one of several groups and persons who made representations to the Minister in this regard. It is pleasing to see the flexibility of the Minister and of the Government in acknowledging a point well made and in making the necessary change in the Bill's passage through the Parliament.

        As announced in the Budget Speech, the Government has decided on two sales tax changes. Legislation for one of them-an increase of 2.5 percentage points in existing rates-has just been introduced. The Bill I am now introducing deals with the second aspect and will impose sales tax of 7.5 per cent on a range of goods that are now exempt from the tax. This extension of the sales tax base will have effect on goods that pass the taxing point-normally the last wholesale sale-on or after 1 January 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        I drew attention last year to the clear advantage that lies in effecting some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes. I again emphasise the potential that such a change generates for desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax. The technical effect of the Bill will be to tax at 7.5 per cent, on and after 1 January 1983, goods which are at present exempted by items 53, 58, 105, 107 and 113F, sub-items (4), (5A), (6), (7) and ( 10) of item 120 and item 120A in the first schedule. The broad classes of goods which fall within the scope of the items other than 113F are maps, hand tools, motion picture films, household drapery and soft furnishings, cleaning and polishing cloths, braid, ribbon and tape, blankets, handkerchiefs and cleaning sponges and engine-cleaning cotton waste. The goods covered by item 113F are, very broadly, servicing equipment and construction equipment. More particularly, this equipment covers servicing equipment used to service, repair or recondition motor vehicles, aircraft, ships or railway rolling stock or in retreading and repairing of tyres and repairing of footwear for human wear. The item also covers equipment used for constructing, maintaining or repairing buildings or other structures, or roads, dams, pipelines, drains, trenches, tunnels or other works.
       </para>

        I should emphasise that this item deals with equipment, et cetera which is used in the course of servicing, repair or construction as the case may be. It does not include goods which become part of the goods being repaired or the structures being built. Using buildings as an example, equipment for use in contruction of a building will become taxable at 7.5 per cent but the materials used to construct the building and that thereby become part of the building will remain exempt from sales tax. I emphasise that goods falling within any of these categories will still be exempt from sales tax if they are sold in circumstances in which an overriding exemption in the first schedule to the Sales Tax ( Exemptions and Classifications) Act applies. Similarly, where a manufacturer purchases such goods for use as 'aids to manufacture', the goods will remain exempt under the 'aids to manufacture' head of exemption. I do not think that I need to go into greater detail at this stage. As usual, however, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bill is being made available to honourable senators and this provides details of the goods affected by these measures. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $44m in 1982-83 and $105m in a full year. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        —We are debating the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1982 on which I will continue my remarks. It seems to me that the present restriction on access to overseas varieties stems directly from an absence of plant variety rights legislation in Australia. The reason for this is perhaps best described by a well-known writer, Bert Kelly-'The Modest Farmer' -who wrote in the Bulletin in 1980:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       We could import them (new varieties) but this is difficult if we have not passed the PVR legislation because people in countries with this legislation are usually unwilling to send us their new varieties because we could then turn around and sell our material back to their country in competition with them.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would add to that only that no businessman will voluntarily place at risk the very product which is his source of income. In the case of plant breeding the product is the seed which he is seeking to protect. There is an abundance of evidence, of course, that the absence of PVR legislation restricts access to overseas varieties. It ought to be emphasised that the frustration of Australian farmers and nurserymen is being compounded by the tremendous advances in productivity that are being made in many countries that presently enjoy PVR legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       A recent study by Mrs Silvey of the British National Institute of Agricultural Botany, published in the Institute's annual journal, is worthy of note. The study is very interesting in that it states that in the period between 1947 and 1977 the wheat yield in England and Wales had increased by approximately 94 per cent and the barley yield by 67 per cent which, in the case of wheat, is an increase from 2.4 tons per hectare to over 4.7 and in the case of barley from 2. 3 tons per hectare to 3.8 tons. Analysis of that empirical data also shows that of the 94 per cent yield increase in wheat, 56 percentage points was as a result of improved varieties. In the case of the barley yield, 32 per cent of the 67 per cent was the result of improved varieties.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst I would not seek to claim that the increased yield directly attributable to improved varieties was solely the result of PVR legislation-it is clearly not -what has occurred is that the PVR has provided a massive stimulus for plant breeding which necessarily ensures improved varieties. This is shown by the fact that almost half of the yield increases over the 30-year period have occurred in the last 10 years when the United Kingdom was enjoying PVR legislation. It is principally because of the productivity increase effect of PVR legislation that so many countries have introduced such legislation. When one looks at the list, which includes the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, New Zealand, Israel, Japan and the United States of America, one is left with a feeling that Australia and Australians are being left behind.
      </para>
      <para>
       A great many farmers have written to me expressing concern about the plant variety rights legislation because they have not clearly understood the public debate. They wanted to know how it would operate and how it would effect them. They sought information about accusations that have been made relating to multinationals and takeovers. For those people the proposed scheme can best be explained by way of an example. For the purpose of this explanation I will look at the way PVR will affect wheat growers. The first aspect that should be considered is the patenting of the seed. When a plant breeder produces a seed he may apply for registration. Of course, it must be emphasised that registration is not compulsory; it is certainly optional.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us assume that a breeder has produced a new variety of wheat seed. In order to obtain registration he must first satisfy the basic criteria under the Bill. These criteria are that the cultivar must be new, distinct, uniform and stable. It is worth stopping for a moment to consider the implications of these criteria . So far as the newness is concerned, this means that the variety must not have been grown commercially in the country of origin. From a wheat grower's point of view, he can totally ignore the new PVR system if he so wishes and chooses and he can continue to grow the same wheat without being in the slightest way affected by the provisions of the new Bill. It is only when he is interested in growing a new variety that has been registered that the PVR legislation will affect him.
      </para>
      <para>
       The criterion for distinctiveness requires that the new variety differ from all known varities in one or more important botanical or agronomical characters. In some respect, this is superfluous because no wheat grower will buy a seed at a higher cost if it is in no way different from the one he is presently using. The other two characteristics of uniformity and stability are fairly self- explanatory Having satisfied these criteria, a breeder must then apply for registration which, under the Bill, requires the agreement of the Australian Agricultural Council which of course comprises State and Federal Ministers for Primary Industry. It is perhaps worth noting that feature of the Bill for a moment to highlight the fact that the Agricultural Council will not give its consent to the registration of a new variety which is not generally supported by the industry and the various groups associated and interested in this area.
      </para>
      <para>
       Once a breeder has satisfied all of those requirements, and provided he is not challenged by a person lodging an objection under clause 17 of the Bill, he is then granted a patent which entitles him to the exclusive right-subject to safeguards which I will come to later-to sell that new variety. The wheat grower can thus consider the advantages and disadvantages of buying the new seed, as he chooses. It is in many ways similar to investing in a new stud bull. If you want higher productivity and better quality, and therefore a profitable return on your investment, you can obviously purchase, at a higher price, the new variety. But that choice, the assessment of whether it is in the grower's commercial interest to purchase the new variety, is left solely to the grower. There is no compulsion whatsoever to purchase.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us assume that the grower, having been impressed with the results obtained from studies carried out on the new variety, decides to buy the cultivar, sows the seed and harvests the crop. What happens then? First, he is entitled to sell his wheat regardless of anything in the plant variety rights legislation, subject of course to the requirements of the Australian Wheat Board. Secondly, he is entitled to re-sow the seeds of the harvest, use the grain for feeding stock or for any other purpose, regardless of anything in the legislation. It is only when the grower wants to sell the seeds of the harvest-and, of course, the actual seeds purchased from the breeders-that he may do so only in accordance with the terms of sale of the seed by the breeder to the grower. It is the right to control the sale of the seed, though not its use, that the Bill, in clause 32 , protects.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, should a breeder unreasonably restrict the sale of a variety, and not take steps to ensure that the reasonable requirements of the public in respect of that plant variety are satisfied, the Bill vests in the Secretary to the Department the right to license other breeders to produce that variety, so the first breeder loses his protection. That is not something that, in my view, any breeder would take lightly.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other major concern of the farming community and the nurserymen is the accusation that PVR legislation will lead to takeovers of plant breeding companies and, ultimately, control by multinational fertiliser companies of plant breeding. It is true that nothing in the Bill prevents company takeovers, which often occur in the free market and in that respect have nothing to do with PVR legislation per se. The experience in the United Kingdom has suggested that in any event these concerns are ill-founded. In Britain in 1977 there were 15 companies breeding vegetables, 47 breeding agricultural crops, 20 breeding decoratives and three breeding fruit. And this, it should be remembered, is after more than 15 years experience of PVR legislation in that country. Protection against attempts to monopolise the plant breeding market is also afforded by sections 45 to 50 of the Trade Practices Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another view that is put by the opponents of PVR is that if multinational fertiliser companies gain control of plant breeding they will produce seeds which will require their fertilisers and which are more susceptible to a wipe- out. This is simply not true because, firstly, farmers are not going to buy such seeds and, secondly, the Australian Agricultural Council would not agree to their registration.
      </para>
      <para>
       Similarly, the accusation that PVR will lead to genetic erosion is not sustainable. Genetic erosion may occur with or without PVR legislation and the stimulation given to the plant breeding industry in Australia would ensure an even greater genetic diversity. Certainly, the National Seed Storage Laboratory at Fort Collins, Colorado, which holds more than 380,000 varieties of seeds, in a country which has enjoyed PVR for some time, supports the view that genetic erosion will not occur as a result of PVR.
      </para>
      <para>
       One other point that I wish to make is that I am surprised that PVR legislation has encountered opposition from conservationists, because the increase in plant breeding may well see the development of varieties of seeds whose cultivation requires less pesticide and herbicide such as 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. Such seeds, attractive as they are to farmers, both for their comparative cost savings and environmental impact, may be one of the first of the new progeny developed under PVR legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, it should be noted that the cost of seeds produced and registered under PVR, to those growers who voluntarily choose to buy them, will be relatively small. Currently, the average royalty payment on seeds of protected United States wheat varieties is only 50c a bushel and, in the case of oats, only 30c. In 1978 in the United Kingdom, where PVR also operates, wheat seed was selling for the Australian equivalent of $12 a bushel, of which the royalty component was 65c or 5.4 per cent of the purchase price. The total cost to the Government of this whole proposal is estimated as approximately $50,000 per annum-hardly significant in the context of an overall Government expenditure of $42 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should like to conclude by referring the Senate to the question of monopolies and the stand by multinationals. I am reminded of the following statement made by Senator Childs in the Senate on this subject on 8 September:
      </para>
      <para>
       Perhaps the most sinister aspect of plant patents is that they are being pushed by huge multinational corporations which also have large interests in insecticides, fertilisers and other chemicals. I make no apology for criticising multinational companies such as Shell Oil, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz because they are typical of the companies involved. There will be two problems. These companies will make sure that the seeds which develop are dependent on their chemicals. This has happened in the United States of America. The very size and concentration of the industry could endanger agricultural diversity.
      </para>
      <para>
       There seems to be some conflict, confusion and debate within the Australian Labor Party itself. In that regard, I refer the Senate to comments made at an earlier date by one of Senator Childs's colleagues, who said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The second fallacy proposed by the Lygon Street farmers is that if any plant variety rights legislation were passed all farmers would be forced to buy seeds from the monopolists, who would soon gain control of seed production. That is wrong because most farmers keep their own seed and would be able to continue doing so. They could also keep indefinitely the seed of the varieties they are already growing. A refinement of the multinational conspiracy theory is that these monopolists, who are assumed to be multinationals, I suppose to increase the scare power of the theory, would then devote all their attention to producing hybrid seeds which would germinate or ripen only if they were treated with vast quantities of poisonous chemicals. That was supplemented frequently by allegations that as soon as plant variety rights legislation was passed in the United States of America something like 365 small seed companies were taken over by the said multi- nationals in the space of about 15 minutes. I have been able to find absolutely no evidence to support that allegation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude by saying that I trust this legislation will find its way safely through the Senate today. There has been a suggestion that it be referred to a select committee. It seems to me that the public is slowly becoming tired of continual attempts by the Australian Democrats and, in some cases, the Australian Labor Party, to refer anything that is remotely controversial to a committee. I suspect sometimes that the purpose is not to examine the content, value or virtue of the legislation but rather to give breathing time for certain honourable senators to study the direction of the winds of fortune and favour and make a determination, not upon the merits of legislation, but upon pragmatic political judgments. I hope that that will not be the fate of this legislation, which I recommend to the Senate. I trust it will have a speedy passage.

        —I propose to cover a number of points that certainly were not covered by my opponent, Senator Crichton-Browne. I would like to enlighten him concerning one or two points. I emphasise first that the determination of the Opposition to send this Bill to a standing committee-not a select committee-is in order to give everyone in the community an opportunity properly to debate the issue. It was in about 1971 that some people in this country began talking about creating a certain type of plant variety rights legislation. Over the last couple of years opposition to such legislation has certainly mounted in all quarters. I propose to quote from a couple of statements from quite reliable sources. They are not by people who might be looked upon by members of this conservative government as people without authority or any idea of what they are doing. They are reputable people whose arguments are well supported.

       At the outset, I wish to support without equivocation the amendment that Senator Walsh moved on behalf of the Opposition. My own view of the PVR legislation, in its present form, is that it is bad legislation and, if carried, would be very dangerous for this country. I am implacably opposed to it. The legislation has not been well handled by the Government at any stage. When it was first introduced in another place the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) was at great pains not to say too much about it. It was significant that he brought in his own amendments, which we considered to be completely inadequate. Our spokesman then moved a large number of amendments covering a wide range of the legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the matters in regard to this legislation in which the Opposition is in direct conflict with the Government concerns those who planned the legislation. After all, it was not planned by this Government. It has been forced on the Government by the transnational organisations who want to get their sticky little fingers onto the whole future of plant breeding in this country.

        —That is right. They are determined to do it, so the Minister who introduced the Bill in the first place was put under great pressure by these organisations. We ought to remember first of all that seeds and all other forms of genetic material are not the playthings of individuals, single organisations or groups of powerful organisations. They should always remain a public resource and should always remain the property of the people. The seeds of the earth are a common heritage and as such should be treated with that sort of respect. Our generation relies on a great deal of its food coming from the earth. Indirectly we obtain our protein through eating beef and similar types of food, and we need the growing things to sustain the stock that we use to produce beef, milk, butter and what have you.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The plant variety rights legislation will encourage the narrowing of the genetic base of common plant varieties. From memory, a Mexican farmer came under very severe restriction because of the narrowing variety of seeds that he could buy. They produced a sturdy plant but one which would not stand up to the plant diseases and pests that the normal hardy plant will stand up to. He eventually found that a new type of moth had bred and his tomato crop was completely eaten away. He then found from the same agrochemical company from which he bought his seed that he had to buy a type of pesticide to dispose of the moths. Finally, he decided that if he did not get out of the whole show altogether the moths would eventually eat him. The farmers and other growers will be forced to pay royalties for seeds and plants, this will result in new taxes. I propose to enlarge on this in a few moments. The funding of the seed collection will bring up a new type of tax, as will the maintenance of seed banks and the administration of the plant variety rights legislation. All of this will place a charge on the people who make a living out of this industry and who provide the vegetables and other types of food that we eat.
      </para>
      <para>
       In spite of what Senator Crichton-Browne said, foreign ownership of the Australian plant breeding and seed industry will be only a matter of time. If this legislation is passed this session, by the middle of next year inroads will have been made by the transnational companies. Already those companies are starting to make minor inroads into this particular industry. It will create injustice for those countries of the Third World from where most of the genetic material used in plant breeding comes. I think that has been mentioned in other places; certainly I referred to it in a story I wrote for a newspaper some time ago. Most of the plants of genetic purity are still to be found around the equator, where they have not been subject to an ice age. What might happen to our native flora? If the transnational companies get their hands on our flora they will breed from it and eventually sell it back to us.

       There are many doubts about the value of PVR legislation. As recently as February this year Norway decided not to introduce it. Canada, like Australia, has had the matter hanging around for some time and the chances are that such legislation will not be introduced in that country either. Austria and Finland both have known or exclusive type plant patents but all they do is levy the royalties; they do not control the markets. Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned a number of countries, many of which are members of the European Economic Community. The EEC has ordered a study of the effects of plant variety rights legislation on its member states. I think this is to be carried out by a commissioner or commissioners. Let me refer to the United Kingdom legislation which is a little tighter than the American legislation, although America has gone cold on PVR. It has been trying to introduce amendments for a long time and unless it has happened in recent weeks, it has been unsuccessful. The Shell company in the United Kingdom now has control of 60 seed companies. Ten years ago it did not control one single company in the United Kingdom. It also has under its control 40 per cent of all the patented varieties and 50 per cent of all the barley varieties as of last year.

Now Shell and two other companies have 85 per cent of the packeted seed trade in the United Kingdom. Shell did not have that sort of control until it was assisted by plant variety rights legislation. That will occur here no matter what the honourable senator says. It may not necesssarily be that company but other companies with similar ambitions will do it.

       The Australian Consumers Association has taken a very searching and critical view of the legislation. I propose shortly to quote some of its statements for the record. A coalition of a number of organisations, ranging from the Action for World Development group, through the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, the Food Justice Centre, Friends of the Earth, the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales and the Queensland Conservation Council down to the Victorian Consumer Action Group, produced a paper in 1981. I am not sure of the exact date ; it was fairly late in the year. I want to quote two or three paragraphs from it. It said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Foreign ownership of Australia's plant breeding and seed industry would be the result of Plant Variety Rights. This reputable group of organisations there contradicts the views of Senator Crichton-Browne.
      </para>
      <para>
       The paper continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       Plant Variety Rights would threaten the livelihoods of small seed merchants, and farmers, small seed growers and nursery persons.
      </para>
      <para>
       Large scale enterprises with national and international marketing networks would benefit most from the proposed Plant Variety Rights scheme since it sets up the national co-ordination of plant and seed production and sales through the granting of monopoly rights. As in the present industrial patent system, most plant variety rights would be granted to overseas companies, thus laying the foundation for the foreign control of our major seed and plant markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       Patents have been used in U.S.A. and Europe to mark out commercial territory in the seed and pharmaceutical industry. In the U.S.A. in any one crop a few companies own the majority of seed patents. The same form of market control would be exercised by foreign plantbreeding firms in Australia.

       The rejection of Plant Variety Rights will not only make possible co-operative and sound plant breeding within Australia, but it will also give a great boost to Third World countries and international plant breeders who are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with the global effects of Plant Variety Rights and the priorities of those large corporations who are utilising P.V.R. to take up a dominant position in the world seed industry to the detriment of small farmers whose needs are overlooked.

Most of us read this paper and I think that most of us were disgusted with the biased attitude of the paper in favour of the Bill.

       Mr Hollamby also showed that wheat yields in the U.K. had increased by 2% per year between 1947-77 due to genetic improvement with no discernible change in the rate since 1965 when P.V.R. was introduced in the U.K. By way of contrast Australian yield increases due to genetic improvement were .6% between 1945-65 but this rate has now risen to 2% per year due to improved technology by the same public breeders and without P.V.R.
      </para>

       On the question of seed costs, the B.A.E. has failed to look at the evidence and has failed to analyse the Australian scene. Seed costs in the U.S.A. have risen faster than any other agricultural input. Between 1967 and 1978 seed prices in the United States doubled and then doubled again.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is precisely what will happen in Australia if the present Government is successful in putting this legislation into law. Mr Chatterton continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       The price of lucerne seed rose from $22 a sack to $111. This is a faster rate of increase than petroleum products. In Australia the cost to farmers is likely to be even greater than the cost to European or United States farmers. The reason for this is that to make the system work the Australian farmers will have to be forced, persuaded or conned into purchasing seed. Australia has an ideal climate for seed production and currently most farmers produce their own seed. In South Australia less than 4 per cent of the wheat crop is sown with purchased seed.

       In another part of the letter to the BAE-this is on page 11 of the report which I described earlier-this is Mr Chatterton's criticism:
      </para>
      <para>
       The author seems to have made a very selective review of the effect of P.V.R. on the seed market. A different viewpoint was recently put in a well known journal on international development policy (New Internationalist February 1982) .
      </para>
      <para>
       From a standing start in 1970 Shell Oil now markets seeds through at least 60 companies in Europe, North America, Latin America and Africa. It is by far the largest seed enterprise in the world. Close behind are two Swiss chemical twins Sandoz and Ciba-Giegy-with 22 and 30 companies respectively. Other European majors-none of whom appear to have been in the seed business a decade ago-are Sweden's Kema Nobel and Cardo; France's Elf Aquitaine and Rohne-Poulene, and Holland's Suike-Unie.
      </para>
      <para>
       'It appears more than 400 firms have been either brought up or chased out over the past decade.'
      </para>
      <para>
       Referring to page 18 of the report produced by the Department, Mr Chatterton continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       The author claims that P.V.R. 'is analogous to the present system of patent laws which encourage invention by private firms and individuals.' This is a false analogy and shows a fundamental lack of understanding about the nature of plant breeding. Plant breeders invent nothing. They merely rearrange the genetic combination of existing common property plants. They do not create anything that does not already exist in the common property gene pool. Even the so-called genetic engineering is only a rearrangement of a more fundamental level of genetics. What is being done by P.V.R. is the granting of exclusive private property rights to a public common property resource. Naturally there are huge windfall profits to be made from this transfer of property rights just as there were in the past with the enclosure of the grazing commons or the granting of fishing authorities. It is hardly surprising that private companies should mount such an expensive campaign to try to capture these windfall profits.
      </para>
      <para>
       I agree with that. I agree that the propaganda, or the so-called background papers produced by this Government, have all been aligned in a very biased way. It is quite surprising to see academics, mostly highly qualified people, producing information papers all biased in favour of the introduction of PVR legislation. No Government Department would do this unless it was being stood over by the Minister or by senior bureaucrats in the Department. In addition to that, they in turn have been stood over by the very people, companies such as Shell and others-I am not charging Shell with a takeover in Australia at present , although it will probably be highly interested-which have made this Government 's policy. I am surprised that Government senators are able to defend not the rights of the people of this country but the rights of the transnational organisations which want to control, with a handful of organisations, all the seed rights and everything else associated with agriculture.

       The Australian Consumers' Association is a highly respectable organisation, the publisher of Choice and well-known for its outspokeness in criticising not only matters of this nature but many of our manufacturers, retailers and others who dare to do the wrong thing by the consumer. I shall read from several parts of the Press statement issued by the ACA. The Press release is entitled 'Consumers abused under PVR'. It says:
      </para>
      <para>
       The rights to unique Australian flora-much of which has still to be named or discovered-could be lost to Australia overseas under the Federal Government's Plant Variety Rights Bill, the Australian Consumers' Association (ACA) has warned. The Association has stepped up its attack on the Bill, which is now before Parliament. In a major critique of the legislation--
      </para>
      <para>
       This was issued in April 1982-
      </para>
      <para>
       ACA has accused the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, of excessive secrecy and of abdicating his responsibilities to Parliament over plant varieties rights (PVR).
      </para>
      <para>
       It says there are no guarantees that PVR will be of any benefit to Australians. On the other hand, ACA says, the Bill will lead to:
      </para>
      <para>
       * Extra expense for consumers and farmers;
      </para>
      <para>
       * Abuse of consumer rights; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * A decline in public plant breeding programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Plant Variety Rights Bill would enable new varieties of plants or seeds to be patented, with royalties paid to the owners of the patent. The Bill has already been passed in the House of Representatives, despite widespread protests from consumer, conservation and horticulture and agriculture groups, and is scheduled for debate in the Senate this week.
      </para>
      <para>
       That was negated. It was held over to this session of Parliament. The Press release continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       On the threat to Australian flora, ACA says: 'This appears one of the worst aspects of PVR. Australian flora, much of which has yet to be named or discovered, could be patented under the legislation and hence potentially lost to overseas interests.'
      </para>
      <para>
       ACA criticises Mr Nixon for his refusal to release his department's report on the introduction of PVR.
      </para>
      <para>
       The association says one effect of the Bill will be a cut in government funds for agricultural research. Instead, it says, agriculture departments and other public bodies would be forced to patent new varieties in order to cover costs. This would mean consumers would pay twice for public research-once as taxpayers and again through royalties for patents. Farmers would pay three times if current levies were included.
      </para>
      <para>
       ACA says it is appalled that Mr Nixon has abdicated his responsibilities to Parliament over PVR by giving the Australian Agricultural Council all authority over what varieties can be covered.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Nixon had told Parliment that all discussions with the council were confidential and there would be no appeal against AAC decisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       That means if environmentalists or farmers disagree about a particular genus- for example, wheat-being registered, there is no accessible appeal,'' ACA says.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ACA has gone into great detail. It has analysed a number of aspects of the Bill. None of the analyses is favourable. One I want to quote relates to the protection of the public interest. The statement reads:
      </para>
      <para>
       The prime concern of ACA is the complete disregard for consumers in this Bill. There is undue power resting with the Australian Agricultural Council and the administrators of the Act with the lack of an adequate appeals system. There is no guarantee that PVR would increase the quality of Australian agriculture.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many months ago I asked a series of questions of the Minister. After a long period the replies came back. Most of them were impolite or polite evasions of the sense of the questions I placed on the Notice Paper. Others were virtually a repudiation of any information on particular matters. I agree with those who are critical that there has been undue secrecy. Pressures have been applied by people who have a vested interest in obtaining control of stocks of both plants and seeds in this country. I believe it will be in the best interests of those people-particularly consumers but also farmers, horticulturalists and others-who are now producing seeds and plants in a small or medium way to have the right to go before a public committee and state their case.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have long been interested in growing plants in a very small way as an amateur gardener. I am interested in developing varieties. It is a long, painful and tiring process to develop a variety that will reproduce true to stock. In some cases it takes many years. It is exhilarating to see a plant experiment come out the right way. We will not have that sort of right any more. At the moment if I want to develop something I do not have to ask somebody whether I can do it. I do not want to sell the plants. At the moment I am allowed to give them as gifts to my friends so that they too can enjoy the experience of seeing a new type of flower blooming in their gardens. Those who need to make a living from this do have the right to sell their produce, but they will find themselves in the same situation as small developers and small breeders. They will not exist after about 18 months or two years. They will totally disappear. The big combines, the big transnationals, will then wave the big stick. They will decide what we shall eat and what we can grow.
      </para>
      <para>
       The agricultural chemical companies are notorious for their development in this area in cases where they have had the opportunity to develop. Firstly, we must buy our seeds from them. The seeds are usually of poor quality and in some cases we probably would not be able to grow seed for the next crop so we have to go back and keep on buying their respective hybrids or whatever. Only they will be able to supply the right sort of fertiliser to look after their types of seeds. They will provide the pesticides to kill the moths and other bugs that get on to the plants they are selling. I think it will be a travesty if this legislation goes through. I hope we will get the opportunity to have it examined by the appropriate standing committee so that those people who are opposed to it and those who are in favour of it will be able to give their evidence in public and put up their case.

        —I have discussed with many groups the problems involved with plant variety rights legislation. I have discussed the matter with those who are in favour of it and those who are against it. After all the deliberations and discussions we have had, I must say that I have come down on the side which is in favour of plant variety rights. One reason is that I come from Tasmania, which is regarded almost as the vegetable garden for Australia. Tasmania is a significant producer of vegetables. Agriculture is terribly important not only to Australia's export economy but also to the total economy of Australia. To deny Australian agriculturalists the right to get the most up to date seeds available is to put Australian agriculture in a not very favourable position in relation to world trade.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I believe that in this field, as in the industrial field, we must keep up to date. One of the tragedies of some of our secondary industries is that we have not kept up to date with modern developments. All too often management has been a little too tardy. We had an example recently with the steel industry and, unfortunately, the implications for employment there have been rather devastating. Therefore, I think that in the interests of the Australian economy, and in the interests of keeping agriculture to the forefront by developing the species that are needed, we must vote in favour of this plant variety rights legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, having recognised that, I must acknowledge that to some extent that is something of a selfish approach because, while we in the developed countries introduce this sort of legislation to protect our farmers and benefits and to produce the best crops so that we can maximise returns and raise our own standards of living, we add to cost structures. The benefits for us exceed that, otherwise we would not go in for it or we would not plant these sorts of things and instead stick to the traditional sorts of seeds. This increasingly puts the Third World countries in a fairly difficult situation because it raises their cost structures. It puts out of court their ability to get the sorts of seeds which they possibly need more than we do. The balance between producing the food of the world and the utilisation of the needs of people for food is a very delicate balance. There are all the problems of political intervention, drought, floods and famine. These sort of things make it very difficult.
      </para>
      <para>
       From a humane point of view, I think the United Nations authorities and authorities such as that should devote some consideration to the impact that this sort of legislation-not only plant variety rights legislation but even patent rights legislation extending to industrial spheres-has on Third World countries. These are the areas with tremendous growth in population. Their needs are tremendous. They have tremendous difficulties. Therefore, I think that when we push through this legislation-I believe it is good for Australia-we should remember that it has world-wide implications. I believe we must give some sort of consideration to what we are going to do to those who are unable, for various reasons, to be able to get access to these sorts of seeds to feed their growing numbers. It is all very well to say that Australia, Canada and the United States of America will produce the grains to feed these people, but it is not as easy as that. In the Third World one can feed the indigenous population a lot easier if the food is grown by the people themselves because of the transport and political problems involved in getting food to such countries. I leave that matter for people's consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other factor I raise is that whenever we create a benefit as a result of legislation, which we are doing-we are creating a benefit for an identifiable group which develops a particular seed-inevitably we create a privilege for a group. Shortly after the PVR legislation was passed in the United Kingdom-within one week-either 74 or 84 seed companies or organisations were taken over by a very large group. I think we have to recognise that by passing legislation we will make that situation more attractive. I think that sometimes when we pass matters through the Senate we do not altogether realise the implications of the benefits and so on that we are passing on or denying. At the same time, this legislation has been around for a while. There has been a heck of a lot of discussion on it and a lot written about it. I doubt that by referring this matter to a standing committee of the Senate-I will be one of the senators sitting on that committee if the amendment is successful-we will add anything new to what is already known. As a lot of other speakers in this debate have said, this sort of legislation applies in most European countries, Japan, New Zealand and the United States.

        —The report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on cable television is an enormous document. I must indicate that anything I have to say does not stem from a profound knowledge of all the matters contained in that report. I want to make some preliminary observations by way of indicating the Opposition's attitude to the early introduction of cable television in Australia. The Opposition thinks that the inquiry into cable television was somewhat premature. In fact, this Government even found itself in the extraordinary situation, as a result of the decisions made by a former Minister for Communications, of having a number of inquiries all going at once into aspects of broadcasting and telecommunications policy, many of which were inconsistent, one with the other.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was asked to investigate the question of the introduction of cable television and radiated subscription television. The Davidson inquiry was asked to investigate the question of the privatisation of Telecom Australia. At the same time the satellite company AUSSAT was being set up with its own memorandum and articles of association which prescribed different functions. Of course, an inquiry was still going on at that stage into the Australian Broadcasting Commission. All of these things seem to us to be inconsistent, one with the other, and indicate appalling planning on behalf of the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       In connection with broadcasting policy the Opposition argues that what we need most is some consistency in the development of a system and some sense of direction about the development of the Australian broadcasting system. What is needed is some sort of orderly plan for development. There has certainly been no orderly plan for development enunciated by this Government in relation to the development of the broadcasting system and the communications system generally. What should have happened, of course, is that there should have been a general inquiry into the development of telecommunications in Australia not just a narrow inquiry into the privatisation of Telecom. If the Government had held a general inquiry into the future development of telecommunications then the question of the introduction of cable television might have been one of the terms of reference of such an inquiry.
      </para>
      <para>
       If there were an orderly investment of the broadcasting system in Australia we would be able to build on the existing public investment in broadcasting and telecommunications. It is an enormous investment. It is not only a public investment but also a private investment. That is the context in which the question of cable television should be considered. What we have in government policy at the moment in broadcasting and communications is a degree of spasticity, if I can use that word, in which certain limbs of the system are doing things which are totally unrelated or unconnected in any logical sense to other limbs of the system. That is a sort of tragedy in the sense of the investment which is involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to express a number of concerns and misgivings at this stage in relation to the early introduction of cable television in Australia. I want to itemise the misgivings of the Opposition. First of all, if one starts a cable television system in Australia one is talking about a very considerable investment whether that investment be by private enterprise or by government. The figures quoted for cabling the major capital cities in Australia vary from estimates of $3 billion down to $2 billion. The first question we have to ask is whether a country like Australia, which has a declining standard of living and an immense demand on resources, sees the development of cable television as a prime demand on available resources. The Opposition tends to argue that this is not so and that it is not a priority in terms of the use of resources in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the sad things is that a body such as the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is not asked to consider, and of course has not the competence or the expertise to consider, the whole question of priorities in terms of other political, economic and social priorities which a government has to address. So in going about its deliberations the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal looks with a fair degree of tunnel vision at the question which is before it; namely, whether cable television would be a good and exciting thing to introduce into Australia without looking at these other broad questions of priority.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first misgiving in respect of the report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on cable and radiated subscription television is whether the time is ripe in terms of social and economic circumstances for the early introduction of cable television in Australia. The second misgiving we have relates very much to the question of technology. There is an existing technology available in terms of the use of co-axial cables which would, presumably, be used if there were an early introduction of cable television. However, the technology of optical fibres is already well developed. It is considered generally throughout the rest of the world to be a superior technology for transmission of cable television. By 1985, 1986 or 1987 there will be, I think, widespread use of the superior technology of optical fibres wherever cable television is introduced. So if Australia were, before then, to embark on the introduction of cable television, what it would be doing would be introducing an already superseded technology.
      </para>

       If we look at the situation in Great Britain, British Telecom has told manufacturers of co-axial cable in Britain that they will have no more orders from British Telecom after 1985, that British Telecom will be moving to optical fibres after 1985. If we look at the experience in the United States, in Alaska there are already pilot schemes using optical fibre technology in existence. So it would be wasteful and spendthrift indeed for Australia, at this stage, to introduce a superseded technology with cable television. The appropriate time to do these things is probably when Telecom Australia comes to the stage of replacing its existing cables in ducts which, really, run to most of the houses in most of the cities of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other criticism we have of the report is the Tribunal's failure to reach a conclusion about the introduction of cable television and to distinguish between what engineers call the hardware-software separation; namely, that the best way for delivery of services is preferably to provide a system by a public authority , and to provide the information, the entertainment, the programming for that system from an alternative source. That is to say, the system itself should be separated from the source of the material that goes into it. The classic simple example of the software-hardware separation, of course, is the telephone. That is the most obvious example. The system is provided by a neutral authority; the use of the system is provided by input by various individuals and so on.
      </para>
      <para>
       The so-called hardware-software separation is of immense importance in developing systems of any kind. It is essential in our view, if we are to have an orderly development of the Australian broadcasting system, that that very fundamental distinction be recognised; that we have a provider of the system which carries the signals or the messages and a distinct and quite different provider of the material which goes on to the system. That is what we do with our existing television. It is what we should do with cable television as well. It is most important, I think, that those sorts of distinctions be recognised.
      </para>
      <para>
       Time eludes me. I merely wanted to indicate some preliminary misgivings and concerns about the technological romanticism which exists about the vast virtues of cable television. There are a number of points which I would be concerned to make which suggest that it would not be culturally desirable for this country to introduce a vast range of choice of television availability without adequate programming facilities to see that that choice is in fact a real one. We flag our concerns about this matter.

        —The Australian Democrats are opposed to the early introduction of cable television. We made a submission along those lines to the inquiry into cable television. We are very concerned about its early introduction for a variety of reasons. Some of those reasons were referred to by Senator Button. We believe that it would be enormously expensive to introduce. In looking at experience in overseas countries, such as the United States of America, it is very significant to note that cable television is hardly viable, even in cities such as New York and Los Angeles. In fact, it has not been nearly as popular as was first anticipated. If these sorts of cities are finding trouble in making cable television viable, the investment of billions of dollars to introduce it into cities such as Melbourne and Sydney-and I suggest they are the only two cities in Australia where it could be even considered-is very suspect. So we are opposed to it on the grounds of economic viability and the enormous capital expenditure involved. Our priorities for investment should be directed to much more urgent projects.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Again, there is concern by the Australian Democrats that there are competing technologies in this area. For instance, satellite technology certainly impinges on cable television and many of the advantages of cable television can be achieved, to some degree, by satellite technology. In addition, we as a party are very much in favour of the early introduction of radiated subscription television. If we are to have radiated subscription television, that will not be viable if we at the same time introduce cable television. We believe that radiated subscription television would give us high quality programs in certain areas. It would give us access to top line films on television sets which people would be prepared to pay for. It would give us additional television channels which could be used for educational purposes at off-peak viewing times and it would, by and large, be a very minor investment with some quite considerable advantages to the public at large.
      </para>
      <para>
       We cannot have radiated subscription television and cable television at the same time. We would say that a much more practical approach is first to introduce radiated subscription television and delay the introduction of cable television. We should delay it also for the very good reason, as Senator Button pointed out, that there is a great danger that the technology will overtake the existing co-axial cable approach that would have to be used if cable television were introduced at the moment. Fibre optics is the technology of the future. There is no doubt that within some years, although I query whether it will become common as quickly as Senator Button indicated, optic fibre technology will be with us, and if in five or 10 years time cable television were considered viable and needed to be introduced into our major cities at that time no doubt we would have a much more modern approach to its introduction so far as technology is concerned. For all these various reasons we feel very strongly as a party that the introduction of cable television should certainly be delayed but that it is reasonable for the matter to be kept under continual review.

         —I wish to refer to two comments in the Government's response. The inquiry was first undertaken in the previous Parliament and was again referred to the Committee by this Parliament. The Commonwealth inquired into petrol prices and petrol shortages in the Australian Capital Territory because at that time we were suffering from petrol shortages. Perhaps it is a little ironic that the situation exists again at present. As a result of discussions between the then Chairman of the Committee, the late Senator John Knight, and the then Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Ellicott, the terms of reference of the Committee were extended to inquire more broadly into the matter of energy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I refer to the Government's response in relation to petrol prices. Paragraph 97 of the report refers to the fact that in December 1980 the difference between Sydney and Canberra in the price of petrol was 4c a litre, the price being higher in Canberra. There was concern also about the price differential between Canberra and Queanbeyan. The oil companies gave varying explanations as to why prices were higher in Canberra. These explanations included matters such as the cost of transport. Of course, the cost of transport to Canberra is not dissimilar to that of Queanbeyan. One reason given for the difference of 2c a litre between Canberra and Queanbeyan was the fixed price of petrol in New South Wales. But that still left a differential of 2c a litre which the oil companies were not able to explain adequately to the satisfaction of the Committee which held the inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned about the apparent discrimination which exists concerning the price at which petrol is sold on a wholesale basis at the refineries. I believe the discrimination acts against the service stations which sell oil and petrol in the Australian Capital Territory. There has been no reasonable explanation from the oil companies as to their attitude in relation to the wholesale pricing of petrol. I would like to see the companies remove the discriminatory wholesale pricing arrangement and for them to give a better explanation as to why petrol costs so much more in Canberra than it does elsewhere. The real issue concerns the wholesale pricing of petrol. That concern is expressed in recommendation 6 of the Government's recommendations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recommendation 8 referred to the need to upgrade the railway link to Canberra, and the need for a service to enable people to travel more cheaply and to enable a development of the private sector in Canberra. A more viable rail service is required. The Government in its response said that the whole question of rail access to Canberra would be covered in the context of general proposals for upgrading transport links to the Australian Capital Territory. Whilst that is very encouraging it does not really tell us a great deal about when this will occur and the extent to which it is diligently being pursued. Without going into all the aspects of access to Canberra at this stage I would confine my comments to the report which specifically referred at paragraphs 139 and 140 to rail travel and quoted from a submission of the National Capital Development Commission. The report stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Freight movement to and within the ACT is performed mainly by truck transport- except for some specialised bulk commodities. It would be possible to make substantial economies . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The report referred in part to the need for rail transport in that regard. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard part of a submission of the Canberra Association for Regional Development. That Association has been working very hard towards developing the private sector in Canberra. It prepared a document entitled 'Regional Transport Communications'. Part of that document dealt with rail transport. I seek leave to have incorporated pages 8 and 9 of that document .

        6.1 The two main suggestions considered by CARD were:
       </para>
       <para>
        upgrading of line, rollingstock and service on the existing link through Queanbeyan to Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        the possible re-alignment of the main Sydney/Melbourne line with a 'T' spur to North Canberra with a later joining up with the existing Queanbeyan link.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.2 As with road communications, State/Federal/Territorial parochialism was evident in attitudes to the provision of improved facilities and services for the existing rail link.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.3 The existing arrangement, facilities and service are quite inadequate and it is difficult to imagine how anyone could seriously consider rail as other than a marginal contributor to transport communication in the Canberra/Queanbeyan area without major changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        'T' Link:
       </para>
       <para>
        6.4 The most imaginative solution as far as Canberra passenger traffic is concerned is the proposed 'T' link to the north.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.5 The Report by the National Committee of Railway Engineering to the Institution of Engineers, Australia, as a National Engineering Project for the Australian Bi-centennial summarizes the whole situation admirably:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''. . . the existing rail link to the National Capital is over a branch of a branch; it is heavily graded, tortuously curved and so roundabout that it is quite impracticable for Melbourne traffic (even a night sleeping car service was withdrawn many years ago). If the National Capital is to perform its function properly, first class transport links with other Australian cities are essential and overdue. In terms of rail links, neither the National Capital nor the State Capital cities to which it is connected should have to suffer the inadequacy of a branch of a branch line.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . in contrast, the new T-line would bring the main Hume Railway within 45km of Canberra via a similarly graded and curved 160 km/h single-track spur. A passenger terminus for the diesel highspeed trains is envisaged at North Canberra in the vicinity of the showground.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the inter-city bus system should desirably be linked with the proposed new terminus, from which spur lines could eventually give freight access to industrial areas such as Mitchell and Fyshwick.''
       </para>
       <para>
        6.6 It is quite clear that the development of the 'T' link would mean the passenger rail service to Sydney would be shortened to approximately 3 hours and the service to Melbourne approximately 6 1/2 hours. This would make rail quite competitive with any other means of transport for most travellers.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.7 If the 'T' line solution is accepted as the preferred option, the commitment to and planning of a proper connection to the existing Kingston/Fyshwick/ Queanbeyan line would be most important to provide the link to towns south of Queanbeyan and ensure existing and proposed freight terminals in South Canberra and Queanbeyan are properly utilized.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.8 As with the work on Air transport, there were a number of immediate issues which arose during CARD's investigation on Rail. The most interesting was the XPT train. Clearly during any period while the feasibility of the preferred 'T' solution is investigated, the service through Queanbeyan should be improved.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.9 As with Road finance CARD sees a need for the Federal Government to accept its Territorial responsibilities. CARD therefore believes that the Federal Government should contribute to the improvement to the existing link by providing funding for both line improvement and rolling stock.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.10 There appears justification for the provision of two XPT trains on the Sydney/Queanbeyan/Canberra link as a properly scheduled and administered service is necessary if realistic patronage is to be built up.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.11 Rail Recommendations:
       </para>
       <para>
        urgent consideration of the 'T' link suggestion, with the importance of the link to existing services highlighted.
       </para>
       <para>
        re-arrange financial arrangements between NSW/ Federal Governments to allow proper Territorial responsibility to be accepted on behalf of A.C.T.
       </para>
       <para>
        review of all freight rate and administrative arrangements in respect of the ' Border problem' to streamline administration and allow the existing service to be fully integrated into the NSW system.
       </para>
       <para>

        —This report is the epitaph of the Legislative Drafting Institute which was a victim of the murderous ravages of the razor gang . It is a sad occasion, essentially for the reasons I spelled out in a speech in this place on 10 June 1981 when the decision was announced. I do not propose to repeat the detail of what was said there, save only to say that I think that for a relatively small annual cost the Legislative Drafting Institute was developing a very great potential not only for drafting skills and the drafting profession in Australia but also as a vehicle for aid by Australia to overseas countries, aid which stood up very well in cost benefit terms.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The main function of the Drafting Institute since its establishment in 1975 has not been to train legal draftsmen-those who put our statutes and regulations together in Australia-because within this country that training is still largely done by way of an apprenticeship system, or a master and pupil system, within the respective offices of the Parliamentary Counsel. Rather the primary object of the Institute has been to train each year a dozen or so students brought from a variety of overseas countries in Asia, the Pacific area, the Caribbean and Africa. In fact, such courses were conducted every year from 1975 to 1981 with the exception of 1976. In all some 56 students from 25 countries have attended the Institute's courses. Very small sums have been involved-just a few hundred thousand dollars in toto-over the entire period. It does seem to be an absurd example of the Government cutting off its nose to spite its face in this desperate desire to economise or to take functions out of the public sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       The only other point I make about the report is that it was prepared pursuant to section 215 of the razor gang legislation which was more formally entitled the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981. In particular, the obligation imposed by that section upon the Attorney-General, being the responsible Minister, caused the report to be prepared as soon as practicable after the commencing day, the commencing day for this purpose being 9 December 1981. The point I make is that it has taken nine months to produce the present report which consists of exactly one page plus financial statments dealing with receipts and payments totalling for the period in question-the last months of the existence of the Institute from 1 July through to 8 December 1981-some $146, 000. I would suggest that this is yet another demonstration of that chronic lethargy and maladministration which has so afflicted the Attorney-General's Department in recent years and which has been the subject of so much adverse comment in this place in recent times.

        —I wish to confine my remarks to one of the three papers which we have before us, that is, the one which deals with South Australia. Senators from Queensland and Tasmania are present in the chamber and I guess that they will rise and address their remarks to these papers if they want to talk about how the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978 applies to their respective States. However, I am more concerned about South Australia. I notice that the supplementary agreement amends clause 10 of the principal agreement by omitting the words 'Adelaide water supply and treatment' and substituting the words 'water treatment and supply'. I guess that the purpose of the amendment to the agreement is to enable money provided by the Commonwealth to be used for the construction of a filtration plant near Morgan to supply the towns of Port Pirie, Port Augusta, Whyalla and Woomera.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I will not be very long in what I have to say. I point out that it took an election of the Whitlam Labor Government for something to be done about water treatment in South Australia. An agreement was reached between the Dunstan State Government and the Whitlam Federal Government to give a better water quality to the residents of Adelaide which is something that had been needed for many years . It was at our behest that the filtration plants were brought into being. I am a little disappointed that it has taken so long for all of the treatment plants to be completed. My colleague Senator Elstob said to me a while ago that he was wondering from where we would get the water if the present drought does not break very soon and particularly if we are not able to get more water from the Snowy Mountains. He wondered whether there would be any water to put through the treatment plants. Politicians cannot do anything to make it rain. Perhaps one day scientists will be able to do so but then I suppose they will be faced with the problem of stopping it because we have too much.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am pleased that the agreement is still being carried out. I notice that the agreement is the subject of the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978-Act No. 5 of 1978-which was assented to in March of that year. Of course at that time we still had a Labor Government in South Australia. Of course, as we all know, we will have another Labor Government in South Australia in March 1983. When the agreement comes up for amendment again it is quite possible it will be renegotiated by Federal and State Labor governments. We will have a change of government as soon as a Federal election is held and that is more evident as each day goes by in view of the way in which this Government is mismanaging the country. However, now that this Act is being amended, I hope that the present South Australian Liberal Government will get on with the job and stop a lot of the pussy-footing that we see. A lot of hot air comes out of the mouths of the Premier of South Australia and particularly Mr Arnold about what should be done to give us better water quality. Honourable senators well know that this has been a matter of great debate in this Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       We know, of course, that the new River Murray Waters Agreement has been signed. I asked a question the other day about when we were going to see the agreement tabled in the Parliament. Senator Carrick, the Minister responsible, assured me that it should not be too long before that the new agreement is tabled in the Parliament. I hope that, when this is done, we will see some better quality water coming over the border into South Australia. I am reminded that the water that came into South Australia last year because of the low flow of the Darling River was the best quality water we have had for years. That water came out of the Murray.

       Ministers may say-and Mr Arnold in particular has said so in recent times for political purposes-that the New South Wales Government was stealing South Australia's water. That is quite an erroneous statement because it is not so. South Australia was getting its fair share of water under that existing agreement. When the agreement was entered into to construct the Dartmouth dam, an ex-senator of this place who was then the Premier of South Australia never saw fit to have anything inserted in that agreement as to quality. All he was concerned about was quantity. We get, and we always have, our fair share of water. Most years we received more than our entitlement. However, we should be concerned that there will be a low flow in the river before the summer ends. We are already told that the mouth of the Murray is again silting in and the Murray will, as in recent years, again become just a pond. We cannot afford to open the mouth of the Murray by letting the water out because we would be letting good water go out to sea just to keep the Murray open. I think that this would be a tragedy for all people who use the Murray.

       One concern that has been expressed to me about the cost of constructing this filtration plant at Morgan is that a lot of water that will be filtered will be used for stock. That will be a waste of good filtered water. Neither the people of Murray Bridge, where I live, nor the people of Renmark, Berri, Barmera, Loxton and Waikerie get filtered water. They get their water straight out of the river and, although in some cases it is chlorinated, it is not filtered. The purpose of this amendment to the agreement is to allow money to be expended on the filtration plant at or near Morgan. However, when the plant is constructed a lot of the water that is filtered will be used for irrigating pastures or watering stock. I do not know how much research was carried out to see whether the filtration plant could not have been installed closer to the main centres of use-that is Port Pirie, Port Augusta and Whyalla. But we cannot do anything about this now because the Agreement has been signed and the Government of South Australia has made the decision-I am not quibbling about it-to construct the filtration plant at or near Morgan. I will not seek leave to continue my remarks because my State colleague Senator Jessop is almost certain to want to speak on this agreement.

        —I also comment on the National Waters Resources (Financial Assistance) Act. Unlike Senator McLaren I refer to Queensland also because I think in the overall context of our consideration of water resources in Australia we cannot ignore the fact that it is estimated that 22 per cent of the water that flows into the Murray each year comes from Queensland. Therefore, I do not think we can ignore that important aspect. It highlights my concern that a more aggressive national approach ought to be taken with respect to this important resource. I join Senator McLaren in welcoming this Act as it applies to South Australia. I lived at Port Augusta and know what the quality of the water happened to be in that area. I drank it for 15 1/2 years and sometimes I could hardly see through the glass of water that I was trying to drink. That happened frequently.

       This filtration system, extended to that part of South Australia, will be most welcome. That part of South Australia has also had problems with respect to amoebic meningitis. I know that the filtration is not a cure-all for that but at least it does enable the chlorination technology to be more effective. I think that should be welcomed also. I commend the previous State Labor Government on its initiative in introducing water filtration in South Australia. But I also think we should pay some compliment to the present State Government, which has seen the significance and importance of extending this system. I believe that the South Australian Government, in its national approach to water in Australia, ought to be commended because to my knowledge it is the first government that has supported the concept of a national approach. I think that point ought to be made and credit ought to be given to Peter Arnold who, as Minister for Water Resources in South Australia, has certainly come to grips with the problem and is giving a great amount of encouragement to the continuation of the work that was started many years ago.

       I join in welcoming this move and hope that the Federal Government will continue with the objective of establishing a national water resources system in Australia so that we can look after this important resource. I believe that, unless we do so by about the year 2019 or 2020, our water resources will be fully committed. Unless we do something more to examine the question of our artesian resource and to ensure that we do not mine the water, as is happening in some parts of the world, I think we will be in trouble and our national development program will slow down beyond that time, if not stop altogether.

        —This report gives little cause for optimism about the role and functions of the Trade Practices Commission under the present Government. The performance of the Government in winding back over a period the resources and capacity of the Commission to do the job which it was originally set up to do reminds one very much of the performance of the Government in relation to the whole tax avoidance and evasion area. It is an atmosphere in which punches are being pulled, in which there is much noise but little substance to back it up and little willingness to devote the kind of resources which are necessary if a regulatory body such as this is to be a useful and viable organisation. One suspects that the Government has been nobbled by business in this respect. It is not prepared to withdraw entirely from the trade practices regulation area because of the undoubted public relations difficulties in doing that. It has chosen instead to do it by stealth, leaving behind what is unfortunately looking more and more like an impotent shell.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is now eight years since the Murphy Trade Practices Act was introduced, changing as it did the face of restrictive trade practices and consumer protection law in this country. The retreat from the operation of the Commission as it was originally intended has been evident in two major respects. One is the steady clawback in the funding made available to the organisation. There is another 10 per cent real reduction evident in the staffing moneys available this year. The other is the way in which the most effective weapon that such a body can have-namely, the ability to litigate and to operate aggressively through the courts in relation to those breaching standards of the legislation-has also been wound back. This point was given much attention in last year's annual report, in particular in the supplementary comments of former Commissioner Pengilley, who described litigation as the essence of the credibility of the Trade Practices Act and pointed to the way in which an Act such as this is a paper tiger unless it is enforced-of course, that might be said about a number of areas of law that have been the subject of active discussion recently-and how the credibility of the legislation is fading fast as a result of the failure to follow through.
      </para>
      <para>
       The figures in this report, which were the subject of some discussion by Estimates Committee A yesterday, are really quite extraordinary. Out of some 22, 000 complaints, something like only four consumer protection cases were taken to court by the Commission in 1981-82. Out of something like 2,7000 complaints made to the Commission only one restrictive trade practices case was taken to court. In fact only a total of 14 cases have been taken to court over the past four years. Of course, the legislation can be used in other ways than by the Commission's initiating litigation or prosecutions. But if the Commission is to be the standard-bearer, as one would hope it would be in these areas, obviously it needs to be right in the forefront where these decisions matter most and where action matters most.
      </para>
      <para>
       A statement was made at the Estimates Committee hearing yesterday that it is hoped that some renewed emphasis can be given this financial year to the litigation role. But looking at the budgetary allocation for legal fees, on the assumption that not all of the work can be done in-house, it is not evident that that aspiration can be satisfied from the resources now available. There is one other quick thing I want to say about litigation and that is that it may be that the resource constraint is the crucial one. Nonetheless there are some rather odd, and I would think unsatisfactory, decisions being made by the Commission when faced with requests for it to take legal action.
      </para>
      <para>
       The one that has come most prominently to my attention is a request initiated by the Townsville regional conservation council in respect of Minatome Australia Pty Ltd, which operates the Ben Lomond uranium deposit-the exploratory work that is going on near Townsville. The conservation council has taken the position, based on reasonable evidence, that the Minatome corporation has in fact been guilty of false and misleading advertising within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act and action has been taken accordingly to try to get the Trade Practices Commission to prosecute for that breach. The reply that has been given by the Commission to that request, and indeed to myself, having made some representations on behalf of the conservation council, seems to me to reflect a rather curious appreciation of the Commission's role. The exercise is rejected by the Commission on two grounds, both relating to the proper terms of reference for the Commission's approach to the complaint.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission has rejected the complaint for reasons which I think are unsatisfactory in two ways. The first way they are unsatisfactory-I do not have the time to go into this in any detail-is that Mr Bannerman, speaking on behalf of the Commission, has seen or defined the central issue at stake in the proposed litigation as the question of the seriousness of any risk to the water supply of Townsville flowing from the Ben Lomond operations. However, the issue which I think is appropriate for the Commission to draw its attention to is not the substantive merits underlying the particular application but rather the much more immediate legal question as to whether the Minatome corporation has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct or advertising in relation to the work it is doing and the implications of that work.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second ground for concern about the Commission's response is its assertion that it would not be appropriate for the Commission to bring proceedings at public expense as this would simply involve applying counter-pressure in a battle between a conservation council and a corporation, and that such a political exercise could be better engaged in by the Council's making appropriate representations to the Queensland Government, the likely outcome of which we can readily anticipate.
      </para>
      <para>
       My point, and indeed that made by the Conservation Council, is that this sort of response would seem to misconceive the role of the Commission in relation to complaints of this kind. It may be that the response of Mr Bannerman and the Commission is perfectly understandable given the constraints of scarce resources and their simply having to find grounds, any grounds, however irrelevant to the basic purposes of the Act as originally framed, to justify their failure to take action to intervene and to initiate prosecutions in this area. But if that is so and if, as I believe, spurious grounds are being taken to justify non-action of this kind that is because of a resource constraint, that is but another demonstration of the unhappy condition to which the Commission has been reduced by the Government's failure to fund.
      </para>
      <para>
       My final point relates to a number of recommendations in the report as to changes to the legislation to cope with various suggestions for change that have been made or have emerged from the experience of the Commission. One matter that again deserves more attention than I can give it during these brief remarks is the time constraint which presently exists on prosecutions launched by the Commission. Under section 21 (1) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, where no term of imprisonment is specified for the particular offence, a prosecution may be commenced only within a specified period-six months or 12 months as the case may be. The difficulty, as has been apparent in recent times, is that the removal of gaol terms from the kinds of penalties that may be imposed for breaches of the Trade Practices Act has had the incidental effect of requiring all classes of prosecution to be commenced within 12 months of the facts, to which the events gave rise, occurring.

        —I wish to say a few words on the Trade Practices Commission report because it is a tragedy that, upon the Parliament receiving a report of this nature, honourable senators should be limited to making a short 10-minute contribution concerning it. The Trade Practices Act came into force eight years ago, almost to the day. It had as its purpose strengthening the competitiveness of private enterprise at the various levels of production and distribution. It was also designed, in that process, to strengthen the position of, and benefit, consumers and deal with unethical practices that had been brought to the attention of the Parliament. In other words, the purpose of the legislation was to show that there was an ugly face to business and that legislative action was required to remedy the position.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       However, this Government, largely as a result of the activities of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, or razor gang, has seen fit to reduce the effectiveness of this organisation to an alarming degree. That is seen in what has happened to its staff ceiling since July 1975. There has since been an effective reduction, in the 226 personnel employed by the Commission, of 25 per cent, to a figure of 161. The Government, in denying the Commission staff and financial resources, in making its effective work subject to the day-to-day direction of the Minister, and in making ministerial rearrangements that took place earlier this year-in the course of which the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs was abolished and its functions transferred to the Attorney- General's Department-gives a clear indication of its lack of concern. Now the Commonwealth Government is the only government in Australia that has not an active consumer affairs department such as is present in all of the States. An attempt is made to suggest that these matters should be dealt with by State administrations. Also, the razor gang abolished the Trade Practices Consultative Committee, which performed a very important function in not only protecting the interests of consumers but also providing consultation and advice for the important small business and primary industry sections of the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further indication of the downgrading of the work of the Commission is given by the Government's action in placing it under the day-to-day attention of the Minister and reducing its effective role of monitoring advertising and business practices, matters clearly requiring Commonwealth jurisdiction. The report also refers with some trepidation to the freedom of information legislation. I can only hope that the Commission remains true to its commitment to give liberal effect of the Parliament's policy of invoking to the least possible extent the exemptions in the freedom of information legislation. The report continues at some length to explain the effects of the razor gang's actions on consumer protection and what this has done to render ineffective that function of the Commission. The report continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       One effect of the direction-
      </para>
      <para>
       That is, of the Minister-
      </para>
      <para>
       is the inability of the TPC to take the first initiative in investigation, being dependent instead on a matter being brought to its attention by an external source. This has for example prevented the TPC from monitoring national advertising to see whether, on its face, it contravenes the Act or requires some investigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the Ministerial Direction the TPC has required, until recently, that each complaint be submitted to it by staff for approval to carry out any investigation at all, thus exercising very tight control . . . This very tight control has meant that some matters have necessarily come to the TPC inadequately developed and with too little information. In addition contact with the company complained of may itself result in resolution of the complaint. The TPC has now delegated to senior staff the power to seek the company's comments on the complaint.
      </para>
      <para>
       I invite honourable senators to look at the complaints that are listed. They concern sales of motor vehicles such as we read of in the popular Press. Also, there have been a number of false advertisements relating to fuel saving devices . We live in a time when some consciousness is developing about the necessity to conserve fuel, so there have been unscrupulous practices by manufacturers designed to fool purchasers. Again, we have read in the popular Press of a number of cases of airline overbookings and what distress that has caused airline travellers. Reference is in the report also to a number of false and misleading advertisements about residential land. People save for the purpose of providing themselves with accommodation only to find that they are caught by land sharks. In the report that is repeatedly brought to the attention of the Parliament.
      </para>

       The report also contains evidence of retail malpractices on the part of even such prominent companies as Waltons Ltd, which on two occasions has been fined for misleading advertising in respect of furniture.

         —In general the Australian Broadcasting Commission provides an excellent news service for Australian people. However, on rare occasions it falls short of providing this excellent service and when this happens it should be mildly chastised. I intend to issue a rebuke to the ABC because of the matter I am raising this evening. On the noon radio news service on 10 September, last Friday, the following news item was issued by the ABC:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The ACT is challenging Darwin's claim to have the highest beer consumption in Australia, but from a totally different angle. Canberrans are the heaviest consumers of milk in Australia. According to figures from the milk authority they down 120.2 litres a year, compared to the Australian average of 107.5. The figures for the financial year for 81/82 show a steadily increasing demand for milk in the ACT compared with the 1980/81 sales figure of 113 litres a head, perhaps surprisingly tropical Queensland has the second biggest milk consumption average of 116.7 litres a head and Victoria is third with 115.1 litres.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a fairly straightforward news item. Perhaps it is not as exciting as excerpts from the report of the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, but it is straightforward nonetheless. However, an hour later the story was changed a little. This was the item read by the newscaster on the 1 p.m. ABC radio news service:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the category of 'we're not too sure what it means' comes the news that people in Canberra are the heaviest consumers of milk in Australia. According to figures from the milk authority, Canberra's average consumption per person is 120 litres a year, compared to the national average of 107. Canberra has a big population of public servants.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the newscaster was not too sure what it meant I am not too sure what the newscaster meant by that particular comment. What does it mean? Does it mean that public servants drink a lot of milk because they have endless cups of tea? Perhaps it refers to the fat cats in the Public Service who need plenty of milk. I am not sure what was meant by that news item. It is not the standard of news reporting that we normally associate with the ABC. If the ABC wants a second- rate reputation that is the way to go about it. There is a more likely explanation of why the milk consumption in the Australian Capital Territory is higher than the national average. That explanation is that Canberra has a young population. If it has a younger population than the national average it might be that such a population has a high milk consumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        I had a look at some of the figures for the population distribution in the Australian Capital Territory by age and I noted that the under five years age group comprises 9.3 per cent of the Territory's population. This compares with the Australian average of 7.6 per cent. So in general there is a younger population, according to figures on that age group, in the Australian Capital Territory. So it will not be thought that I picked just one age group I refer to two other groups. The under 10 years age group comprises 19.5 per cent of the population of the Australian Capital Territory compared with the Australian average of 16.1 per cent. The under 16 years group comprises 30.9 per cent of the population of the Australian Capital Territory, compared with the Australian average of 26.6 per cent. So in general it appears that the Territory population is younger than the Australian average. That could explain why milk consumption in the Australian Capital Territory is higher than the Australian average. It is probably not the only explanation but it is certainly a better explanation than the ironic humour attempted by the ABC.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) A number of research companies have been engaged by the Special Broadcasting Service to obtain preliminary assessments of the multicultural television service. These companies were: McNair Anderson Associates Pty Ltd, Sydney; Inview Market Research, Melbourne; Tavistock Research Centre Pty Ltd, Sydney; and Spectrum Research, Sydney. Both quantitative measurement and qualitative audience reaction studies have been carried out, together with surveys of reception difficulties in Sydney. A comprehensive study to follow the 15 month establishment period of the service was conducted by McNair Anderson during January and February 1982. Aspects of multicultural television which were investigated include:
      </para>
      <para>
       the level of public support for the concept of a multicultural television service;
      </para>
      <para>
       opinions by audiences on whether multicultural television is achieving its aims ;
      </para>
      <para>
       the size of the audience to multicultural television;
      </para>
      <para>
       the views of audiences on the standard of programs presented;
      </para>
      <para>
       general likes/dislikes of the service;
      </para>
      <para>
       audience reaction to subtitled programs, etc.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Most of the studies conducted have not been available to the public but a comprehensive summary of the findings of the January/February 1982 study have now been published and circulated publicly.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Institute of Multicultural Affairs conducted its own assessment survey, to which the Special Broadcasting Service has made financial contribution. Results of the survey were published in the Institute's 'Evaluation of Post Arrival Programs and Services'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. The significant results from surveys to date illustrate that the most popular programs of the service are news, current affairs and feature films. A special analysis of each survey during 1981 has shown that the average number of people who view multicultural television each week is 305,000 in Sydney, and 368 ,000 in Melbourne. A special survey conducted by McNair Anderson in early 1982 ( referred to in (1) above) indicates that a total of 935,000 people viewed multicultural television in that city during the four week survey period.
      </para>
      <para>
       Assuming a proportionate Sydney performance to the average weekly figures throughout 1981 as shown above, the Special Broadcasting Service considers that it could be estimated that approximately 1,700,000 people viewed multicultural television in Sydney and Melbourne during the four week period.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) It is considered by the Special Broadcasting Service that there are special difficulties in measuring two of the several core audiences of multicultural television-namely, ethnic audiences of limited or no command of English, audiences in the upper income groups. It is possible that some understatement of audiences to multicultural television therefore occurs in standard industry surveys.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) No quantitative surveys have been carried out with other organisations, and the Special Broadcasting Service is of the opinion that comment cannot therefore be made on other survey results.
      </para>
      <para>
       The regular station 'share' figures shown in the McNair Anderson industry reports, and frequently quoted in the Press, (usually in the order of 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent) are considered by the Special Broadcasting Service to be inadequate audience performance criteria for the evaluation of multicultural television, as they do not illustrate the size of the audience reached. They are used mainly by commercial stations in recognition of a need for a simple competitive index. As such, station 'share' figures illustrate comparative station performances in terms of their individual shares of total viewing time given by audiences to all television stations in each market.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Special Broadcasting Service considers that the performance of multicultural television should also not be assessed on a quarter hour by quarter hour rating basis as required by commercial stations for advertising sales purposes. Multicultural television is able to use all quarter hours during which it is on air to achieve its multicultural aims. Its total reach of audience during the period of its transmissions is therefore of prime importance .
      </para>
      <para>
       In this connection it is the opinion of the Special Broadcasting Service that the standard industry surveys in Melbourne throughout 1981 show an average of 17 per cent of Melbourne homes tuned in to multicultural television each week and that the recent survey in January/February 1982 indicates that this figure rises to approximately 43 per cent in Melbourne over a four week period.

Proposals to that end are currently under examination by the Public Service Board. Under these proposals the Trade Practices and Consumer Affairs Division will remain intact; some of the staff of that Division are lawyers. The Companies and Securities Branch of the Corporate Affairs Division is to remain largely intact and to be integrated into the Business Affairs Division where related legal functions were already being performed. Some staff of this Branch will continue to occupy clerical/ administrative positions while others, who are legally qualified, will have their positions translated to the legal/professional equivalents. A few project and accounting positions in the Companies and Securities Branch are to be integrated with similar work in the Management and Special Services Division. The Bankruptcy Branch of the Corporate Affairs Division, which is predominantly staffed by people with accounting qualifications, is to be transferred, except for one position, to the Management and Special Services Division. The Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Office is to remain intact and to report directly to the Secretary of the Department.

       (4) The licences have been renewed annually in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed between the Guild and the Australian Government and set out in the annual agreements. The Guild has nominated KKFC Pty Ltd as its Australian representative. The agreements were negotiated in order to establish controls over Taiwanese fishing activities which had been undertaken in the area for a number of years prior to commencement of the Australian fishing zone in November 1979.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's policy is to give preference to Australians and Australians in partnership with foreign interests over bilateral agreements such as the agreement with the Guild. A number of joint feasibility fishing ventures were approved in 1978 for trawling on the north west shelf involving Japanese and Korean vessels. These projects were not successful and at present the only foreign trawlers and gillnetters operating in northern waters are Taiwanese vessels licensed under the agreement with the Guild.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth is, however, prepared to consider on their merits new proposals involving Australian and/or foreign fishing interests operating in these waters. Indeed, as indicated, a number of new joint venture proposals involving Australians in association with foreign fishing interests are under active consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) and (6) The full nature and extent of the goods or services provided by KKFC and the fees paid for those services by the Guild are matters for commercial agreement between the parties concerned.

      <para>
       FMC Chains Pty Ltd wrote to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs on 6 May 1982 requesting that an import duty of 120 per cent be levied against imports of stud link chain.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce responded to the Company's letter on 8 June 1982.

      <para>
       In the interim, a senior officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce telephoned the National Sales Manager of FMC Chains on 21 May 1982 and advised of the procedures to be followed by Australian manufacturers seeking an increase in assistance against imports. The firm was also advised that assistance for stud link chain had recently been reviewed by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on Products of the Forgoing, Foundry, Die Casting, Sheet Metal Industries and Other Fabricated Metal Products. The Government's decision on that report is expected to be announced shortly.
      </para>
      <para>
       Copies of the standard questionnaire used by the Department of Industry and Commerce in ascertaining whether a prima facie case of damage from imports exists were forwarded to FMCM Chains Pty Ltd on 21 May 1982, and representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce in Canberra on 1 June 1982 to discuss the problems facing the company.
      </para>
      <para>
       FMC Chains has not yet returned the completed questionnaire to the Department and until such time as the requested information has been supplied a detailed examination of the firm's request for assistance cannot be undertaken.

      <para>
       (1) Karumba field station was originally established to enable scientists studying the banana prawn to work there for extended periods in the wet season, which is an important phase of the prawn's life cycle.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) After three or four years of field work, time was needed to analyse and interpret the results and scientists left Karumba in 1979. As a result of their findings, the banana prawn catch can now be predicted each season with some confidence on the basis of rainfall records.
      </para>
      <para>
       Field work on norther prawns resumed in 1981, but the emphasis is now on the tiger prawn, which has become the principal component of the catch. Karumba is well away from the main tiger prawn area, and some of its buildings are being used to establish a new field station at Groote Eylandt, which is the centre of the tiger prawn industry. CSIRO is puting increased effort into prawn research, with support from the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account.
      </para>
      <para>
       Struggles to survive in the northern prawn industry are largely due to economic factors including fuel and operating cost increases, not to a decline in total catch.
