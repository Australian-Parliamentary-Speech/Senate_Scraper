      <para>
       (4) the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia has been seeking a Royal Commission for well over two years to ensure an independent investigation of these matters.

       Commonwealth Home Loans

      </para>
      <para>
       (1) That in 1964 a Liberal/Country Party Government granted Mr Anthony M.P. a Commonwealth Government Home Loan Mortgage of $17,964 for a period of 45 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.75% and that at 1.9.82 the amount of principal had only been reduced by $3,354.06, since 1.10.81 leaving a balance of $14,609.94.
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14% of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.

       The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.

       Aircraft Manufacturing Industry

      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Aircraft Manufacturing Industry has suffered serious setbacks since its creation, because of the lack of a coherent Australian Government Policy for the Industry, as illustrated by:-
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Reduction in R.A.A.F. flying hours.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Cut backs in the Grumman Tracker.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Delay in the introduction of new tactical fighter.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Delay in the introduction of the trainer project.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) Cut back on the production of the Nomad aircraft from 200 to 170.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will further destabilise the industry and many jobs and vital skills will be lost.
      </para>
      <para>
       We deplore the Government's decision to proceed with the proposed retrenchments and by so doing ignore the resolution passed unanimously by the Senate ''That no compulsory retrenchments of employees should take place until both houses of Parliament have debated the joint committee's report on this reference.''
      </para>
      <para>
       The decision to go ahead with retrenchments has been made without proper consultation with employees and unions in the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your Petitioners therefore, humbly pray that the Government will reverse its recent decision to retrench initially 38 employees, followed by further retrenchments in the new year, until both houses of Parliament have considered the finding of the present Senate inquiry into Defence matters.

       3. That the States and Territories were granted a total of only $2.2 million for an urgent program of works that is awaiting at least $20m to complete and that most of these projects will be in ruins before enough money is available.

      <para>

        My question is: Since when in the history of modern warfare have bombs been classified as not being sharp end offensive weapons? Will the Prime Minister take control of this absurd situation and give an assurance that Australia will not trade in offensive weapons, as that term is generally understood by everyone except Mr Viner, particularly not with military dictatorships such as that of the Philippines where such weapons are likely to be used against those seeking a just, fair and equitable social and economic system? In short, will the Prime Minister ensure that the Minister for Defence Support does not go on a frolic of his own throughout South East Asia selling bombs?

Having agreed with Senator Reid, if the Teachers Federation is going to draw attention to one country whose practices it finds less than satisfactory, it should also be even-handed across the board. The honourable senator mentioned the Soviet bloc and the Baltic States people. Of course, it is entirely proper that she should do so. I understand that South Africa has diplomatic relations with Australia and that its Ambassador is in good standing here. I assume that he would be treated with all due courtesy by Australians because of that fact. It is, of course, free for any person to decide whether he or she will choose to have social contact with any person or any group in Australia, but I think that should be done with due regard to diplomatic courtesy. The honourable senator does well to draw our attention to the provisions of the Vienna convention in this matter.

The Chairman of the appeal committee, Mr Reuben Scarf, recently reported that since the time of the official launching $190,000 has been raised. He is confident that by the time the appeal officially closes in late December over $200,000 will have been raised. Funds raised by the appeal have not yet been distributed in Lebanon. The appeal committee is assessing needs and recommending ways in which the appeal funds can most effectively be spent in order to help the greatest number of people. I think the Senate would be aware of the rapidly changing situation in Lebanon which makes such assessment difficult. The Government is confident that the appeal will distribute its relief assistance fairly and efficiently.

The Government has been assured that the Committee is working to this end in association with the Lebanese Government and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The major religious faiths of Lebanon are represented on the appeal committee. In the Government's view the Australian Aid for Lebanon Committee appeal represents an effort by responsible individuals in the Australian Lebanese community to help to meet the need for relief assistance. I note that Senator Chipp is concerned that this aid money may not yet have been distributed. I will see whether any action can be taken, particularly as the appeal closes very shortly, so that is is expedited and distributed as soon as possible.

It could be argued that one section of the company which is not profitable could be subsidised in a general sense by other more profitable sections. But I think we need to take into account the demand for steel on the world or domestic markets at present and perhaps the somewhat more limited range of options that may be open to any company including a company such as BHP. I will forward Senator Bonner's question to the Ministers concerned and see whether there is any response which they wish to make. I think that ultimately many decisions taken commercially by our corporations are decisions which rest within their own jurisdiction. Whilst we may regret changes in employment opportunities, very often the Government is not able to take active participation in such decisions.

The fact is that, instead of our being brought into disrepute by our actions, the Committee has done the very reverse. The Committee has listed South West Tasmania in the knowledge that one of the factors involved is that the State Government proposes to build a dam. In fact, the listing has occurred on that basis. The many Jeremiahs who said that it would not occur have been proved wrong.

         â€”It really does not help to have Senator Ryan ask this question in the way she has. The support of non-government schools by the Commonwealth extends to all schools which are registered in the States and Territories. In order to ensure that we are giving our money and our support through recurrent funding to schools which are appropriate there has been a requirement that the schools be registered by the appropriate State or Territory . The requirement that any school be registered is one that extends across Australia. The fact that the school to which Senator Ryan referred, Yipirinya school in Alice Springs, has not been able to obtain registration from the Northern Territory Government is a matter which needs to be resolved between the school and the Government. We stand ready with funds for recurrent support of the school when it is registered. It will get its funds when it is registered, like all other non-government schools. Senator Ryan is suggesting that for some sections of the community registration should not be necessary.

In view of the disgusting gerrymander and malapportionment of Western Australian State electoral boundaries, and State laws which have institutionalised barriers to enfranchisement, will the Commonwealth use its foreign affairs powers under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in order to achieve electoral justice in Western Australia, or if this course is repugnant to the Government, will the Liberal Party bring moral pressure to bear on its Western Australian branch to adopt democratic principles of one vote one value and universal suffrage as espoused by the Covenant?

Let me simply say a couple of things: The Commonwealth Government has under survey the whole of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. We hope that we will be able to bring amendments to the Act into this place in the autumn session. The Government would reject gerrymander by any political party. The two most outrageous gerrymanders ever committed in Australia were, firstly, that maintained by a Western Australian Labor government over the years where electorates had a few hundred people, if that, and, secondly, that instituted by a Queensland Labor government.

         â€”Honourable senators opposite can shout, but I will give this answer. The next part of Senator Giles's question becomes extremely embarrassing for members of the Labor Party; so they try to distract the Senate by interjecting. The Labor Party senator asks whether the Federal Government will use its foreign affairs powers to intervene in State laws-to override State laws to alter the electoral laws and to alter the boundaries. In other words, there is an advocacy by the Labor Party of an intervention using foreign affairs and centralist socialist powers to destroy the State governments. Yesterday I made the point that if there is one thing that the Labor Party does not want exposed in Australia today it is its terrible mistake, in fact, its lethal mistake-it was a mortal wound to the Labor Party-when it decided that it was willing to use foreign affairs powers to override State sovereignties. It was willing not only to seize property in the States but also to tell the States whether they would have industries and what they would do. Now the advocacy is that the Labor Party is to tell the States that they do not have the power to make electoral laws, that the Commonwealth will make electoral laws. This is the same Labor Party that had the worst gerrymanders in Australia's history in Western Australia and Queensland. It is important to understand that what was called the Murphy law, when former Senator Lionel Murphy was here-that is, the Labor intention to use foreign affairs powers to destroy the States-is becoming more and more exposed. I am grateful for the question.

         â€”It is undoubtedly true that the extension of rights to appeal against administrative decisions is complicating both the administration and the law in Australia. Many honourable senators have, of course, taken a very active interest in the extension of citizens' rights. As in all changes there are, of course, both advantages and disadvantages. The honourable senator in drawing attention to the complexity of this area has pointed to what we might regard as some of the more untoward or unfortunate effects of changes which basically have been made to protect the rights of individuals against peremptory administrative action. The matter is one which I think is of some complexity. It involves both the responsibilities of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I will see that the question is referred to them. I will also refer to the Acting Attorney-General for his consideration the particular point about the possibility of a simpler appeals mechanism.

I ask him whether he is aware that both those minority reports called for the retention of the factory, further exploitation of its capacity, increases in its capacity in respect to the manufacture of 500 lb bombs which, by any definition, are of a sharp point, and the further manufacture of guns. The minority reports stated that this extra capacity would be maintained as a result of the sale of that equipment-those bombs and those guns-to South East Asia.

The point that Senator Crichton-Browne makes is a very important one. It is the objective of the Department of Defence Support to increase Australia's capacity to defend itself. To some extent fulfilment of that objective may rely upon the expansion of markets overseas. But, naturally enough, all factors would need to be taken into account in the negotiations of sales contracts in respect of strategic materials such as those outlined by Senator Crichton-Browne.

As far as the obligations of overseas companies are concerned, I think it needs to be remembered that the obligations of employers generally have to be seen in the light of the fact that, if labour cannot be profitably employed, it is not possible to employ labour. I make no judgment on the position with respect to Utah. I do not have any facts before me. Certainly, one would hope that all employers would exercise a responsible attitude with respect to maintaining people in employment as far as is possible. I simply make the side point that it is essential that if we are to maintain private employment in Australia-private employment is, of course, the bulk of employment-we should maintain also the profitability of Australian industry. That has implications for actions by trade unions as well as by management and company ownership.

The report makes only one mention of industrial disputation, that is, a loss of revenue of approximately $3.5m due to industrial action. I ask: Is it a fact that consideration is currently being given to the withdrawal from service or, in any event, major reductions in the service of the Indian Pacific, one of the last long distance passenger trains in the world and a popular international attraction? Is it a fact that the 9 per cent reduction in passenger traffic mentioned in this report is due to inefficiency in marketing of the product and the fact that passengers are frequently informed that no seats are available on the Indian Pacific when, in fact, the train leaves the station half empty due to over-allocation of block bookings to travel agents? Is it a fact that 152 train journeys were cancelled between March 1979 and 5 December 1982 due to industrial action? Finally, I ask the Minister whether the new Ghan is being exposed to difficulties similar to those being imposed on the Indian Pacific railway by industrial disputation and inefficiency.

However, on the general question of the problems presented by industrial disputation-he drew our attention specifically to those confronting the Indian Pacific railway service-I make the point that in recent times there has been considerable disputation that would not have been covered by the Australian National Railways Commission report to which he refers . There was, of course, virtually a total shut-down of ANRC operations until about a week ago. I understand that the Indian Pacific railway is still out of action due to the activities of the South Australian branch of the Australian Railways Union. Consequently, that railway is not operating at present and there will be a considerable drop in transport and passenger revenue as a result. I did note in the ANRC report the references to marketing problems. I will seek specific information from the Minister on those matters and will direct his attention to Senator Lewis's suggestions in that regard.

The fact is that what I have said is that the Federal Labor Party, both in the period of the Whitlam Government and now, is seeking to abuse the Federal treaty powers and the foreign affairs powers. It is seeking to make a much wider use of them than even the courts themselves have said is warranted. I remember Senator Lionel Murphy standing here and arguing that what it should do was use them as widely as possible and then let anyone who wished to do so come along and challenge them. The fact is that it is not a question of preventing iniquitious State laws . Let us not forget that in Western Australia a Labor government had created a Labor gerrymander and another Labor government was being asked to intervene. That, in itself, is absolute nonsense. As I understand it, it is not the intention of the Federal Government to change its mind on the question of the Racial Discrimination Act. The High Court decision in that regard will of course be interesting and will be studied. The real point is that the Fraser Government would not intervene to take over electoral laws in Western Australia or elsewhere. It would not intervene to force itself upon States and destroy their sovereignty. It would use its powers in the most discreet and careful way possible and it would respect, as far as it is humanely possible, the sovereignty of the federal system.

Yesterday an international committee of great prestige recognised the national status of Australia, paid tribute to it and accepted the Federal Government's application to have a wilderness listed on the World Heritage List. The difference between the Liberal and Labor parties is that we do it in the liberal way. The Labor Party would use the bulldozer of very dubious Federal powers to destroy the States. It would say to the Tasmanian Government: 'You have no right to make your own determination even though the people, through the ballot box in a referendum and a State election, believed they had the right to elect a government to make a decision about a dam and led you to believe that you had the right to make that decision and even though 33 of the 35 members of the State Parliament including the Labor Party, voted for the decision'. If the Labor Party does not believe in State sovereignty why does it not repeat to the States the advice Mr Whitlam gave them? He said about the best thing State members of Parliament could do in the interests of Labor socialism was to destroy themselves. That is on record in a speech written by Mr Whitlam. Incidently, the Labor Party is seeking to achieve the same result indirectly by the brutal use of power, and no reponsible government will ever let it do that.

It is the only real river system of any size and consequence and, of course, it feeds through three main States and is vital to them. For those who talk about damming it, let me say that it was a Liberal government which recently brought about the River Murray Waters Agreement, which aims to preserve the environment of the River Murray by insisting on the upgrading of the quality as well as the quantity of water and by insisting on proper environmental controls along the length and breadth of the Murray-Darling system.

        If one were looking for further examples of the conservation measures of the Federal Government, one could look at the River Murray. But in a continuous and aggravated drought the River Murray could become endangered. It is only because of the building of the Dartmouth Dam-I heard some people were opposed to the dam -that we had the capacity, because it was 70 per cent full a few months ago, to put a flush down the river through the Hume Reservoir to keep the salinity level relatively low. Had the Dartmouth Dam not been built, today the River Murray would be in danger.

         â€”Probably today the honourable senator would be one of those who would not allow the Snowy Mountains Scheme to go ahead. The Kosciusko National Park is a great national resource and a great wilderness. Indeed, the wilderness itself has been managed and preserved, despite the building of a hydro-electric system in the park. If that had not been built the supply of electricity to New South Wales and Victoria would not exist today and the River Murray's salinity would be causing problems. It so happens that because of the Dartmouth Dam in particular, and because of anti-salinity practices, we have lower salinity levels that we might otherwise have had. I had not thought that the River Murray might be listed on the World Heritage List. I will see whether such a diverse scheme over such a diverse area could be listed. I will seek advice from the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment on the matter.

An Australia-Indonesia symposium arranged by the Department of Foreign Affairs was held in Canberra in 1979. The recent symposium provided an opportunity for expert and interested people, both officials and non-officials, to review matters of international and regional interest that affect the two countries. The Australian delegation considered the symposium to be most successful. As the delegation has only just returned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs expects to receive a report in due course. He does not wish to comment on Press items until he has had a full report from the delegation. The questions raised by Senator Teague, in a more general sense, can await the response that the Minister will make after he has had a report from the delegation.

       <para>
        At a dinner in Manila in honour of the visiting Australian Defence Minister, Mr Sinclair, on 2 August, the Philippine Defence Minister, Mr Enrile, made the following remarks on Australian aid to the Philippines, according to the text provided to our Embassy in Manila:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''The historical bond between your country and ours, our shared democratic ideals, and the confluence of our individual concern for regional and international security and stability, our quest for peace have combined to accelerate the remarkable growth in the programs of cooperation between Australia and this nation, the Republic of the Philippines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increasing contribution of Australia to regional and world security is a development that is welcomed by the Philippines as a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, since ASEAN is at the forefront of preserving and promoting the peace and stability of our Asia-Pacific region.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of special importance to us in the region, of course, is Australia's intensified participation in regional economic development which is a vital component of security and stability. The Philippines regards itself as fortunate in working closely with the Australian Government and its people in development programs in the Philippines which are aimed at the development of some of our rural areas-Zamboanga, Samar especially. And these are directed in those places where we continue to face pockets of insurgency.
       </para>
       <para>
        These programs, I must say, have proven to be very effective in upgrading the living standards of our people in the areas affected, and, thus, have helped us in the Ministry of National Defence and in the Armed Forces of the Philippines in abolishing the root causes of our problem in those areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of our people for these significant end-results of Australia's assistance to these particular development programs. I'm therefore very optimistic, your excellency, that your visit with us at this time will further solidify the programs of cooperation between our two nations.''
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no objection to the tabling of the full text as made available to the Embassy by the Philippine authorities. Mr Sinclair spoke extempore and without notes and no record was taken of his remarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that the text of Mr Enrile's remarks justify the interpretation placed on it by the South China Morning Post article of 3 August under the headline ''Australian Aid helps Manila Subdue Rebels!'' There is no question of our aid helping the Philippine Government to monitor the security situation in the area. It is an unfortunate fact that social tensions, political problems and insurgency activities are generally greatest in areas such as Northern Samar which are most depressed and economically deprived. Australia's program of development assistance aid is thus intended to help remove the poverty which is one of the basic causes of unrest. Mr Enrile has rightly drawn attention to this role for Australian assistance. He has not sought in his remarks to associate Australia with specific anti-insurgency activities. I see no need for the Australian Government to reconsider its program of civil aid to the Philippines nor to suspend its program of defence cooperation with that country as proposed by Senator Tate.

In my reply on that occasion I indicated that this was a developing area in the activities of the Department of Social Security and that I would take up with my Department the points which the honourable senator raised with respect to uniformity. I have a supplementary answer which is a little over a page long. Rather than take the time of the Senate I seek leave to incorporate that answer in Hansard.

        The document read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, there is a degree of general uniformity between the procedures adopted by Social Security Appeals Tribunals. Each Tribunal seeks to ensure that its procedures are such as to ensure that, within its advisory role, the best consideration is afforded to the merits of each case. To this end, Tribunals seek to ensure that an appellant is aware of all factors relevant to his appeal and is afforded an adequate opportunity to address the Tribunal on those factors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The detailed procedures of the various Tribunals do however vary. This is a matter on which my Department has been consulting with Tribunals with a view to drawing up detailed uniform procedures. These would include pro forma correspondence, information leaflets etc. as well as standardised procedures, all of which would be designed to be of maximum assistance to people appealing to Tribunals and those advising or assisting them. This consultation will take some time yet to reach finality but should be of great benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as legal representation before Tribunals is concerned, the initial practice when the Tribunals were created in 1975 was to allow lawyers to be present only in very rare cases. This practice has been progressively liberalised in recent years and the currently prevailing principle is that an appellant to a Social Security Appeals Tribunal may be represented by whomever he pleases, whether a lawyer, welfare worker, relative, neighbour or friend. All Tribunals are aware of and apply this principle. At the same time, it is hoped and expected that lawyers will appreciate the non-adversary nature of proceedings before the Tribunal and not adopt the more formal demeanour appropriate to Court proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, Senator Coates raised the question of providing to appellants a statement of the Department's case before the hearing. The standard practice is that Tribunals provide to appellants in advance of hearings a copy of the submission made to them by my Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I would stress again that the operations of Social Security Appeals Tribunals is an area of developing refinement, the aim of which is to improve the effectiveness of the appeals system. As part of the process of identifying areas in need of attention, I would be grateful if honourable senators would draw to my attention any areas of perceived difficulty.

        Anyone paying off a loan or an overdraft will have realised, sometimes to his or her surprise, that the 'interest' charged is, in effect, somewhat higher than anticipated: There are 'establishment fees', 'service fees' and other euphemisms for changes which add to the cost of the loan and which at least in the case of overdrafts are debited automatically to the borrower's account. This Bill is designed to bring out into the open these additional costs which can add .3 per cent, .5 per cent, 1 per cent, even more to the interest bill of a loan in any one year by providing that banks and financial corporations may not make any charges in respect of loans and overdrafts except interest. There is a good case for saying that banks and institutions should be able to cover these administrative costs without raising the interest rate.

        The year 1980-81 was a particularly good year for banks. The Bank of New South Wales announced an increase from $124m to $165m, a record profit and an increase of 33.3 per cent in that one year. The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited increased its profits from $136m to $175m, an increase of 29 per cent. Other banks reported increases of similar magnitude: National Bank of Australasia Limited: up 33.7 per cent; Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited: up 27.1 per cent; the Commercial Bank of Australia Limited: up 19.3 per cent. During that same year, 1980-81, interest rates on home loans and small business overdrafts increased sharply to around 17 per cent to 20 per cent and building starts declined dramatically. For many young couples the dream of owning a home became a mirage. Families who were locked into paying off a housing loan were put into a squeeze: They had to use an ever-increasing proportion of their income to pay off the loan and go without in other areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The year 1981-82 was not quite the bonanza for banks and financial institutions as the previous year but the basic trend continued: On 22 September 1982 the Australian Financial Review carried a report headed: ''Commonwealth Bank says profit gain 'just above inflation'''-allowing for some changes in accounting procedures the bank had shown an 18 per cent profit improvement. The ANZ Group showed a profit of $180.47m for the year to 30 September 1982, an increase of 2. 9 per cent on the previous year, but others had done even better: For the same period Custom Credit Corp. Ltd., the finance subsidiary of the National Bank of Australasia Ltd, increased profit by 2.62 per cent to $30.8m and CBFC, the Commonwealth Bank Group's finance arm lifted profit by 31 per cent to a new record of $14m. By absorbing administrative overheads in the interest rates charged the banks and financial corporations covered by the Bill will be obliged to present a clear picture of the obligations a borrower faces. Incidentally, it should also enable them to compete in the market place on the basis of the services offered-I note the bill-paying facility offered by some institutions- and more importantly by reducing the interest charged on loans and overdrafts and thus to introduce some degree of competition which would benefit the customer rather than the banks and financial corporations. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         â€”There would be nothing wrong with that at all. The bank accounts debits legislation is composed of three Bills which, in fact, are the legislative result of the Government's Budget decision to levy a tax on debits to cheque accounts. It is a revenue raising measure which, I must say, is typical of the type introduced by this Government in that its impacts will be inequitable as between both institutions and individuals and it bears no relation to ability to pay. The legislation will also, incidentally, add to the cost of business in the community. As a side effect it will encourage the cash economy, thus assisting tax avoidance and evasion, which the Government allegedly wants to avoid. Hence, we will be moving a second reading amendment to this legislation. Failing that, we will not oppose it. The Government will be judged on its actions in this regard, as it will be judged on its actions in regard to the rest of this disastrous Budget.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The tax, which is to commence on 1 January 1983, if that is possible, will be levied at the rate of 10c for amounts up to $99, 25c for amounts from $100 to $ 499, 50c for amounts from $500 to $4,999 and $1 for amounts above that level. Quite clearly, in these circumstances the proportionate impact of the tax will be much higher for smaller transactions and, as such, it is regressive. Bank cheques are exempt, as are debits to accounts of banks held in other banks. Institutions exempt from the tax include benevolent and religious bodies, hospitals, schools and government departments. Foreign diplomatic and consular personnel will also be exempt. The liability to pay the tax will rest with the banks, except in very special circumstances, but the banks will recover the taxes from their customers. Thus this is, in fact, a tax on individuals and business people who will eventually pass it on to the consumer. The mortgage payers, those who pay by having money taken out of cheque accounts, and those who have regular payments removed from their cheque accounts for other purposes will bear the heaviest burden if they continue to carry out these procedures as they have in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tax discriminates unfairly between financial institutions. Savings banks, being exempt, will have an advantage over credit unions and building societies. The credit unions claim that their losses will be between $5m and $7.5m. I am sure every honourable senator in the chamber has received information from the credit unions expressing their concern in this regard. The revenue to be gained- if Budget Paper No. 1 can be relied upon, in view of the repeated variations of figures that have come out since this Budget was introduced-is estimated to be about $80m this year and about $200m in a full year although, for some reason, this fact was omitted from the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard ).
       </para>
       <para>
        An extra point which I believe should be made in this alleged States House is that this is an area of taxation, through stamp duties and charges, which has been left to the States, but I suppose we will not hear the scream from the States rights people concerning this revenue-raising matter that we heard concerning other legislation in this place. There has been considerable confusion among the States. Many honourable senators will have seen the letter written to all Western Australian senators from the Liberal Premier of Western Australia expressing his very real concern about the effect that this legislation will have on States' revenue. I will return to that letter shortly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nothing could be more calculated to drive people into the cash economy than this legislation. Businessmen have already suggested that they will in future make one cash withdrawal and make many small payments, or enter completely into the cash economy, to avoid the difficulties created by this legislation. What greater stimulus to tax evasion and tax avoidance could this be? What administrative structures will be needed to cope with the situation which will arise? The Treasurer of this country has made a considerable number of speeches in recent times expressing his concern about the effect of the cash economy in the avoidance of taxes in this community. Yet here we have a measure which will have the inevitable effect of driving people into the cash economy. As I have suggested, the tax is inequitable. It is ill-conceived and administratively clumsy, as has been pointed out by my colleague in another place. But it is part of the Budget bed. The Government has made that Budget bed and we believe it should lie in it if it persists in opposing our second reading amendment.

        I return now to the letter which was written by the Premier of Western Australia to Western Australian senators from both sides of the House expressing his concern about the matters in this legislation. I hope that at some stage the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who is at the table, will answer some of the points which are raised by that Premier. He said:

       </para>
       <para>

        Of particular concern is the specific exclusion of Government business undertakings from the institutions listed to be exempt from this tax.

       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that is not fact. I believe the Premier, on my reading of the legislation, is wrong under those circumstances. This is just a demonstration of the difficulty that has arisen because the Treasurer has trespassed into what has previously been a States area and has therefore created confusion not only amongst the community in general but also amongst the State Premiers, his own party colleagues. The Premier goes on to list his concerns and doubts about the efficacy and equity of this legislation. I believe it would be worth while to incorporate this letter in Hansard. However, I have not yet shown it to the Minister. I will hand it over to him, hoping at the end of my speech that I will be able to have it incorporated.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, we believe that this tax, because it is regressive, inequitable and administratively clumsy and because it discriminates between individuals and, in particular, between institutions, is an unwise form of revenue raising. We are particularly surprised that a Government which so often in this place, as it did this morning at Question Time and last week during debates, relies on the States rights argument as a defence for its actions, should now introduce a measure in an area which is traditionally within the purview of the States-an area which it apparently has entered into without any consultation with the States-hence leaving the States in great confusion. It is for this reason, therefore, that, on behalf of the Opposition, I move:

        This move follows the recent Commonwealth Government action to alter the previous exemption arrangements for diesel fuel used for off-road purposes. This move had the effect of taxing State business undertakings such as Westrail and the State Energy Commission. The effect will be to increase transport costs to farmers and other country people and to increase the costs of electricity generation in remote country areas. Overall, the additional cost to the State Government of the lifting of the excise exemption for diesel fuel used off-road is estimated to be in the vicinity of $12 million per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        These decisions follow unilateral changes to the tax sharing arrangements imposed by the Commonwealth on the States in 1981 which cost the States a total sum of $374 million in 1981-82. Translated into 1982-83 terms, the amount which the Commonwealth has appropriated from the States and absorbed into its own budget would amount to $770 million this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        One wonders when this type of action by the Commonwealth will stop. First the changes to the tax sharing arrangements, then the removal of the diesel fuel excise exemption and now the proposed tax on bank transactions. All these changes were made without any consultation with the States. Moreover, I protested, in writing, to the Prime Minister on 26 August regarding the tax on bank transactions and he has not even had the courtesy to reply.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government's actions on the tax on bank transactions, the diesel fuel exemption and the tax sharing arrangements lead me to strongly question whether we really have a co-operative Federation in any meaningful sense of the term. The situation has now arisen whereby the Commonwealth is not only failing to consult the States on matters which significantly affect State finances, but is now turning to implementing taxes directly on State Governments using its powers over excise duties and through the proposed tax on the bank transactions of State business undertakings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent studies have shown that the Australian taxation system is already highly centralised by comparison with other OECD countries. The proposed tax on bank transactions would result in an even greater centralisation of taxation power in Australia with the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        As representatives of the States I would ask that, when the Bills associated with the proposed tax on bank transactions are debated in the Senate, you consider the effect that the imposition of such a tax would have on the States and their business undertakings. It is not so much the cost to State business undertakings of the proposed tax but the principle involved. While Section 114 of the Constitution states inter alia that the Commonwealth shall not 'impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State', the Commonwealth proposes to effectively tax business undertaking transactions, no doubt using the view that the tax is imposed on bank transactions and not property as such.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge you to ensure that amendments are suggested to that legislation to ensure that the debits made by State and local government business undertakings are within the definition of excluded debits so that their accounts will be exempt accounts.

         â€”These three banking Bills seek to impose a tax on debits to bank cheque accounts. Debits resulting from cheques drawn on accounts, such as for periodic transfer of payments, and the charging of interest and bank fees will be subject to the new tax. The prime target is debits to current accounts held with trading banks. These Bills can be seen as a small but significant step towards the broadening of the tax base. In that respect, the Australian Democrats endorse enthusiastically the principle of broadening the tax base. However, we are not so enthusiastic about these Bills for a number of reasons, which I will shortly outline. I wish to make it plain that we endorse the principle of broadening the tax base. We believe that the burden of income tax on both companies and individuals is far too high. We strongly support the moves to bring to justice those who do not pay their fair share of tax. Anyone who is not paying his or her fair share of tax is increasing the burden of tax on other taxpayers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, in these Bills several principles have been violated, which principles , we believe the Government ought to keep in mind. Ideally, a tax Bill ought to be equitable, cheap to administer from the point of view of both the Commonwealth and the individual or company involved and, above all, should not distort the financial system or affect the decisions made by companies or people . In the words of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, 'Any tax should have a neutral impact'. We cannot pretend to live in an ideal world. Few taxes could perfectly meet these criteria. However, I put it to the Senate that this tax, as it is presently envisaged, is not equitable and will not be cheap to administer from the point of view of either the banks or the Government. Most importantly, it will seriously distort the financial system. These Bills will impose a tax ranging from 10c for debits of less than $100 up to $1 for debits of $5,000 or more. I put it to honourable senators that this is extremely inequitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I give an example which I admit is an extreme case. If I were to draw one cent from my cheque account I would have to pay a tax of 10c as well as stamp duty and bank charges. The tax alone, however, would amount to 1,000 per cent. On the other hand, if I were fortunate enough to win $1m in a lottery and deposited my winnings in a cheque account and then wrote a cheque for that amount, the tax payable would be $1 or 0.0001 per cent. Can any tax which varies from 1,000 per cent to 0.0001 per cent be described as fair? They are the facts of the matter.

         â€”I admit that it is an extreme example. But it illustrates the point that the tax varies dramatically. Further-this point touches also on the aspects of neutrality-the tax will be inequitable in its operation. As presently proposed it will discriminate against non-bank financial institutions. Financial institutions such as credit unions and building societies are major customers of banks because, by law, only banks can provide cheque account facilities. This means that non-cash withdrawals can be made only from non-bank financial institutions if an institution draws a cheque on its bank account. All such withdrawals, including periodic payments made on a member's behalf, would be taxable under the proposed legislation. But all withdrawals and payments made from savings bank accounts other than cheque accounts would be exempt from the tax.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        An amount in the order of $1.6 billion is held at call with credit unions and building societies across the country; funds which, by their very nature, tend to be used in most instances for transaction purposes. But the Government's policy, in the absence of implementation of a sensible recommendation made by the Campbell committee in this area, is that banks shall have the sole right to facilitate the use of such funds for transactional purposes through the provisions of cheque accounts. Thus, if we pay bills with bank cheques drawn on our savings accounts, the transactions will not be subject to the new tax. But similar services offered by non-bank institutions will attract the tax. Banks will also be exempt from tax when paying their normal operating costs, including salary cheques. That, of course, is a substantial saving to the trading banks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many, if not all, honourable senators will have received a letter dated 10 November from a Mr Peter Timmins, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federation of Credit Unions. In that letter Mr Timmins informs us that he discussed several issues with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and that Mr Howard's concluding comment was that he agreed with the logic of many of the points made by Mr Timmins. Mr Howard said, however, that the Government was not inclined to amend a revenue Bill in the Senate, although he would keep the matter under close review. Mr Timmins accused the Treasurer of refusing to discuss Bills before they were introduced and said that Mr Howard later rubbished what the non -bank financial institutions were saying.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interests of brevity I will make one final point. I understand that the banks are having so many difficulties integrating the tax into their computers that the Treasurer has put back the planned date for the introduction of the new tax from 1 January to 1 March of next year. The Government amended the Bill in the House of Representatives to remove the 1 January date and leave the date of effect to be announced by proclamation. If the date is put back to 1 March there is more than adequate time for the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations to report on the Bill in terms of the amendment that I have circulated. We are not proposing a marathon investigation. The Treasurer admitted that there are problems with this piece of legislation. The Australian Labor Party has also pointed out-its amendment sets this out-that it is strongly critical of this legislation. Although it is part of the Government's revenue raising strategy announced in the Budget, we believe that that is not sufficient reason for the Senate to carry out its allotted task to review legislation and, if it is found wanting, to amend it and send it back to the House of Representatives. The Australian Democrats do not adopt the attitude of the Australian Labor Party that any Bill that has a dollar sign attached to it should not be looked at by this chamber. I therefore urge honourable senators to support the motion that I shall move at a later stage that this Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. The Democrats will be opposing the third reading of this Bill but we do have some comments to make during the Committee stage, assuming that the Bill gets that far.

         -The Bank Account Debits Tax Administration Bill was due to be discussed by the Senate some two weeks ago. It is a most unfortunate situation that we are discussing this important measure in the dying stages of this Parliament. The only reason we are doing that is that the Australian Labor Party gave a guarantee to the Government that it would not oppose this legislation. I believe that such an action is reprehensible, when the Labor Party knows full well that it, together with the Australian Democrats and myself, is in a position to refer this matter to a Senate committee. In fact , it is selling down the drain many thousands of members of credit unions and co -operative housing societies and building societies throughout the whole length and breadth of Australia because those members are the ones who will be discriminated against by this legislation.

        Because of the time constraints that are now imposed upon us, it is not for me to canvass or go over the matters that have already been raised. In support of the move to send this matter to a committee for further consideration, I quote what the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said in answer to a question by Senator Bjelke- Petersen. At page 2240 of the Senate Hansard, under the heading 'Credit Union and Building Society Cheques' Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle had this to say:

       <para>
        On 26 October 1982 (Hansard, pages 1789-90), Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked me as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice regarding claims by credit unions and permanent building societies that they are disadvantaged under the bank account debits tax arrangements by comparison with banks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a fact that 'cheques' drawn by banks (including savings banks) will not give rise to a liability to bank account debits tax while 'cheques' drawn by credit unions, building societies and, where relevant, other non-bank financial institutions will do so. To see this position in proper perspective, however, it is necessary to have regard for the general context of the tax and the operating modes of all the institutions concerned. I have given assurances to the credit union movement that the Government does not wish the tax to cause serious disadvantage to credit unions (or, for that matter, to other non-bank financial institutions). The Government accordingly will be closely monitoring the situation and keeping the legislation under review.
       </para>
       <para>
        What sort of basis is that on which to introduce legislation which, credit unions have indicated to all honourable senators, will seriously disadvantage them, as it will other non-banking institutions? If what Senator Siddons has said is correct-I have no reason at all to doubt what he said-and if the scheme cannot be introduced until 1 March next year, there are added reasons why the Senate ought to refer this matter to a standing committee for examination so that non-banking institutions can have an opportunity of giving detailed information to the Senate as to how seriously they will be disadvantaged. After all, one of our major functions is to ensure that information supplied to us from the electorate is made available to the whole of the Senate. As part of that function Senate standing committees gather information, distil it and provide it to us. I believe it would be in the interests of the Senate and of equity to support the reference of this Bill to a committee. I will be supporting that proposition. I hope that other honourable senators, even at this late stage, will do so.

         â€”Many issues have been canvassed in this relatively short debate in relation to the bank debits legislation, but I would like to mention a number of things before attempting to answer those issues. First and foremost, it was pleasing to note that Senator Siddons supports the Government's ambition to seek a wider-based tax which will lead to reductions in income tax. It is significant that the Budget of August this year increased some indirect taxes and introduced new ones, of which the bank debits tax is one, and of course was able, by virtue of the revenue raised in that way, to provide tax savings for families. That started on 1 November. We know the benefits of the home interest rebates scheme, the increase in the spouse rebate and the reduction in the slope of the rates of tax applying to lower and middle income earners. For that reason the Government's objective is to continue its program of broadening the tax base to achieve further income tax reductions and to provide more incentive.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I turn now to some of the issues that were raised in the debate. Both Senator Siddons and Senator Harradine concentrated on perceived inequalities or inequities that may arise for building societies and credit union activities. The Government's position is that those assertions are by no means clear. In fact the proposed tax may or may not discriminate unfairly against the non-bank financial institutions such as those mentioned by honourable senators. The point is that it is probable that, if action along the lines taken by this legislation were not taken, there would be clear discrimination against trading banks. As we know, credit unions and building societies which provide cheque-paying facilities in conjunction with trading banks would otherwise be exempt, to the disadvantage of trading banks. For that reason, it is reasonable that this tax apply to debits being arranged in that way. Most transactions which occur via credit unions and building societies are cash transactions and will not be touched by this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the activity known as the use of bank cheques by trading banks to pay accounts-I think this was alluded to by Senator Harradine-I think it is pertinent to note that charges are made by trading banks for that facility. It might cost 50c or more each time such a cheque is used. It is not a free facility. It is not as though the building societies and credit unions will be unfairly disadvantaged in that respect in that they otherwise would be able to provide a cheaper facility.

         â€”That is the point I am making. This works to the advantage of credit unions and building societies. Further points were raised in the debate, particularly by Senator Harradine. A copy of an amendment with respect to credit unions which Senator Harradine plans to move has just been put in front of me. The Government will oppose the amendments to be moved at the Committee stage by both the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine. Senator Siddons proposes to move a motion after the second reading of the Bill. The Government will oppose referring the Bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for the reasons I have outlined. The Government notes that the Australian Labor Party has indicated that it will not support that move either.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Labor Party has moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill. Indeed, it draws our attention to alleged discrimination between financial institutions. Again, I refer to my earlier remarks when answering points raised by Senator Siddons and Senator Harradine. Specific questions relating to the efficiency, equity and practicability of the proposed tax are raised in the motion the Australian Democrats propose to move following the second reading of the Bill. I point out, first of all, that it is very doubtful that there could be a more efficient tax than the one which is proposed in this legislation. It will involve a very small number of taxpayers. Of course, once the banks have amended their computer programs and their systems to provide for the tax there will be clear administrative savings to the Government. The whole tax should operate very smoothly. In relation to equity, I think that Senator Siddons drew our attention to a rather fanciful example of drawing a cheque for 1c and being charged 10c. He concluded that that represents a tax of about--

         â€”Senator Siddons says that it represents a tax of about 1,000 per cent. He compared that with a tax at the other end of the scale. I have to say that one could draw on any number of examples to support that kind of argument. But, of course, it is very unlikely that that sort of situation would arise. Anybody who put himself in that situation clearly would not be acting in his own best interests. Obviously, people will not undertake that kind of action . Furthermore, as regards equity I think Senator Siddons would acknowledge that the sliding scale as proposed in this legislation is clearly in favour of a more equitable approach. It differs from that of the States with respect to stamp duties on cheques and other bills which, of course, are applied usually at ad valorem or flat rates of duty on each cheque. To follow Senator Siddons's argument, nothing could be more inequitable than the stamp duties that are applicable to bank debits imposed by States in that respect.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I refer now to the practicability of the proposed tax. Consistent with the Government's aim of broadening that indirect tax base which we spoke of earlier, this will be a relatively low tax. I believe it will be a most efficient tax to collect. It will have a minimal overall effect on the banking system in the long run. For all those reasons, the Government will oppose the amendment moved by the Labor Party, the motion and the amendments to be moved by the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine's proposed amendments.

         â€”Just briefly, the Australian Labor Party does not support the referral of this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. This is revenue raising legislation which is part of the Budget. I agree with the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine that it is likely to be inefficient. It is certainly inequitable and certainly places an uneven burden on various individuals and institutions. The tax is due to start on 1 January. We believe that the tax will be seen to be inequitable by the whole community, but it is part of the Budget. As I said, the Government has made that Budget bed and it must lie in it.

       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments will have the effect of excluding building societies from the tax . Building societies are very important financial institutions in our society today. We can see no reason why they should be discriminated against in favour of the trading banks. Literally millions of people are involved with deposits with building societies. This tax will discriminate against those people who have their money at call with building societies. I do not want to go over the ground that I went over at the second reading stage of the Bank Account Debits Tax Administration Bill, but the comments of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Senator Messner) have not in any way explained the inequity of this piece of legislation. We have moved these amendments in an attempt at least to solve one of the glaring inequities of the legislation.

         â€”I briefly say that the Opposition, although having great sympathy for both Senator Siddons's amendments and Senator Harradine's proposed amendments, will not be supporting these amendments. This is a revenue raising piece of legislation; it is part of the Budget. The legislation is inequitable. It is everything that was said about it at the second reading stage. These amendments remove what may be considered two anomalies, but there remain many other anomalies. There remains the fact that the distribution of the levy which is placed on debit transactions in banks is grossly inequitable going as it does from 10c for debits of up to $99 to $1 for debits of up to $5,000. What needs to be done, if we are going to do anything, is to change the whole of the legislation to remove all of those inequities.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has made this decision to raise revenue in this way. On one hand the Australian Democrats say they believe in broadening the tax base, in making the tax collections much broader in this way, yet on the other hand they want to pick out specific exclusions of this type. Although we agree and have said that the building societies and the credit unions are treated unfairly compared with the savings banks, we are faced with the fact that this is a revenue-raising measure which is part of the Budget. As such we will leave the Government to face the difficulties and opprobrium. If the Government and the Australian Democrats want to come back with a complete re-wording of the legislation, removing all anomalies, that is a different kettle of fish. At the moment we will not support the amendments.

         â€”I will give a quick reply to Senator Siddons. I understand that the Government has calculated the equivalent of a flat rate of tax in order to raise the equivalent amount of revenue and that the rate applicable would be in the order of 20c a transaction. I do not want to reiterate the arguments I put during the second reading debate in respect of these matters but I just say once again that if these amendments are carried and incorporated in the legislation there would be discrimination against trading banks operating in this situation.

        The effect of these amendments would be to exclude credit unions from the operation of this tax Bill. A credit union is defined as 'a society incorporated under a law of a State or Territory which has the objects of the raising of a fund by subscriptions or deposits of its members and the making of loans from that fund to its members'. There are over 600 credit unions in Australia. They have some 1.6 million members and assets of about $3 billion. So far as the State of Tasmania is concerned, some 65,000 members of the Tasmanian community are members of credit unions. These people will be adversely affected by the Bill. I am concerned about the fact that they have not had an opportunity of expressing fully to the Government or to the Senate the dramatic effect that this legislation would have. Admittedly they have seen the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and they have done a very good job in providing information to us. Nevertheless, I believe the full ramification of this Bill is not yet realised by the Government. That was indicated by what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Senator Messner) said in reply to Senator Bjelke-Petersen.

        Without canvassing the matters that were discussed before and in view of the time constraints that are on us in the dying stages of this Parliament, I wish only to express my disappointment that this measure was not sent to our Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for examination because not only these matters but also the matters that have been raised in the debate could have been given more attention. The Standing Committee could have made certain recommendations which I am sure would have been satisfactory to all concerned. I propose the amendments and hope that they are carried even at this late stage.

         â€”I am obliged to say a few words on this matter. As chairman of a credit union in Queensland I find the provisions of this legislation concerning credit unions quite iniquitous. I take the view that has been taken by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Senator Grimes, that we are in a bind in that this is a revenue raising measure and although some changes need to be made to the legislation there are no means by which we in this chamber can bring that about.
        </para>

       <para>
        I put it to the Committee that the imposition on credit unions in Queensland is more substantial perhaps than it is in other States. Not only are cheques involving withdrawals subject to duty but also the State Government imposes a stamp duty on such transactions. Now there is to be a further charge. Transactions made by members of these community organisations will now be subject to a triple charge.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is my view that the legislation is an imposition on credit unions. I will not go into the other areas covered by Senator Grimes except to say that it is unfortunate that this legislation has been introduced without a proper investigation being conducted into its effect on credit unions. Nevertheless, the Opposition finds itself, as Senator Grimes has said, unable to support the amendments. I feel obliged to make these comments because the credit union movement in Queensland and throughout Australia is substantial and the difficulties faced by members of credit unions as a result of various impositions have not been properly recognised.

The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) mentioned that if building societies and credit unions were excluded other areas affected would be left without any redress. We agree with that. For that reason we suggested that the matter should go to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. Of course, one other very big sector of the community will be seriously discriminated against; namely, local government, particularly local government in Queensland.

         â€”Of course we have the numbers and of course we have the desire to exclude building societies and credit unions but in doing so we would create other anomalies in what is already an anomalous piece of legislation. To do so without altering the regressive nature of the imposts which would result from this legislation is quite wrong. As I said, this is a revenue raising procedure of which we do not approve. However, this measure will raise $80m this year and $200m in the next Budget year. I think it would be quite wrong of us piecemeal to pick out organisations such as credit unions and building societies without giving this matter much more consideration. This legislation is part of the Government's budgetary strategy. It is typical of the budgetary strategy in that the impost falls inequitably in this way. It is for that reason that we do not believe piecemeal amendments to this legislation are justified.

For the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to say that there would be a time constraint on the Committee to decide by 1 January is just incorrect. The Committee would have had at least until 1 March. It will be 1 March before the banks can sort out their computer programs. It is not an easy tax to administer, as is apparent from the difficulties that the banks are having in correcting their computer programs to impose the tax. It will be an extraordinarily difficult tax for the Government to administer. It is extraordinarily inequitable. The position of the Labor Party in this matter, I think, deserves very severe criticism. We have done what we can about it. Our position has been made clear. We will have to leave it at that.

        COTTON LEVY BILL 1982
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on cotton produced in Australia. The levy has been requested by cotton growers and is intended to be used in financing a research scheme. The related Cotton Research Bill 1982 contains provisions for the collection of the levy, its payment into a trust account to be created for the purpose and all the measures necessary to implement the research arrangements. The levy will apply to all raw cotton produced. For this purpose, leviable cotton is the cotton fibre separated from the cotton seed in the process of ginning.
       </para>
       <para>
        The operative rate of levy is to be initially $1 per unit of 225 kg which, in industry terms, is $1 per bale. The levy rate may be changed by regulation up to a maximum of $3 per 225 kg. Changes may be made only after consideration of a report from the growers' organisation, that is, the Australian Cotton Growers' Research Association. On behalf of all growers the Association has requested that the leavy apply to cotton production from the start of the 1983 harvest. The Government accepted that request and it is for that reason that the Bill provides for the levy to be imposed on all cotton produced on or after 1 March 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        The levy is payable by growers but in practice will be paid on their behalf by the processors, that is, the three organisations which gin all cotton produced in Australia. They are, in Queensland, the Cotton Marketing Board and, in New South Wales, the Namoi Cotton Co-operative Ltd and Auscott Pty Ltd. It can be expected that the amount of levy collected in 1982-83, that is, on cotton ginned in March, April and May 1983, will approximate $200,000. This year, in an exceptionally favourable season, cotton production is close to 600,000 bales. The indications are that production is not likely to expand significantly in the next few years. I commend the Bill to honourable senators.

        COTTON RESEARCH BILL 1982

        The purpose of this Bill is the implementation of a cotton research scheme along the same lines as other rural industry research schemes. Its provisions include necessary arrangements for the collection of the research levy imposed under the Cotton Levy Bill 1982. It brings into being a Cotton Research Trust Account from which cotton research will be funded. It establishes a committee which will recommend research programs and the disbursement of funds from the research account.

        The Bill should be read as one with the Cotton Levy Bill 1982 and is to become operative on the same day as it. The levy is intended to apply to all cotton produced from the start of the next harvest season in March 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cotton growers have sought the implementation of the research scheme and have signified their agreement to payment of the levy. For practical and administrative reasons, however, payments to the Commonwealth will be made by the processors, that is, the three organisations which own the cotton gins. The processors will be entitled to deduct the amounts of levy from their payments to cotton growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Levies will be payable in the month following the month of ginning. As they are received into revenue like amounts will be paid into the Cotton Research Trust Account. The Government has undertaken to match on a dollar-for-dollar basis expenditure of industry moneys from the research account. Any expenditure for research from the account will be subject to ministerial approval on the recommendation of the Cotton Research Committee to be established by the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Research Account will have in it two separate accounts. Into one will be paid amounts equal to levy received plus Commonwealth contributions. The other will be credited with interest on investments, proceeds of sale of assets and produce, donations and, if any, penalty incurred because of delays in levy payments. Such moneys will not be matched by the Commonwealth. Their disbursement will be subject to the same conditions as the industry and Commonwealth contributions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Cotton Research Committee will have 10 members of which five will represent growers and the others will represent, respectively, the Department of Primary Industry, as Chairman, the Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australian universities, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        As is customary, membership will be subject to ministerial appointment. The Bill provides for grower representatives to be selected and appointed by the Minister from a list of names submitted by the growers' organisation. It is intended that the five appointees will include at least one member representing the growers who deliver seed cotton to each of the three processors. In Queensland the sole processor is the Cotton Marketing Board. The others, in New South Wales, are the Namoi Cotton Co-operative Ltd and Auscott Pty Ltd. The Bill provides for the appointment of deputies. There are customary provisions requiring disclosure of interest by members and deputies. Remuneration entitlements of both are to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. The Committee will have the responsibility of formulating and submitting to the Minister for Primary Industry recommendations as to a program of research and levels of expenditure from the Research Account.
       </para>
       <para>
        As is the case with other research schemes operative for a number of rural industries the purposes for which moneys may be expended are scientific, economic or technical research and associated activities. These include research training and dissemination of information. In carrying out its responsibilities the Committee will be expected to establish effective means of determining cotton research needs and priorities in all the detail that is necessary and, in the course of time, no less effective arrangements for review of its own activities and the conduct and outcome of research funded on its recommendation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cotton research scheme which is being implemented reflects established policy of the Government in fostering research funded jointly by the Commonwealth and industry which will help overcome problems, raise productivity, contain costs or improve quality to the benefit of the industry and of the economy as a whole. The cotton industry has contributed voluntarily to research for the past nine years, starting with a levy rate of 25 cents per bale, which has been increased to 50 cents in 1975, to 70 cents in 1979 and the present maximum of $1 per bale in 1980. That in itself is acknowledgement of the value growers have seen in augmenting from their own resources research carried out by CSIRO, two State departments and tertiary institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are continuing challenges in coping with problems of seasonal conditions and the incidence of pests and diseases. Continued success in selling to selective markets influenced by rapid technological change in spinning machinery requires increasing attention to fibre quality. The scope for additional research is indeed considerable. Cotton has become Australia's fifth largest agricultural export crop, shipments in 1981-82 being valued at $117m. The industry's production and export potential will undoubtedly be enhanced and the industry will be helped to use its resources even more effectively as the benefits of further well-directed research become available. I commend the Bill to honourable senators.

         â€”These Bills establish a levy fund and research scheme for the cotton industry in the same manner as those which exist in most other rural industries. For the past nine years a voluntary scheme has operated without government involvement. This is an attempt, belated though it may be, to bring the cotton industry into line with other industries and make provision for the Commonwealth to match the levies on a dollar for dollar basis. The Bills also provide for the establishment of a Cotton Research Committee and a Cotton Research Trust Account and contain a miscellany of other provisions such as normally relate to the establishment of such a scheme. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill.

         â€”The Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1982 is designed to correct an anomaly which was detected by the Opposition spokesman, Mr Hurford, some 2 1/2 years ago whereby fishing vessels which are over 150 tons and over 21 metres in length get a bounty but fishing vessels which are over 150 tons but under 21 metres in length do not. To correct that anomaly is undoubtedly a worthy enterprise and I make only two points in respect of it. One is that this has not been the world's speediest legislative performance, taking 2 1/2 years to produce a three line amendment. The second point I make is that the drafting of that three line amendment, notwithstanding that it took 2 1/2 years to bring to fruition, is something of a masterpiece of opacity. One would not have thought that it would be possible to create even more confusion as to which precise vessels were bountiable, but that seems to have been accomplished with some flair.

         â€”We are told that the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1982 rectifies a minor drafting error. Whether or not that is true the fact of the matter is that if this error is genuine why on earth has it taken so long for the Government to detect it? The problem was drawn to the attention of the lower House in a speech by an honourable member on 27 March 1980. Here is December 1982-32 months later-and something is finally being done about it. Fortunately, it appears that nobody has been disadvantaged by this error but as Senator Evans pointed out something is radically wrong with the system if it takes this long to rectify a very simple error. Nobody who has had anything to do with this Bill-the Minister, the Government or the staff involved-can take any comfort from it.

        The purpose of this Bill is to establish a new ceiling on the export charge leviable on currants, sultanas and raisins now that the operative rate of the charge has been increased by regulation to the maximum allowed under the existing Act. Opportunity is also taken in this Bill to redefine procedures applicable to increasing the operative rate in the future and to remove from the Act certain unnecessary words.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moneys collected under the dried fruits export charge are used to finance the operations of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation which controls the export marketing and overseas promotion of Australian dried vine fruit. The Corporation has been under financial pressure due in part to a poor 1981 harvest, with a consequent sharp fall in receipts in the 1981-82 financial year, but more importantly to steadily rising costs. Action to improve its current financial position has already been taken, with industry agreement, by Statutory Rules Number 100 proclaimed on 29 April 1982. Those Rules provided for an increase in the operative rate of the charge from the $4.50 per tonne which had applied since 1976 to $7 per tonne of dried fruit exported, the new rate being equal to the maximum allowed under the current Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before the Senate seeks to raise the maximun permissible charge from $ 7 to $15 per tonne in order to enable the operative rate to be increased beyond $7 per tonne when this becomes necessary. It is expected that the new ceiling will obviate the need for further amendment to the Act for a reasonable number of years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main industry organisation, the Australian Dried Fruits Association, has been consulted in the past on matters affecting the funding of the Corporation, the operations of which play an important role in contributing to the viability of the Industry. It is proposed that these consultations will now be formalised under the provision in the Bill for discussion between the Department of Primary Industry and the producers' organisation on any future suggested change to the operative rate of charge on the export of dried fruits.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill also seeks to remove a provision of the original Act which, I am advised, is unnecessary, The provision in question is sub-section 3 (3) which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''All moneys payable under this section in respect of any dried fruits shall be paid on or before the entry of those dried fruits for export to such officers in the respective States as are prescribed''.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised that the words ''to such officers in the respective States as are prescribed'' are superfluous as the identification of the officers to whom the charge is to be paid can be dealt with administratively. Accordingly it is proposed that a new provision be substituted for the existing one.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is proposed that the Amendment Act will come into effect as soon as it receives the Royal Assent.

         â€”I indicate on behalf of the Opposition that it does not oppose the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill, which establishes a new ceiling on the export charge leviable on currants, sultanas and raisins. The moneys collected in this way finance the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, which controls the export marketing and overseas promotion of our dried vine fruits. Simply, the Corporation needs the money because of the poor harvest in 1981 and because of rising costs. The levy was increased by regulation on 29 April from $4.50 per tonne to $7 per tonne. This was the maximum allowed under the old Act. The effect of this Bill will be to increase the maximum rate from $7 per tonne to $15 per tonne. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has quite rightly pointed out, there should be no need for further amendment for many years. Our spokesman in another place, Mr Kerin, has described this as an almost open-ended levy.

       <para>
        There are difficulties in the dried fruits industry. Production in 1983 is expected to be something like 75,000 tonnes or 27 per cent down on 1982 and a carry-over from 1982 of about 25,000 tonnes is probable. As the domestic market is only about 29,000 tonnes, this will leave in the vicinity of 70,000 tonnes to be disposed of on the export market-a market which is notoriously unstable and hard to predict. It is affected by the quality of our fruit, the policy of the European Economic Community towards Greece's surplus and the size of the Northern Hemisphere crop. In these circumstances, the prospects are not very bright. The new ceiling is very high. It is possible that a huge increase could be applied without adequate parliamentary scrutiny under these circumstances and , for that reason, I am sure that the dried fruits industry and those in this place who have its interests at heart will keep a close watch on the situation as it develops. As it is policy to fund the Corporation in this way and as we quite clearly need considerable assistance to ensure that our dried fruits crop is exported efficiently and that markets are found, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation which apparently is acceptable to the industry.

         â€”The dried vine fruits industry in Australia is an extremely important primary industry sector and it has been going through some difficult times. Up until the late 1970s, the industry showed a great deal of progress and I believe it could have looked forward at that time to a fairly healthy future. Consumption in Australia has been reasonable and, indeed, has been increasing at the level one would expect in terms of the population. Also in the 1970s, we made some fairly good increases in our exports, and the export price has been reasonable particularly as we have moved into the 1980s. The 1981 -82 season was certainly a lot higher than the previous low season, in 1978-79.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, some points need to be raised in regard to the future. They are of concern right across the board and are certainly of concern to the major dried vine fruit industry areas in South Australia and Victoria. These points apply especially to the recent harvest yields of, in particular, Greece, Turkey and South Africa. Those three countries are our major competitors in world trade. We have traditionally sold most of our dried vine fruit products to European Economic Community countries. In view of the fact that our competitors are Greece, Turkey and South Africa, I do not think that it takes very much imagination to predict what is likely to happen in the immediate future. The entry of Greece into the EEC has already sent shock waves through the industry in Australia. Certainly, the EEC's setting of a minimum import price of about $1 ,000 a tonne means that our current export price of $1,150 a tonne will have to come down and our industry certainly cannot look to the previous high price it was able to get in the last growing season.
       </para>
       <para>
        Everyone agrees that the impact on Australia's industry could be adverse if the EEC market closes down to the extent which could be predicted. Since our export market takes about 61 per cent of our total product, any failing in our export markets will immediately have dire consequences, particularly in the growing areas in the riverlands of South Australia and the two wheat growing areas in Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another point is that our other major competitor, apart from the EEC, is South Africa. South Africa is seeking to develop markets. It was initially successful, particularly in two of our minor markets in which we could have expected some growth. Those markets are Japan and Canada. We had been making some headway in both those markets, but South Africa, in a much more aggressive selling style than we have adopted, beat us in both of them. We certainly cannot look at those markets now, as we could two years ago, as possible developing markets when our EEC export market fails.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, the world DVF industry certainly is suffering chronic oversupply. We cannot look in any sanguine way at our export opportunities. That problem is unfortunately shared by a large number of primary industries throughout this country. The Australian dried vine fruit industry will ultimately have to depend on crop failure in EEC countries, which is not exactly the type of thing upon which we would necessarily want to base our industry. However, on the basis of the upward and downward movements in a number of these areas one can say that we will not get a continual run of good crops. Indeed, the 1982 Californian crop, for example, was a significant failure. That should mean that there will at least be a stabilising of the world over-supply.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important to raise the points I raised because if one travels to those fruit growing areas, as I did recently, one is struck by the state of almost despair of those growers who went into those industries in times past and based their livelihoods upon them. Indeed, whole towns were based upon those industries. They look towards the future with a great deal of trepidation. When they look at that industry compared with the rest of the economy they are upset and confused. They wonder where they and their children, who normally would go into primary production, will go. They used to look to a reasonable income and a reasonable future, but they cannot do that now. We must look at restructuring this industry, as we have in the dairy industry, for example. We must look at providing support for this industry so that those people who would otherwise go bankrupt may be able to sell their farms at a reasonable price, so that the industry can be restructured and in some way be brought more into equilibrium with domestic demand and a smaller export market that Australia could look to in the future. In these ways, I believe that it is a Government initiative that is needed in these areas, apart from the points in the Bill which were requested, as I understand it-I have no cause to doubt it-by the industry. We would support these provisions, but I do not think that they go far enough and they do not really meet what is likely to be a long term chronic problem with the industry.

Like him, I happen to live in a State that is very much concerned with dried fruits exports. I am aware of the considerable problems of the fruit growing areas, particularly those of my State of South Australia along the River Murray. There are not only the difficulties associated with marketing fruit but also the difficulties with the river itself-the salinity levels and the other questions which have been raised in this place from time to time.

        Nevertheless, the Bill seeks to address itself to the very considerable problems of marketing dried fruits on the world scene. Senator Macklin has drawn our attention to a number of factors that are present in any consideration of those difficulties, but I believe that this legislation goes a long way to assist the future development of the industry and to create at least some feeling of certainty amongst growers that the Government is doing all that it can within reasonable practical bounds to achieve that. Once again, I thank honourable senators for their support and I wish the Bill a speedy passage.

        â€”This is the second time around with this legislation, albeit in a different form from that in which it came to this House previously. The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 attempts to render invalid the health levy which was imposed by the Victorian Government in July to cover the costs of out-patient services rendered to insured patients in public hospitals in that State. The previous legislation was tacked on to another piece of legislation in the hope that it would sneak through. No announcement was made in the Budget. No warning was given. The legislation was tacked on to another health Bill, and in fact it was rejected by the Senate. The Government then saw the error of its ways and split this legislation so that it is now introduced in separate form. The Australian Labor Party still opposes the legislation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       What happens in Victoria, and what would happen in New South Wales and South Australia and what would almost certainly happen in Western Australia and Tasmania if this legislation were rejected, as it should be, is that instead of patients and hospitals having to deal with individual charges and patients when dealing with out-patients, a levy computed on the basis of membership for each fund in the State provides the funds for out-patients services. We agree with the Victorian Government that this is in fact equitable. It is an administratively simple method of funding hospital out-patients. Above all it allows the hospitals to employ healing staff, treating staff, rather than financial staff because it simplifies the system. It also eliminates lags in payments and the delays which have become increasingly important to hospitals, particularly to public hospitals, because of the parlous state of hospital finances at the moment. That is caused by the difficulties hospitals have in collecting both in-patient and out-patient funds. We have the very sad scene of hospitals in various States, because of the new health insurance system, having to employ collection agencies to try to keep their cash flow up.
      </para>
      <para>
       At least on this occasion the Government has attempted to justify its actions in this legislation in a more detailed way. But I am afraid that those sorts of arguments do not impress the Opposition. I believe that some of the arguments certainly should not impress some of the honourable senators in this place whom we have heard proclaiming States' rights in the last few weeks in so many debates on different pieces of legislation. Most of the argument used by the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) in another place and Ministers in this place has to do with the Government's almost pathological dislike of the Victorian Government and the Victorian Premier in particular. A lot of the argument is about nit picking, about the size of the levy and about the amount of money that should or would be raised by the levy. A lot of the argument is merely empty exclamations about the alleged efficiency of the Victorian Government. But the crux of the argument which the Government seems to go back to all the time is that the out-patient levy undermines the principles of user pays which is allegedly the basis on which the Government seems to hang all its health legislation in this day and age.
      </para>
      <para>
       Insured patients throughout Australia-in Victoria, South Australia and other States-in fact, in most cases, do not directly pay for their out-patient services in the manner in which the Ministers in this place and in another place seem to suggest. In most hospitals the patient signs a form and the hospital recoups the money from the relevant health fund to which the patient belongs. In South Australia a system of bulk billing applies. The hospital bulk bills the funds for the out-patient fees. We believe it is nonsense to suggest that the principle of this levy cuts across the principle of user pays at all. In any case, such an argument is irrelevant to the issue of out-patients and out- patient services. We went through all that when the legislation was previously in this place. I think it does not assist us very much in the second reading stage of this legislation to go through the long debate we had on a previous occasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       But I think it is worth while pointing out that this Government, under the new health system, has firmly and, at times, vigorously in debate in this place and in public statements pointed out that it believes that the public hospitals are the responsibilities of the State governments, having changed the funding of public hospitals to make them the responsibility of the State governments. Yet we have at least three State governments-Victoria, in particular-which have looked at the system the Government has bequeathed them and have said: 'We can now collect out-patient fees in a sensible way. We can collect them in a way which is more sensible for the patients. We can collect them in a way which is administratively more simple so that we do not have to employ so many staff in our finance and accounting departments to go through the various accounts, chase the patients and the accounts and sort out the services. We have a system which is equitable, which collects the right amount of money and which enables us to transfer staff from the accounts department to other departments of the hospital '.
      </para>
      <para>
       The State governments, having taken responsibility from the Federal Government, said: 'All right, you want us to be responsible for these hospitals. You want us to run these hospitals. You want to absolve yourself from this sort of responsibility.' The State governments came up with this system and the Federal Government said: Oh no, we cannot have you doing that because it will interfere with our friends in the health insurance funds'. Yet I am perfectly sure that my friend Senator Walters and some of the other people in this place who, for the last three weeks, have been haranguing us on this side of the House about States rights and saying what an evil thing it is for the Federal Government to interfere with the States' responsibilities will come into this place and say: ' Yes, but in this case we will do a turnover and say it is our responsibility to tell you how to collect the money in your hospitals. It is not our responsibility to give you sufficient funds for your hospitals. It is not our responsibility to tell you how many beds you should have or the distribution of those beds, but it is our responsibility to tell you how you should charge your out-patient clients in those hospitals.' I just do not see how the Government can sustain that argument at all. We believe that hospital funding is very much a national responsibility and that the Commonwealth should have some say. But, apparently, those on the Government side repeatedly say they do not believe this , except where it affects the health insurance funds, which give so much assistance to the Government during its election campaigns by way of donations, staff and advertising.
      </para>
      <para>
       I find it incredible that this legislation is back here in this form. If there is to be an argument, as there was last time, about whether the levy is too high , too low or whether the amount of funds that are collected is too high or too low, the Government should conduct it with the States. It is certainly an argument which the Victorian Government is willing to resolve through consultations with the Federal Department of Health and the Federal Government. If the argument is that the health insurance funds will be disadvantaged because they will no longer be able to sit for months on end on the moneys that are owing to the public hospitals while they go through the tortuous process of sorting out out-patients charges, the Government will have no sympathy from this side of the House. For heaven's sake, our health service problems are difficult enough. When a State government comes up with a simple, fair and sensible method of sorting out the problem which faces every public hospital in this country-the problem of sorting out how to recoup the funds which arise from the large numbers of out-patient services which are provided each year-the Government should not reject it out of hand in this way. It should not reject it for ideological reasons but try to support the States in their difficulties, which are largely created by the inefficient and insufficient funding which is provided for State hospitals under this Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       We continue to oppose this legislation. We prefer to oppose it, as we are opposing it today, in an individual piece of legislation rather than having it tacked on to another piece of legislation in an attempt to blackmail us into agreeing with it. We believe we will defeat the legislation, as we defeated it before, but we are glad that we will defeat it in the present circumstances and not under threats of blackmail as existed during the Budget debate.

        â€”The purpose of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is contained in clauses 4 and 6. It is to preclude application by any State or Territory of any tax based on health insurance. As we are well aware, the Victorian Government has levied 80c a week on every family insured by the registered health insurance funds and 40c a week on every contributor who is single. The Victorian Government has said that that is to cover outpatients' fees. As a result of that decision the health insurance funds in Victoria have had to raise their contribution costs by between 30 and 40c. We now know that the New South Wales Government has said that on 1 January it will implement a levy also. It will levy exactly the same amount as is levied in Victoria-80c a week on families and 40c a week on single people, again supposedly to cover outpatients' fees. But the New South Wales Government is doing more than that. It is also implementing past legislation and next year it will implement an additional levy of 60c a week for families and 30c a week for single people to cover ambulance costs. According to the registered health funds in New South Wales this will result in an increase in weekly contributions not of 30c to 40c but of 90c to $1. We were told by Senator Grimes today and by the Australian Democrats the last time health legislation was debated in this chamber, that this levy was to recompense the States because the Federal Government had not given them enough money to run their hospitals. Senator Chipp quoted Mr Roper, in reference to the health legislation where by the Commonwealth Government was giving the States the responsibility of running their own hospitals, as having said:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       If the Federal Government's legislation is passed it will mean a shortfall of $ 20m in the State's health funding.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us see just what these levies will raise. I find it most interesting that the Victorian Government has estimated that it will raise $44m through that levy alone. Are Senator Chipp and Senator Grimes suggesting for one moment that outpatient departments in Victorian hospitals are down the drain $44m? That is the amount that is being raised-$44m-supposedly to cover outpatient costs. By supporting this legislation, are they suggesting that $44m is the cost to Victoria for its outpatients? The whole thing is too ludicrous. That State is raising a normal tax that it can spend on roads, sporting facilities or anything it chooses. In raising that tax it is discriminating against one group of people who insure themselves in order to cover health costs. It is not imposing the tax on those who insure themselves in health organisations that are not registered- only on those who join registered health funds. A considerable number of people have insured themselves with insurance companies which are not registered health insurance funds. These people are not asked to pay the levy or to contribute to this tax. Other groups have decided to cover their own health costs. Those people will not contribute to this tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us look at the amount being raised by New South Wales. New South Wales is raising $56m in a full year for its outpatients' services. Is it suggested that it is costing New South Wales $56m for its outpatients' services? That is the amount that it is raising. It says it is raising that amount to cover outpatients' services. It is raising an additional $42m for its ambulance service. Is it suggested that all of that $98m being raised by New South Wales will be spent purely on outpatients' and ambulance services? The contributions made by people who insure themselves with registered health funds in that State will rise by 90c or $1. That is what is successfully being done. Again, the States of New South Wales and Victoria are raising taxes at the expense of people who like to insure themselves for their own health costs and look after themselves.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have heard a lot of rhetoric in the past from the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats. They have said that they are concerned that health contributions are too high for many people to pay. They have made all sorts of claims and have wept tears in this place about this situation. yet now they are voting to increase the contributions in Victoria. As I have said, the rates in that State have already been increased by 30c or 40c in order to cover this levy. An additional 90c to $1 a week is about to be raised in New South Wales early in the new year when these levies are introduced in that State. This is an absolute disgrace. It is being done for one reason only, and that is a political reason. The political reason is this: They want to scupper the health scheme that this Government has introduced. They are willing to scupper it at any cost. They are willing to put people who are paying contributions to a greater degree of hardship. They are willing to put people in New South Wales into a situation where they will pay an additional $52 a year. Let it be clearly understood that the Labor Party and the Democrats are voting to put up the contribution rates in New South Wales by $52 a year. They have already voted to put up the contributions-

        â€”We are well aware that the Opposition is not very keen for these simple facts to be put across. The facts are easy to put across and easy for the people to understand. The increase in health contribution rates next year in New South Wales will be a direct result of the Labor Opposition and the Australian Democrats voting for a Bill to allow that State to increase the contribution rates by $1 for a family. I do not want to hear any more talk in the Senate that they believe that the contribution rates are too high. They will clearly raise them by their vote today. They are clearly raising the contribution rate by $1 a family and I want it clearly understood that there is no other reason for the rise in the contribution rates next year. One wonders when South Australia, the other Labor run State, will join Victoria and New South Wales, because no doubt it will. It will see that there is a nice way of getting a tax which amounts in Victoria to $44m and in New South Wales to $98m and getting it in such a way that the people are not aware that it is being raised. The people in Victoria and New South Wales will look at their contribution increase and say: 'The funds have put up the rates again'. They will not say: 'This rise is the result of the levy put on by the State Government', not unless it is clearly put across to them. The people will be accusing the funds of putting up the rates, not the two States.

      <para>
       There is no guarantee at all in the States' legislation that the money so raised will be used for health costs. I would like the Democrats to understand that very clearly. There is no legislation in those States which will ensure that that money will be used for health costs. The States can build roads with it, they can build sporting facilities, they can do as they like with it. They do not have to use it for health funds. They put this tax on a group of people who care to insure themselves for their health costs; not, as I have said, on those people who ensure themselves for health costs in outside areas but only on those who insure themselves with the registered funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Democrats have just opposed a federal tax-raising Bill, the Bank Account Debits Tax Administration Bill. They are not opposing the States receiving this money, even though it is far more discriminatory. During the last debate the Democrats likened this Bill in a most incredible way, to Queensland running the Golden Casket lotteries. I cannot imagine anything more ludicrous, but that is the standard of debate that we are used to from the Democrats. The Democrats say that the tax raised by the levy will be at the expense of only the people who are insured against health costs, except the pensioners and the low income earners. Senator Chipp is pointing to the time. I thought I would be speaking for only 10 minutes, but I have had points of order taken against me-not by Senator Chipp but by the Opposition-and my time wasted. I intend to finish what I am saying. I stress again that it is the group of people who are insured with the unregistered health funds and who carry their own insurance who will not be paying this tax. Senator Grimes talked about States rights and Senator Macklin asked whether I was denying States rights. All States in this country have the right to raise additional taxes. I do not believe they have the right to raise taxes in such a discriminatory fashion. I do not believe they can say to one group of people: 'We want $44m from Victoria and $98m from New South Wales, but we are going to tax only one section of the community. We intend to tax only those people who are willing to look after themselves. We will not tax the others in any way'. This is a discriminatory tax. It is not an honest tax because it has been disguised, it is a political act against the health scheme that this Government has put up.
      </para>
      <para>
       I said that I would speak for only 10 minutes but roughly five minutes of my time was taken up by interjections and points of order. I will leave the rest of my remarks. This legislation has been debated twice already in this place. If this Bill is not passed by the Senate, every time a member of the Opposition says in this place that people cannot afford their health contributions and whenever the Democrats weep tears of blood because the contributions are too high, we will remind them that they were responsible for raising the contribution rates in both New South Wales and Victoria. The contributors to funds in those States will be reminded that it was not the funds but the States which raised those rates.

        â€”The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1982 presents to the Senate for the second time a proposition which the Senate has previously rejected. It was rejected because a majority of honourable senators believed it was unjust, that it intruded on States rights and that the system proposed to be introduced by Mr John Cain and now by Mr Neville Wran is a better system. I find it an amazing incongruity that that self-appointed champion of States rights, Senator Walters, should be saying: 'Look, Mr Carlton, Federal Minister for Health, it is perfectly all right for you to go to Victoria and tell Mr John Cain, the State Premier, how to run his health service'. It is incongruity at its most ludicrous , particularly in view of the 14 hours of sanctimonious protesting about infringements of States rights that we heard here this week and last week over the Franklin River. In effect, Senator Walters is saying: 'It is all right to interfere with the way in which the health scheme in Victoria is run, and it is also all right to allow a dam to be built in Tasmania'. My mind is not capable of comprehending such breathtaking logic.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       What we are debating today is a proposition put forward by Mr John Cain and now I believe by Mr Neville Wran. No doubt it will be followed, as Senator Walters accurately predicts, by all the other States in the near future. It is a most sensible proposition. That is why the Australian Democrats are opposing this Bill. We oppose it not because of any nonsense about States rights but simply because what Mr Cain proposes makes absolute good sense. Let me briefly explain the legislation as I understand it. It deals with out-patients in public hospitals. Under the old system those who attended an out-patients department at a public hospital were charged $20 for each treatment. They has to pay the $20 in cash and then collect a proportion of that sum from their health funds. One could imagine the number of pieces of paper and the amount of clerical work involved. About four different transactions would be involved. The alternative is that the patient, after receiving a bill for $20 from the hospital, could then go to a health fund, fill in an application form, receive reimbursement and then send that cheque-it would probably amount to about 80 per cent of the $20- plus his own cheque to the hospital. The hospital then has to receive it, open the envelope and issue and post out the receipt. Seven or eight transactions would be involved. That was the old system.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new system that Mr John Cain and Mr Laurie Brereton want to introduce simplifies that procedure. From now on they want out-patient services to be free but in order to reimburse the hospitals for those costs a levy should be imposed on the health funds. The theory is that instead of the health funds being billed bit by bit for hundreds of thousands of patients a year-there would be a plethora of clerical work, expenses and whatever-it would be done in one fell swoop. If Senator Walters or the Government want to argue that a levy of 80c a family or 40c a single person is too high, I would regard that as a reasonable argument. I am prepared to hear arguments on that point of view. Maybe a fairer charge would be 60c for a family and 30c for a single person. I do not know. I do not have the figures.
      </para>
      <para>
       What we are arguing today is the principle that what is involved here is a simplification of the health system operating in the States. Various State governments have recognised this as a way to economise, a way in which they can reduce administrative costs and redirect the staff resources and funds available to higher priority areas. As a former management consultant, I am appalled every time I walk into a public hospital at the inefficiencies and the waste of money. I would think that Senator Walters would be equally appalled; I know that her husband is in the medical profession.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think politicians of all political complexions for years have been searching for a way to improve efficiency in hospitals in an endeavour to save this massive bill on the public purse. One State Minister believes he has found a way . As a former management consultant, I can see the wisdom in what the Victorian Government is doing. The Federal Government which is supposed to champion States rights is saying: 'We, from this ivory tower in Canberra which has a monopoly on all wisdom, say to you, John Cain, that you should not collect the fees for out- patient charges in the way you wish. You will do it our way, the federal way'. Mr Carlton, for whom I have an unbounded admiration as a person and as a Minister, has given reasons why we should oppose this levy.
      </para>
      <para>
       In a strange sentence the Minister for Health said that the levy goes directly against the Commonwealth's commitment to health services based on the 'user pays ' principle. If someone one day were to explain to me that the Government embraces the user pays principle uniformly I would be delighted. I believe it is almost putting a principle to the point of absurdity to say: 'We believe in the user pays principle', when we look at the hundreds of thousands of examples where the principle is abrogated. Mr Carlton also said that an essential element of health cost containment is that people be aware of the costs of medical treatments and this will not occur if insured out-patients make no direct payments to hospitals. I take that point, and I agree with it. I agree that it is an argument but I believe that the weight of argument is on the other side. The Minister also opposed the levy because he said that the lack of direct payments by insured out-patients would lead to an unwarranted increase in the use of those services. I am not persuaded to that view. The Minister should have given evidence that this was the case when he made that assertion. To my knowledge no such evidence has been produced.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally-I think this is the crux of the matter-the Minister, who is an honest man, said that it would be possible for State governments to introduce general levies on funds for in-patient services, thus introducing an Australian Labor Party-type nationalised health scheme through the backdoor. If Senator Walters had had the time today she would have gone into that aspect because she is a champion of the private health scheme and is against a nationalised health scheme. I join with her. She and I used to fight battles, if her memory stretches back that far, back to 1975, when we were once in the same political party, against efforts to nationalise the health scheme. She would not have an enemy in me there. But as I understand it, the nub of this matter is a fear of the Liberal Party of the thin end of the wedge to a nationalised health scheme. Again I commend the Minister for his honesty in saying that that is the thrust of this legislation. But I reject the point that that is the thin end of the wedge to a nationalised health scheme.

        â€”I believe the Labor Party again has been very honest in this matter. It has set out its health scheme; it is there on paper. It would be anathema to the Liberal Party and it would disagree with it. I believe that the Labor Party has been honest as well in stating what its health policy is. Of course, this is a proposition which fits snugly into that health policy. What the Minister is talking about is that this is the thin end of the wedge to a nationalised health scheme. I think that really is a load of rubbish. For those reasons the Australian Democrats join with the Labor Party in opposing this legislation.

        â€”in reply- From what Senator Chipp and Opposition senators have said the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1982 will not receive a second reading. I therefore want to make a few comments. First, I wish to make it clear that the Government has constitutional responsibility for health insurance. Section 51 placitum (xxiiiA) contains the words 'sickness and hospital benefits'. This is an area of Commonwealth responsibility and it is an area where the Commonwealth has a proper desire to protect the interests of Australians. Health insurance is a Commonwealth matter. This Bill seeks to protect contributors to health insurance . My colleague Senator Walters made this quite clear in her contribution. What we are trying to protect them against is a selective tax which is being proposed and imposed by two States under Labor control. The failure to pass this Bill will mean higher health insurance premiums for Australian people in Victoria and New South Wales. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats by opposing this Bill are voting to ensure higher health insurance premiums for Australians in two large States. This Bill, if passed, will enable premiums to be reduced. That is the crux of the matter.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       People listening to this debate should understand that their interests are being put at risk. If this Bill is passed their health insurance payments will be lower. If this Bill is rejected their health insurance payments will be higher. They will have the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats to thank when they have a higher than necessary health insurance Bill. I am grateful to Senator Walters for having made that point clear. That is the undoubted effect that will flow from the Labor Party vote. Labor senators are voting for higher health insurance today and the Australian Democrats are with them. It is not only a higher impost but also one that is quite significant in the way in which it will increase. The New South Wales Government has not only introduced an impost but also has indexed it to changes in prices irrespective of how costs move in hospitals and irrespective of usage. It is indexed to the consumer price index and the impost on contributors to health insurance funds will increase inexorably. I notice that the Australian Democrats are supporting the Labor Party in this matter. I cannot but be reminded of a statement made by Senator Chipp to the National Press Club on 29 July 1981 when he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Fortuitously, the ideas of the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party on social and legal and constitutional and electoral reform are almost indistinguishable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Well, they certainly are. We know from the way in which divisions in this place go and from the voting record in divisions that that is the case. The Australian Democrats divide with the Australian Labor Party most of the time. They vote against revenue proposals to enable the Government to do its job and they vote for most proposals to increase expenditure. On this occasion at least, they are voting for a measure which will increase an impost upon Australian citizens and they are voting against a measure which will protect contributors and keep costs down. There is no way the Labor Party can get away from the consequence of what it is doing.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the previous debate, I have set out the reasons why we thought these proposals should not be rejected. Senator Chipp was inaccurate when he said they were rejected by a majority in the Senate. They were not. There was an equality of voting. That is a small point. Senator Chipp might as well be accurate in what he said. There was not a majority against this proposal, but the rules of the Senate meant that the Bill failed. So be it. I do not object to that.

He can go home and explain to people the effect of his vote. Honourable senators opposite have been talking about State rights. They oppose State rights on the question of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill and they oppose State rights where there is some doubt that the Commonwealth has the responsibility and power to move as they suggested, and they espouse State rights in an area of clear Commonwealth responsibility. The Commonwealth clearly has the responsibility to look after health insurance. Honourable members opposite are trying to prevent the Commonwealth from carrying out what it is required to do.

       It has been an interesting week. At the beginning of Senator Chipp's speech we had a reference to the debate on the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill which has been passed. I have only one comment to make on that matter. At the National Press Club on 29 July 1981, Senator Chipp said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . there'll be no gags in future in the Senate . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       On 9 December 1982, Senator Chipp voted for the gag five times. In July 1981, he said: 'There will be no gags'. On 9 December 1982, he voted for five gags and on 13 December he voted for one more. I suppose we should be grateful for the fact that there was 16 months between his statement and its betrayal. But, after all, Senator Chipp did come here to teach us how to be honest and to keep us honest in the eyes of the electorate.

        â€”The Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill has two main purposes. Firstly, it provides for the disqualification from holding office in an organisation of persons convicted of certain prescribed offences subject to an appeal. Secondly, it provides for organisations to abide by certain rules as to the making of loans and, in particular, for the disclosure of loans and donations by trade unions and trade union officials. The Bill represents yet another contribution of this Government in the field of industrial relations. Not many of the contributions which this Government has made in the past seven years have been very distinguished ones. This Bill will not alter the pattern at all. I want to say at the outset that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. We see some value in it. Some honourable senators, one in particular, might be surprised to hear that we do not oppose the clause relating to disclosures of donations. That is not a matter which trade unions or the Australian Labor Party , which are sometimes the recipients of those donations, have ever sought to hide. We welcome those provisions and we will not oppose them.

      <para>
       I want to talk briefly about the history of this Government in relation to industrial relations matters because it has not been a particularly happy history. There are many reasons for that which lie deep in the ideology of the Liberal Party. This Government has constantly sought to pursue in its industrial relations policies an element of confrontation and a great deal of chest beating about the demons, if you like, that exist in the industrial relations field. The Fraser Government seems to think that if there is some problem in industrial relations that it wants to overcome it need only legislate and everything will be better. The Government has legislated in this area some 15 times since it came to power as a government; yet it still complains--

        â€”Yes, we have helped the Government to legislate; yet it still complains. I would have thought that that scarcely represents success. This approach ignores the very fundamental truth that good industrial relations are achieved, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) once said when he was the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, through co-operation and consultation and not with the heavy-handed approach to which government is sometimes addicted and to which this Government is particularly addicted. Let us not be fooled by this legislation. It has the traditional ad hoc gimmickry approach that characterises the legislation of this Government in industrial relations matters. There is no better evidence of that fact than the statement by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) in his second reading speech that the legislation was inspired largely by the Winneke Royal Commission on the Activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation.

       The political background to the Bill is that the Government has tried to make a bit of capital out of problems in the industrial relations arena. The Senate will be mindful of the inquiry into the Builders Labourers Federation and of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which backfired a bit in terms of its intended purpose. Perhaps it is desirable in that context that the Government should use this to try to recover some ground. What has really happened is that the new Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has had to throw a sort of ideological bone to certain elements of the Liberal Party to satisfy--

       I turn to some of the particular objections to the Bill. It is a bad Bill in terms of drafting and so on. It is not well thought out-surprise, surprise! The first point I want to make concerns consistency. By way of introduction we are told that this Bill is aimed at putting companies and trade unions-corporations of capital and corporations of labour-on the same sort of footing. Let us look at the success of that. I refer to the legislation itself, which proceeds on the assumption that there is in fact some sort of basic similarity between trade unions and corporate organisations in terms of financial capacities. The Minister for National Development and Energy made reference in his second reading speech to provisions in the national companies leglislation which place obligations on company directors. It is not true at all to say that trade unions and companies are in a similar position in relation to those matters.

        â€”They are in a similar position in relation to the consequences of the activities of both corporations. I agree with that proposition, if that is what is being put by way of interjection. The functions of company directors are not the same as the functions of trade union officials in any sense, particularly if a company director is running a $10 shelf company or something. The corporate veil is used for very strange purposes sometimes. The penalties provided for that and the administration of that process are not very well carried out. Company directors and officers of companies often have fiduciary duties and obligations to shareholders which are not like those of trade union officials. The concept of a limited liability for a company and the responsibilities which directors have to shareholders ensure that there should be a different standard of conduct for those persons than for union officials.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I make the point that it is quite untrue to say that the obligations imposed on officials of industrial organisations by this Bill are the same as those currently imposed on company directors. An examination of the provisions of the Bill indicates that the obligations are likely to be much more onerous than those imposed on company officials by section 227 and section 562 of the Companies Act 1981. I make the point by referring to a number of matters in proposed new section 132F of the Bill which provides that one of the prescribed offences which could lead to disqualification is:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . an offence involving the intentional or reckless use of violence towards another person, the intentional or reckless causing of death or injury to another person or the intentional or reckless damaging or destruction of property.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not know what that means. Perhaps the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) can help us later on by telling us what it means. The use of the word ' reckless' in relation to a union official, meaning reprehensible conduct punishable by provisions under this Bill, has no counterpart in company legislation. No company director can possibly commit an offence under the Companies Act which is described as recklessness in the generality embraced by that expression. The word 'reckless' in this legislation could cover a wide range of situations which would not ordinarily be thought to constitute behaviour which should disqualify somebody from holding office in a company or anywhere else. For example, one can be guilty of an offence under the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act or the Crimes Act involving the use of a motor vehicle which is attributable to recklessness in the course of one's employment. This clearly falls within the provisions of this proposed new section. As a result of that a union official under this legislation could be disqualified from holding office.

        â€”Recklessness while drunk, shall we put it that way, Senator? That is the consequence of this Bill. It is either a very bad piece of drafting or a quite discriminatory and unfair provision. I draw the attention of the Senate to that. I must say that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, in explaining that clause in the House of Representatives, said that the courts would be expected to grapple with these issues in a sensible way. That might be so but it is not how one deals with legislation or puts some popularly conceived demon such as Norman Gallagher into the dock to face a drunk driving charge, saying to the courts: 'You have to be very careful about this fellow because he is a union official and if you convict him he might lose his job'. That is not fair. It is an aspect of this legislation that is wrong. One hopes that the Government will re-examine that provision and ensure that it is amended or interpreted in such a way as to be satisfactory, otherwise justice will not be done.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The second important point that I would like to make about the legislation is that if a union official has been convicted of a prescribed offence under it and subsequently goes to the court and says, 'I want to stand as a candidate in a union election', then obtains permission from the court to stand, as the Bill would allow him to do, obviously that is not fair under the democratic process. As a candidate he is under a cloud from the start in contesting an election. He is the mendicant candidate, the one who has been to court and been told, 'In spite of your grave errors of character'-or whatever has been found by the court -'when you behaved carelessly,'-or something of the sort-'you are entitled to be a candidate'. That represents a severe intrusion upon the democratic process. In view of the way in which the Bill is structured I do not know how one is to solve that problem, what one does by way of an alternative, but I wonder whether that provision has been thought through. The potential for suffering severe disadvantage is present there.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, there is no real parallel in the Companies Act because company directors do not normally stand for election. Another minor point of difference is that the companies legislation probably applies only to offences committed within Australia, whereas the provisions of this Bill apply to offences committed ' under a law of the Commonwealth of a State, of a Territory or of another country '. I do not know why that language has been inserted. Perhaps the Minister will explain it to us later, but it is not on all fours with normal legislation of this kind and one wonders why it is there.
      </para>
      <para>
       The principal objection that the Opposition has to the Bill-I wish to confine my remarks as much as possible-concerns paragraph (b) of proposed new section 132F (1). That provision sets out as prescribed offences the offences listed under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the regulations made thereunder. That really involves double jeopardy for officials who are caught up by its provisions. The point is that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act already provides penalties in respect of offences listed in that Act. In a sense people who are caught up by the provisions of this legislation will have to be dealt with twice for the same offence. It seems to the Opposition to be very strange that a trade union official who has been punished under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should then suffer the additional penalty of being disqualified from holding office under this Bill. The Government really cannot have it both ways in respect of that offence. It is really a matter of beating the cat too much.

        â€”No, it is not. First, the range of offences here is considerably wider than it is under the Companies Act. If one is convicted, under the Companies Act provision, of an offence prescribed by that Act the pattern of disqualification is not the same as for the offences listed under that Act. They are the same here; they are identical. Double jeopardy is built into the legislation. This is an Act which operates in respect of trade unions for which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act already provides penalties for officials for a prescribed class of offence. The same class is prescribed here. A person is punished under an Act specifically for the purpose of dealing with trade unions and is again eventually dealt with under these provisions by losing his job.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I make one other point. A union official might be put in a quite impossible position by this clause. An offence under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act may have been committed in the course of carrying out one's duty as a union official. A committee of management, for example, may have instructed a person to perform certain actions which would result in a breach of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Should a union official obey the instructions of his committee of managment which might lead to a breach of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or should he disregard that directive? If he went ahead he would suffer a penalty under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and, in addition, find himself disqualified from holding office in a union by virtue of the provisions of this Bill. There is no justification for imposing double penalties in this way and the Opposition intends to move an amendment at the Committee stage of the debate in relation to that matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final matter I want to mention is the disclosure provisions. This legislation provides for disclosure in respect of grants or loans to anyone or to any organisation, not just an officer or member of a union. The Opposition is not opposed to public disclosure of loans, grants or gifts which are made by trade unions or trade union officials to organisations or persons. There should be public disclosure of those things. For a long time we have said that there should be public disclosure provisions in relation to both companies and trade unions. Part of the national policy of the Opposition is that there should be public disclosure. What harm can be done to a society by seeing what donations are given to particular organisations by other organisations? People do not have to make donations if they do not want them to be disclosed. We say that the provisions relating to disqualification of officials are similar to corporate provisions. If the Government insists on that it should admit that there is an overwhelming case for extending disclosure provisions to companies as well. For example, if a particular trade union gives the Australian Labor Party $10,000 for an election we see no objection to that being publicly disclosed. It should be publicly disclosed. The same rule should apply to companies which give the Labor Party or the Liberal Party $10,000 for an election. If we are talking about equality of principle between companies and the trade union movement we have to be fair dinkum about that too. The same standards should apply.

However, there is no hesitation at all about disclosing donations given to us by trade unions. If the rules applied with equality across the board we would not worry about donations given to us by companies either. We should not worry about them and neither should the Liberal Party. It may mean that both parties have less money because people may not want to give if their donations have to be disclosed. But when one is operating as a public organisation, such as a political party, there is no reason why there should not be complete and frank disclosure. People can then draw their own conclusions from anything which may follow, as Senator Peter Baume did, with great vehemence, when he discovered that the Victorian Secondary Teachers Association gave a big donation to the Labor Party in Victoria at the last State election.

The Opposition calls upon the Government to follow the force of that argument for public disclosure right through and apply the disclosure provisions to companies as well as trade unions. That should be done. Otherwise, what seems to be the rationale of the Government's approach in this legislation-namely, that the same sort of rules should apply to trade unions as apply to companies-is just not true. The Government does not believe that at all; it believes that only when it suits it to do so. It is a piece of legislative and political hypocrisy which is a quite extraordinary justification for legislation. I now turn to the Opposition's second reading amendment. The most outrageous thing has just occurred. Somebody has passed me a note saying that this is a long 10 minutes. What an extraordinary thing to say!

I will not go into the history of the Bill because that is well known. Nor do I wish to go into the detailed provisions of the Bill because they too are fairly well known. Suffice it to say that as far as we can see this Bill will do absolutely nothing for industrial relations in this country.

       I wish to confine my further comments to the various amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party. The Opposition first wishes to remove sub-clause 132F (1 ) (b). It claims that this sub-clause represents a double jeopardy in that people convicted of an offence under certain sections of various Acts named in the legislation could be subject to a second penalty. Exactly, the same situation applies to company directors who may be convicted of fraud and fined and who may also be debarred from remaining as company directors. If it is good enough for company directors it seems to us to be good enough for union officials. I was not persuaded by the comments of Senator Button in this area.

       So we will not be supporting the Labor Party's amendment at the second reading stage. We will be happy, however, to support the Opposition's second reading amendment. I wish to observe briefly that it is a pity that both major political parties do not follow the practice of the Australian Democrats in identifying major donors to political parties. I am sure that we would all be much wiser if they did that. I was intrigued by the wording of the Labor Party's amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time, which, in part, states:

       Senator Button did not make it clear to me whether that principle would be applied to donations to political parties. I gathered that he was in agreement with that principle. I only hope that when the Australian Labor Party forms a government in the foreseeable future it will adopt that principle and legislate for the public disclosure of donations to political parties.

That would be, as far as I am concerned, one enormous step forward in bringing Australian politics to a different level altogether. At present our political system is wide open to legal political blackmail. There is no other word for it. Companies-many of them multinational companies-with millions of dollars to be gained by government favours can legally make multimillion dollar donations to political parties without disclosing that they are doing it. If that is not political blackmail, I do not know what is. If we achieve nothing else in the next few years but the public disclosure of funds to political parties we will have advanced the political process in this country. That is good news from our point of view.

       I conclude by stating that under this Bill union officials who are convicted of offences will be disqualified for five years only. That does not seem to me to be unreasonable. When this Bill was first mooted in the Press there was talk about disqualification for extended periods. It was argued that officials who, in their youth, may have been convicted for an offence such as pinching some fruit from a neighbour's fruit tree would be excluded from holding office because of that offence committed maybe 40 years ago. I was pleased to see that that provision did not appear in the legislation. We support the legislation. We wholeheartedly support the Labor Party's second reading amendment. We will not support its amendment at the Committee stage.

        â€” I support the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill which relates to an important area of industrial relations; that is, federally registered organisations which apply both to employers and employees. Before I speak to the Bill I should like to take a moment to comment on the contributions to this debate made by Senator Button and Senator Siddons. I looked forward with some pleasure to hearing Senator Button, but unfortunately I did not think he spent much time preparing his speech. His speech had so little factual comment and critical appraisal of the Bill that his 27 minute speech could have been reduced to a 10 minute speech. I will pick up a couple of points he made. I do not agree with the Australian Democrats approach that this Bill does nothing for industrial relations. I think it shows a lack of understanding of the Bill. The Bill is not universally applicable to everyday events. To claim that it is purely for political capital is to show a lack of understanding of what has gone on in Australian industrial relations over recent times.

       The matter of donations to party funds really is a red herring. We have a belief in this country that people are entitled to the privacy of the ballot box . We do not have public voting, except in some union affairs and so on where people are subject to intimidation. We believe that all the governments of Australia are elected by secret ballot, and it is a quite logical extension of that basic right that people should be entitled to support the political party of their choice without being criticised or investigated by their political opponents. That is a principle which I am happy to defend at any time. This is dealt with quite ethically and adequately in the Liberal Party of Australia by a separation of the fund raising functions within the organisational wing from those of the political wing.

It relates to both employers and employees. It is very important to stress that it relates to the employers. Listening to Senator Button, one would think that it is applicable purely to employees, but that is not so; it covers the employers. They are both dealt with equally under the legislation.

       There are two broad areas of concern. The first area deals with the fitness of office-holders to hold office in organisations, or those individuals who aspire to office. The second broad area relates to the use of the financial resources of the organisations with respect to making loans, grants and donations. As to the fitness of office-holders, this is quite a reasonable position to adopt having regard to the position of national importance of office-bearers in these organisations. Similar restrictions or even more stringent restrictions apply in some professional and commercial fields where people similarly have positions of trust and responsibility.

       The provisions set out to combat corruption. The Government is trying to ensure a higher standard of integrity-not that the assertion is that union officials, by and large, are corrupt; they are certainly not corrupt. The overwhelming majority of them are absolutely honest. But in any bureaucracy-when I use the word 'bureaucracy' in this sense I am not talking about the Public Service-in any big organisation, there is always the possibility of the abuse of power. This is one legislative way of trying to control abuses of power, particularly where they get into the fields of criminal corruption.

       One has to look only at the present structure of Russian society today, in which there is no legislation similar to this, and to talk to people with some knowledge of it to learn of the extent of corruption which apparently now is right through the whole of Russian society, both horizontally and vertically. The provisions are not a prohibition on people who have a criminal record from being office-holders. They can have served their sentence and paid their debts to society, but the requirement is that they must be separated from the event by a period of five years, either the event which led to their conviction or five years after they have served their sentence; so in that sense it does not abridge in any way their human rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second point of the legislation deals with the accountability of the disbursement of funds. This is something about which the debate so far has occasioned most comment. Briefly, the Bill provides that there must not be a decision made by one person or by two or three people in the organisation but by the whole of the management committee; and secondly, there must be provisions for proper repayment. It is designed to prevent loans to relatives or friends, or to prevent donations masquerading as loans, by the requirement that there be adequate repayment facilities. As I have said, there has been great opposition to this. Frankly, it is nonsense. It simply relates to the proviso of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, in Part VIIIAA as it currently stands, and its supporting regulations, which cover all loans, grants and donations over $1,000. That was the recommendation of the National Labor Consultative Council, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions accepted that recommendation. There is no requirement to publish those donations. It is just that they must be within the records of the body approved by the management committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is important to emphasise that this is not anti-union legislation. It applies both to employer and to employee bodies. It is fair legislation, because it protects the vast majority of honest people in both categories from the excesses of a few dishonest individuals. There is no need at all for groups to feel victimised or that they are being placed-without trial-in a category of untrustworthiness with respect to society. After all, managers and company directors, as Senator Siddons has said, accept the provision of the Companies Act which covers their behaviour even though most of them are in ethical companies. But there are also those in the small companies such as the $2 companies which have an horrendous history of failure and, quite frankly, fraud.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is equally important to realise that the Government does not expect these provisions to be widely used. That is a point I made right at the outset. This is very narrow legislation which will be applied on very infrequent occasions because the great majority of unions and employer groups are absolutely honest. But everyone knows the problems we have had in recent times with the Builders Labourers Federation and the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia. Quite simply, some unions are not whiter than white. That is the reason for this legislation-to control the few who behave in a criminal way.

       Senator Button had quite a bit to say about comparisons with the Companies Act. I do not wish to go down that path because I think it is rather irrelevant to the furtherance of this debate. I would like to talk briefly about offences that will be provided for under this Act and under the provisions of proposed new section 132F (1) (b) which describes the offences. Broadly, they are: Fraud or dishonesty under Commonwealth, State and Territory laws; offences in connection with management problems; and the final one about which Senator Button was so concerned, which is 'the intentional or reckless use of violence'. Senator Button made the case that a motor accident could debar someone from being an office holder. That is simple a facile and incorrect interpretation of the provision. Intentional or reckless use of violence has to be proved. The history of a few unions shows that violence and intimidation have been used to enforce union policy. As a layman I think it would probably be very difficult to prove before a court of law that that violence was intentional. Far from being a stringent requirement, I think the law is rather weak in that we will probably have great difficulty in satisfying a judge or the courts that violence was intentional even though someone might be very badly beaten up or injured. The old story of accidents happening and no one knowing what happened and no one seeing what happened is all too prevalent. Certainly, this legislation is designed to ban those who, in general terms, are unfit to hold office. It is designed quite clearly to protect the organisations from corrupt officials but it is not designed in any way at all to ruin the careers of otherwise impeccable officials.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion I say that the Act will not have great application. It has become necessary only because of the abuses of power by several unions in the country and the potential, presumably, of other groups to flaunt the law with respect to people's rights. The legislation is not discriminatory in any sense at all between the employer and the employee. It is not anti-union in any sense. It is designed to protect the members of the organisations from a few unscrupulous officials. It is fairly drafted and it is really about accountability for office holders.

        â€”In joining in this debate on the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill 1982, I commend my Leader, Senator Button, who in his usual way gave a lucid explanation of the legal implications of the Bill. I raise a question of practical trade unionism. I have listened to Government speakers. I was fortified by the remarks of our industrial relations spokesman in the other place, the honourable member for Wills, Mr Robert Hawke, in relation to the capacity of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to put its own house in order . The unions named in the legislation are a very minute section of the trade union movement. Even Senator MacGibbon has conceded that the vast majority of trade union officers do a very onerous job under tremendous pressure. I could reflect on some of the aspects of the Builders Labourers Federation or the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, but I hasten to say that although I may differ with some of the trade union officials in my State-I know Senator Childs will agree with me-they are honest. I refer particularly to Izzy Wyner, the Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. He goes to ACTU Labour Council of Australia and Australian Labor Party conferences. He does not often get his way but he fights on, and he is a very honest man.

There have been cases of bad apples. In the 1950s, when the bus union had lifetime appointments, an official of the union named Bagnall died prematurely-at 47 years of age-and it was found that he had union money mixed up with his own. The union changed its rules and introduced triennial elections. That was its prerogative. The United Kingdom still has not learnt its lesson in relation to security. If one goes to Cambridge or Oxford, one can get away with treason, but if one is from the north of England and has a working class background, one is out on one's bum quickly if one breaks foreign affairs law. Those are the double standards. I know men like Gordon McIntosh say 'Amen' to that.

In my own State, a prominent official of the Rural Bank of New South Wales was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years for diddling society by misappropriation of certain funds. I fortify what Senator Button has said on the legal side of this Bill and unions putting their house in order. Perhaps I can give an example of the complications for a trade union. Sometimes, if a union's leadership goes astray, the rank and file adjust it. Last night-I do not want to offend my Deputy Leader-I referred to a very fine publication on the history of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia.

The South Coast branch of the Federated Ironworkers Association is well to the left of the national officers, but that problem was dealt with within the union. Nobody had to go to court. Probably the union is all the more healthy for that when Lelli and others put their points of view at the national conference. So many people believe the state can intervene in trade unionism but not in board room battles. These are the problems that are faced today, and the double standard is resented. I think the judiciary should have moved a lot quicker to extinguish the fire in the demarcation dispute at the Omega navigational site in which members of the Builders Labourers Federation were opposed to the FIA and the Australian Workers Union.

       Sometimes there is State rivalry, regional rivalry and occupational rivalry. I think Senator Childs will agree with me that a trade union official finds it fairly hard to take a stance without first assessing the feelings of the rank and file. After all, for the last ten years editorials and all the pseudo- industrial knowhow on this side and the Government side of the chamber have harped on the rank and file, as though every paid official is being got at. That is just the point. We have inculcated the idea that Jack is as good as his master-that is a lovely term-but sometimes the paid officials know a little more . I can assure the Senate that those officials are hindered by members of the rank and file who do not want to be paid officials, but who like to snipe at the officials. That is why they have to hasten slowly before getting to the party.

       They are the real difficulties that the trade union movement has inherited. I suppose it all started with the film starring Marlon Brando entitled On the Waterfront. It gave the impression that every union official was got at. Honourable senators opposite have said about trade unions: 'Get together with the boss and everything will be right'. Sure, we have to have talk around the table, but if a person goes to too many dinners and drinks too many red wines or white wines, that is when seduction can occur in relation to ideas. That is what I always believe. I know that Senator Childs will agree with me that a person has to keep away from such situations. The moment a person declines to participate he is told that he is anti-social. He has to walk a tightrope. I simply say this: The reality of industrial affairs today is that there is always that danger of being enticed into something, into having too many white wines or too many red wines. For all we know the boss could be operating a tape recorder and could play back the tape. These are the things that we have to watch for.

       I know that people say that I am too suspicious, but a person needs to be like the dingo in the morning. The dingo walks out in the morning and sniffs the air. He knows a human scent. That is what trade union people have to do. I conclude on this note: I think that in the future Senator Evans will be able to be equated with Senator Robert Kennedy, a dedicated Attorney-General. Senator Kennedy was determined that he would get Jimmy Hoffa. He never got him and neither did his successor. The Teamsters Union does not square up to what I believe in. It does not have socialist objectives; it is a private enterprise organisation. None of my trade union colleagues believe in the private enterprise sentiments of the Teamsters Union. Would any honourable senator on the Government side of the chamber say that the Teamsters Union is an honest union? They know that it is not. To make the message quite clear, we have distinct reservations about the legislation. We believe that the trade union movement is capable of clearing out its own bad apples. There is no need for Federal intervention. Honourable senators opposite may still say that there is. I had better conclude my remarks. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is looking at me. He knows that I have set a litmus test for honourable senators opposite.

        â€”I thank honourable senators for their support of the Conciliation and Arbitration ( Management Organizations) Amendment Bill and I thank Senator Mulvihill for making the debate interesting. I shall be brief because honourable senators have co-operated in our attempts to meet a fairly heavy legislative program today. The Bill touches on two areas: First the fitness for office of officers of an organisation or of individuals who aspire to office and; secondly, the use of financial resources of organisations to make loans, grants or donations. As is fully set out in the second reading speech, the matters which have been brought before the Parliament in this Bill largely arise out of recommendations which were made by the Winneke Royal Commission into the Activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation. They are matters which have been picked up and developed by the Government, for which we now seek the Senate's approval.

       There is nothing unusual in having disqualification provisions which render people ineligible for office even though they might have committed an offence which is extraneous to that office. All honourable senators in this place are subject to the provisions of the Australian Constitution. Clause 44 of the Constitution ensures that all honourable senators are incapable of remaining members of the Senate if convicted of, or under sentence or subject to be sentenced for any offence punishable under the law by imprisonment for one year or longer. The broad principle that with respect to elected office there should be some requirement of fitness for office is one which applies equally in this place and elsewhere.

       Reference has been made to the companies legislation. This legislation, of course, borrows heavily from the existing provisions of the uniform Companies Act which disqualify company directors from acting as directors for a variety of reasons. Section 227 of the uniform Companies Act sets out various classes of offences which will give rise to disqualification of directors. I note that one of the paragraphs of that section relates to indictment for any offence in connection with the promotion, formation or management of a corporation.

       It is inherent in this legislation, as it is in the companies legislation and the constitutional provision, that there is an element of double jeopardy. People commit or may commit offences which render them liable to punishment. They are subsequently liable to the second punishment of disqualification from office. The element of double jeopardy about which some honourable senators have expressed concern is inherent in any proposal of this sort and is not a fundamental objection.

       The more serious objection which is advanced by the Opposition-although it says that it supports the legislation, notwithstanding the defects about which it complains-which it has made the subject of an amendment it has moved to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, is that the legislation is not even- handed in that there is not a requirement for disclosure of donations by companies, which are, of course, able to make donations of a political nature without disclosure. I have already said that there is a heavy reliance upon the companies legislation as a model for this legislation.

       The matter which is raised by the amendment which has been moved by Senator Button was raised in the other place. Consequent upon it being raised the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee), pursuant to an undertaking which he gave in the House of Representatives, has written to the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) and raised with him the question of bringing the companies legislation into line with the legislation which is presently before the Senate. In his letter to the Acting Attorney-General, Mr Macphee pointed out that this Bill, among other things, requires three things: That the rules of registered employee and employer organisations or their branches provide for the committee of management of the organisation or branch concerned to approve all loans, grants and donations of an amount exceeding $1, 000; that the committee of management be satisfied that specific criteria are met in relation to each such loan, grant or donation; and that an annual statement giving specified particulars of each loan, grant or donation be lodged with the Industrial Registrar and be available for inspection only by members of the organisation concerned. I stress those last words because this is a matter of making available to the members of organisations, be they employer or employee organisations, advice about what is being done with their funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matter having been raised by the Opposition, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations referred to his remarks in the second reading debate and asked the Acting Attorney-General to ensure that when the policy in relation to the companies provisions was under consideration-it is under consideration at the moment in the context of the planned exposure draft of the companies and securities legislation, a draft which it is hoped will be available for public comment-the question of making the companies legislation compatible with the legislation which is now before the Senate was given consideration. There is nothing either sinister or surprising in the fact that this Bill represents some advance on the companies legislation. The Government will ensure that the question of parity between the two sets of legislation is given consideration in the context that I have just outlined. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I request the Senate to reject the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition.

        This amendment relates to the question of double jeopardy in that certain offences which are proscribed by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are proscribed again by this Bill. The list of offences proscribed in this Bill is considerably wider than the list of offences proscribed in the companies legislation. It is not quite an analogous situation, as perhaps the Government would like to say. It is undesirable that there be in any legislation provisions whereby a person should be a susceptible to being charged with an offence-it may be a very technical offence under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act-and then, as a result of that, be eligible for a penalty which could involve losing a job or being ineligible to hold a job. That is the reason the amendment is moved.

         â€”I addressed this question in my response during the second reading debate and I will not delay the Committee at any length. I referred to the fact that under the companies legislation a disqualification applies in the case of indictment for any offence in connection with the promotion, formation of management of a corporation. So quite a broad category of offences under company law could give rise to exactly the same situation of double jeopardy. As I said before, whether a situation arises under the Constitution, under the Companies Act or under this legislation, it is inherent that there is an offence which is punishable and which carries the further penalty of disqualification.

        I refer the Committee briefly to the list of actions covered by the sections referred to in proposed new section 132F (1) (b), which is sought to be deleted. The offences listed there are offences in relation to section 45, strike ballots ; the contravention of or failure to comply with a Federal Court order with respect to disqualification from office; a failure to comply with a direction or order of the Federal Court relating to the performance or observance of rules; a contravention of or failure to comply with a direction of the Federal Court made in deregistration proceedings concerning performance or observance of rules; the non-compliance with or obstruction of an order of the Federal Court in relation to certain alternatives to deregistration or the order of the Governor-General in relation to deregistration on community safety, health or welfare grounds, and so on. I will not go through the whole list because I very much doubt whether it will change the views of members of the Committee. I will seek leave to incorporate this list in Hansard because it demonstrates the nature of the offences which the Government is seeking to make relevant to this question of disqualification. In my view and in the Government's view they are matters which demonstrate unfitness for office. As I said, the argument of double jeopardy is one which is really inherent in having a system of disqualification when people have committed offences whether it is under this legislation or other legislation. I seek leave to incorporate that list in Hansard.

In the list incorporated in Hansard by the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) reference is made to offences in relation to secret ballots ordered under section 45 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and a penalty of $20. What does that offence mean with respect to a person's capacity to be disqualified from holding office? It is an extraordinary situation if a person is disqualified from holding office on the basis that that person is charged and convicted of an offence for which the penalty is $20. There are a number of offences of that kind. I seek some explanation in relation to them.

         â€”I am quite happy to go through the sections of the list in detail. I should like to refer to the first section which is mentioned in the clause which it is proposed should be deleted. Section 46 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act states:

       <para>
        (b) destroy, deface, alter, take or otherwise interfere with a ballot paper . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The first named offences relate to interference with the conduct of ballots. I would have thought that offences of that nature were very relevant to the fitness for office that we are dealing with under this legislation. Of course, it is always true that there can be relatively minor transgressions which might give rise to a technical breach of the law. But I point out that under those circumstances the Bill provides that a person may go to the Federal Court of Australia and seek a waiver or a reduction of the period of disqualification. In other words there is a way out with respect to a technical offence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I concede that under the sorts of offences that I have just mentioned there may be something of a relatively minor nature. But the general line of these offences is that they are offences which go to the integrity of the trade union operation. They are not unimportant matters; they are matters that go to the honesty, the fairness and proper conduct of elections. If people are convicted of offences under sections such as these then I would have thought that there would be pretty broad agreement in this chamber that they would not be the sort of people that one would want running the trade union movement.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a good number of sections set out on this list which has been incorporated in Hansard. If it is the wish of the Committee we can either go through each section in turn or we can simply examine in detail all the offences which can give rise to disqualification. I understand that that detailed examination was undertaken by the National Labour Consultative Council. The list was varied in accordance with discussions at that time. The purpose of the list which I have incorporated in Hansard and have handed to the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) is simply to provide a ready shorthand reference to the range of offences which are dealt with under this legislation.

         â€”The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has taken the first provision on the list which he has incorporated in Hansard. One of the offences is counselling a person not to vote in a ballot. In the last few years that I have been in this Senate I have seen that done day after day. I have seen it done at Federal and State elections. People say: 'Why bother to vote'?

         â€”That is not the point. That is one element of the offence. One can be charged and convicted for counselling a person not to vote in a ballot. That is an element of the offence. As a result one then becomes eligible for the treatment under this Bill, the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill, if it is passed. This means in blunt terms that one loses one's job. If that is so the Minister's solution to that is that there are always provisions where one can go along to the court and say: 'This was not a very serious offence. Therefore my period of exile from the industrial relations arena should be limited'. That is not good enough. That is why I have moved the amendment. It is just not good enough to put that sort of provision in legislation of this kind. The Government is not being fair to trade union officials as against other citizens in the community. The Government is treating trade union officials quite differently.

         â€”Nothing could better illustrate the ransom to which the Opposition is held by the trade union movement than the objection which has just been made. Nothing could be more fundamental or more relevant to the decent running of unions than the maintenance of a situation where the fundamental Act under which the trade unions operate has to be honoured by trade union officials. Surely breaches of this Act are most relevant to the question of whether someone is fit for office. I can understand the argument being raised in this Committee that offences which have nothing to do with the running of trade unions ought not to be relevant to a person's fitness to hold trade union office. But when the Opposition's premier objection to this legislation is that it is breaches of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that give rise to disqualification then it seems to me that we have a very strange situation. I think most impartial observers would believe that the most relevant sections with which we ought to be concerned at having trade union leaders comply are those relating to industrial law in this country.

         â€”I regret that due to circumstances I have not entered this debate thus far. We are dealing with the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill 1982 as a whole in the Committee stage. I must say that the provisions of the Bill will have limited effect on the industrial relations situation within Australia. When I saw that we were going to deal with conciliation and arbitration legislation I thought that we were probably going to deal with the Conciliation and Arbitration ( Complementary Industrial Relations System) Amendment Bill which will have an effect on the proper conduct of industrial relations within Australia. However, that is not to be, as I understand it. This measure has taken precedence over the other measure in the mind of the Government. The Government needs to be judged on its priorities in this regard. The other measure, which I cannot mention because we are in the Committee stages of debate, had the approval of the States and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who represents the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, stated that the clause under consideration has the approval of the ACTU.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister who represented in the Senate the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner, said in a second reading speech that a provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill at that time relating to industrial unionism had broad-range support. He said that industrial unionism was ACTU policy. I put down a copy of the ACTU's policy on that matter. It was contradictory to what the Minister said in his second reading speech, which was presumably written by somebody else for him. But if the advice that was given to the Minister on this occasion is the same as the advice that was given to the Minister on the previous occasion, it is incorrect. On this occasion the Minister has said that the ACTU has agreed with this provision. I do not know whether we should report progress to see whether in fact that is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the provisions of the regulations on this matter. There are prescribed offences under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and also offences under the regulations. Last night we talked about the principle of double jeopardy. That principle applies also in this case. I am just flipping through the conciliation and arbitration regulations. If the Minister has time, I would like to go through some of the regulations with him now-regulations 140, 146, 146AQ, 146AS, and 170. I ask him, and other senators, to see whether the offences under those provisions would warrant the rather dramatic double jeopardy that is imposed on people who have committed prescribed offences. Regulation 170 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject to sub-regulation (3) of this regulation, a person voting at any ballot ordered by the Commission under section 45 of the Act shall not show the ballot- paper to any person, or permit any person to see the ballot-paper, while he is marking it or after he has marked it, and a person shall not, directly or indirectly, request, require or induce any other person to show such a ballot- paper to him, or to permit him to see it, while the ballot-paper is being marked or after it has been marked.
       </para>
       <para>
        One could argue about that. One could say that a person who showed his ballot paper to somebody could be the subject of a prescribed offence under this provision. In the trade union movement, I have regularly been concerned to advise on and rail against the idea of people showing other people their ballot papers. I have also been against those who have requested that ballot papers be shown to them. But the point made in regulation 170 is that a $20 penalty is imposed if somebody happens to show another person their ballot paper. However under this provision such a person cannot be an officer for five years just because he happened to show his ballot paper to somebody.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of counselling persons not to vote, not necessarily in an election for a national official, but in a section election for a particular union, there could be a situation where two people are running for a position and both are equally not acceptable to an official or, indeed, to a member. Another member could come along and ask that member: 'Who will we vote for?'. The member could say: 'I would not vote for any of them in a fit'.

         â€”I have not had an opportunity to look at the regulations. If the Minister likes I could read them to him and find out whether we can come to that regulation. But I am sure his advisers could advise him as to whether, upon reflection, the ACTU as distinct from, perhaps, one of its officials, has agreed to this or whether it has not. The point has been made quite validly by Senator Button that there is a double jeopardy involved here. The point that is being made by me is that I have consistently, by actions within the trade union movement, opposed the breaking of the law and the regulations. I have consistently advised and counselled anyone with whom I have been associated to observe meticulously the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and its regulations. My record stands on that.

        However, this legislation will have very little effect at all on the industrial relations scene in Australia.

         â€”I was not surprised to hear Senator Harradine say that he has been meticulous in advocating that people should obey the industrial law. I neither am suprised nor have any doubt that that would be the case. That is precisely why I find the attitude which he is supporting here rather puzzling. It is one thing to point to the variable seriousness of the offences which are listed in the clause and it is quite another thing to say that the offences which can be committed under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should be those offences which are excluded from the legislation which provides for the disqualification of union officials who behave in an illegal manner.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As I said earlier in the Committee, it seems to me that the most pertinent area of activity for assessing the fitness for office is the area of industrial relations itself. If an official has breached the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and/or the regulations it seems to me that that is the misfeasance which most appropriately calls into question the fitness for office. Senator Harradine pointed out that some offences of a relatively minor nature are listed in the clause. That is true. As I said before, that is met by the fact that the disqualification is not absolute. It is a disqualification which can be removed or reduced by an application to the court. The important point is that this legislation is central to the operation of industrial relations, the breach of which, I think, ought give rise to doubts about fitness for office. It is all very well to point to the lesser offences which are listed. As I indicated earlier in the Committee, the effect of this amendment would be that a trade union official who might have breached section 40, which covers serious matters such as threats, intimidation and the infliction of violence in connection with the conduct of ballots, in my view, clearly ought to be within the purview of this legislation. So I regret that there should be a sense in the chamber that in this most relevant area we should exclude the offences from consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think I mentioned directly the Australian Council of Trade Unions in my earlier comments. I mentioned the National Labour Consultative Council on which the ACTU is a key representative. This legislation was considered by the Council. I am advised that the ACTU opposed such legislation and it so said at the NLCC. However, there was detailed discussion by that body about the proposed legislation; in other words, a form of legislation was put before the NLCC for consideration. There was detailed discussion about what it should contain as to offences against the Acts and regulations which ought be caught. Representatives of the ACTU agreed that the sections and regulations which are listed in 132F (1 ) (b) would need to be in the Bill if the Government were to have a Bill of this sort. I want that to be made quite clear. There is a distinction. There was a discussion on the detail of the Bill and there was a variation to the list which was in the proposed legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point of this legislation is to ensure that, as in other areas of activity, people should not hold office when, by breaches of the law, they have indicated an unfitness for office. In the Bill as it stands at the moment the Government has sought to delineate those areas which it believes are of concern with respect to the operation of trade unions. There are questions of fraud or dishonesty which are punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of not less than three months. There are offences in connection with the formation, registration or management of an association or organisation and other offences involving the intentional or reckless use of violence. I think to fail to include in that list offences which go directly to the conduct of industrial affairs and to the affairs of a union is to leave a very strange omission indeed . I commend to the Committee the maintenance of offences against the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and regulations as a central area for potential disqualification.

My simple point is that paragraph (a) refers to convictions by imprisonment for a period of not less than three months. That is the criterion in respect of that paragraph. But there is no such criterion in respect of the other offences mentioned in paragraph (b). I make the simple point that some of those offences have penalties of a mere $20. However, in respect of paragraph (a) any offence that has a period of imprisonment of a lesser period than three months is not regarded as a prescribed offence. I just point that out. I realise, of course, that the Federal Court of Australia itself can determine on application by the offender whether or not the offence would prevent the offender from standing for election. I also say that the legislation tends to give a little bit too much power to a Federal Court judge.

         â€”The Opposition is supporting the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 and the Customs Securities (Anti- Dumping) Amendment Bill 1982, although in the case of the first Bill we will in fact be moving a second reading amendment to reflect our continuing dissatisfaction with the character of anti-dumping law administration in this country. The need for this protestation on our part could have been avoided, of course, if the Government had devoted sufficient resources to enable expedient, quick and effective dumping investigations to be made. But, as a result of its small government philosophy, only now very belatedly beginning to be re- evaluated by this Government, the situation has been in the past that Australian manufacturers have had to wait for over nine months for a dumping decision, in fact, finally to be made. It is that aspect of it, as I say, to which our amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time is addressed. I move :

       <para>
        As will be clear from the text of that amendment paragraph (b) is changed from the form in which it was circulated insofar as we talk about being required to ' shift the practical burden of producing evidence from Australian industry' rather than 'shift the burden of proof'. I will explain that when I come to it later on.

       <para>
        Australia is particularly sensitive to imports being dumped here because of our relatively heavy reliance on tariff barriers as opposed to non-tariff barriers and because of our small domestic market. A shipload of dumped shoes will obviously have a greater impact in Australia on price competitiveness of domestic goods than would be the case in, say, the United States of America. Moreover, unlike many of our trading partners we do not rely on non-tariff barriers to protect our industries. A country, of course, with a sophisticated import licensing system needs virtually no anti-dumping legislation at all. It is, therefore, essential, particularly in these times of massive world over- capacity, that the Government ensures that Australia has an effective anti- dumping system which will provide quick and efficient investigation. It is only under those circumstances that Australian industry can be protected from unfair overseas competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments contained in these two Bills go at least part of the way to ensuring and effective set of anti-dumping procedures for this country by removing some obstacles or perceived obstacles to the efficient operation of that system which have been shown up in recent litigation. Just how much litigation there has, in fact been-such as to justify these particular provisions-seems to be a matter of some uncertainty. I am aware of only three actual cases in which the exisiting law has, in fact, been taken advantage of by importers to delay what would otherwise be the effective operation of the anti- dumping measures. But it appears that certain loopholes have shown up. The first of them relates to section 14 of the parent Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act which is sought to be effectively removed by this amending Bill. The Bill removes an obligation on the Minister not to take action which is inconsistent with the obligations of Australia under international agreements relating to trade. At first sight that seems a fairly alarming provision to be removing from legislation, particularly given the way in which ministerial willingness to observe the constraints of international trade agreements has been the subject of so much active debate in the context of Mr Sinclair's performance over Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd and the breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that was there involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is some evidence that this provision, which is really doing no more than expressing in rhetorical form what is implicit throughout the entire Act, is being used as a vehicle for bringing unmeritorious actions to challenge the validity of decisions made at a departmental or ministerial level against importers of goods. This provision has, it appears, been the source of at least one interim injunction which has been granted by the court in circumstances where the merits of the argument have not been terribly obvious but the implications of the injunction being granted have been quite considerable in terms of their effect in delaying the start of the whole anti-dumping investigation process. The circumstance is that a legal appeal in this area can give appellants a period of reprieve in which they can continue to import without the prospect of ultimate financial penalty. It is in that context that this provision is sought to be removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, the Customs Securities (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill-the second element in this package-amends section 42 of the Customs Act so as to remove a doubt which has existed in the past as to whether cash securities can, in fact, be imposed for the purpose of the anti-dumping Act-cash securities being the preliminary way of ensuring that some brake is put on the activities of importers pending the final determination of the validity of the dumping claim. This is another area in which there is some evidence-again, I am not sure just how much in practice-that the availability of a form of judicial review, of an appeal, has been misused and has been the subject of cynical exploitation by importers who have had no great merit on their side but have sought to take technical points about section 42 of the Customs Act not technically authorising the application of these requirements of cash securities.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is in that context that recently the regulations were amended, removing the application of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act from decisions to take cash or other securities, the preliminary part of the anti- dumping machinery. What was accomplished in a temporary or preliminary fashion by regulation is now to be accomplished, in terms of formal legislation, by clause 6 of the Customs Securities (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill, which will supersede those regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is now clear that, as a result of that legislative provision, there will no longer be any opportunity for importers or foreign exporters to frustrate that part of the anti-dumping machinery. Aggrieved parties of course will retain their right to appeal against the final determination that is made under the anti-dumping machinery, but their capacity to seek judicial action is a vehicle for delaying the operation of that system at an earlier stage will be removed. There will still be a check against capricious administrative action, at least in extreme cases, by the vehicle of judicial review of the final determination.
       </para>
       <para>
        I enter one caveat about all of this: That is as to the way in which these measures, in particular the regulatory change and now this legislation, have been brought forward without reference back to the Administrative Review Council , which is the independent statutory body charged by this Government with the task of advising it as to what sorts of administrative decisions ought to be the subject of judicial review and which ought not to be. These provisions were originally the subject of judicial review because of advice received from the Administrative Review Council that this was an appropriate area for the operation of judicial review.
       </para>
       <para>
        Everyone has always appreciated that experience may well have shown that some of these provisions were unreal and that the commercial environment might have been such that it would be necessary in future to make some amendments in the area of the decisions available for judicial review. But it was contemplated that any such amendments would take place only in consultation with the Administrative Review Council. Certainly that was the view of the Council as expressed in its third annual report in 1979, in which it recommended that no exclusion from the categories of judicial review should be made without a further recommendation from the Council. It may be that the Government felt obliged to move quickly for commercial reasons in this particular circumstance but it is an unfortunate state of affairs that there appears to have been no consultation whatsoever with those who are extremely expert in this area and on whose advice the Government has hitherto relied.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me conclude by indicating briefly what our second reading amendment is all about. I have already moved it formally and have indicated a change of language insofar as paragraph (b) is concerned from the form in which the amendment was circulated here and that in which it was moved in the House of Representatives. Paragraph (b) is directed to the question of who is to bear the burden of establishing what? We believe that the system could be improved if legislation were to provide explicitly that the practical burden of producing evidence as to the case or otherwise for a prohibition order in this area should be on not the Australian domestic industry but rather the importers who are deriving the advantage of the dumping. I appreciate that the point was made in the House of Representatives that we are not talking here about onus or burden of proof in any strictly technical legal sense. But I understand that in a practical sense the process has operated as follows: All the action has had to be taken at the level of the domestic Australian producers with the Department which makes this decision doing some investigative work of its own but really relying on the domestic producer to produce the major material on which its decision will ultimately be made. We say that the whole process would work better and more relevantly to the present economic environment in which Australia finds itself were the burden to be shifted the other way around.
       </para>
       <para>
        Paragraph (c) of the amendment seeks to impose penalties on any additional imports which are negotiated during the investigation period. The justification for that was well explained by Mr John Brown, speaking on behalf of Mr Hurford in the other place, and there is no need for me to spell that out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Paragraph (a) is quite important because we are seeking here further legislative change to ensure 'that a prima facie decision concerning dumping is reached within 12 weeks and that the total investigation period is reduced to a maximum of 24 weeks'. At the moment it is conceded by the Government that the time taken for an anti-dumping investigation is of the order of nine months. We feel that that ought to be drastically reduced, particularly in the present very strained economic environment and with many Australian producers going to the wall and with extreme and justified neurosis about unfair international competition. It was said in the House of Representatives that the Government had recently made some resources available to the anti-dumping investigators with something like an 80 per cent staff increase and that it was now anticipated that the investigation and decision time could be reduced to something like 120 days as compared with the present average of nine months. That may be so and we welcome those steps being taken but what we are asking for here in this second reading amendment is not just a statement of aspiration on the part of the Government but rather a legislative requirement that these things be done within a particular timetable.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is important legislation. It justifies, even in our present circumstances of time constraints, a little attention to its detail. Our feeling is that the Government has never been able to appreciate that in the sorts of economic circumstances in which we find ourselves we do need an efficient and responsive public administration system. We feel and fear that so many areas of public administration have been allowed to run down and become ineffective and that in order for them to be beefed up again we need something more than simply the band -aid patching-up that is involved in these two Bills. Rather we need some fundamental rethinking about the way in which the whole administrative system is to operate. The amendment is a statement in broad terms of at least some of the changes that we believe to be necessary if that administration is to work better in the future.

         â€”Dumping of products from overseas on to the Australian domestic market can take three forms-price dumping, freight dumping and subsidisation. Price dumping occurs when the imported price on the Australian domestic market is lower than the overseas domestic price. Freight dumping arises when the transport or freight cost is less than normal. Subsidisation exists when a country gives a financial subsidy to the manufacture of goods which are exported to a foreign country. In Australia there is the additional requirement of proof of material injury or threat of material injury. An improvement would be to transfer the onus of proof to the importer rather than allowing a continuation of the current practice whereby the Department of Industry and Commerce has to have proved to its satisfaction that there is material injury or damage to local industry. In the past, Australian manufacturers in particular have had a great deal of difficulty in proving material damage. In all too many cases we have seen the proof come only at the stage when the company that is subject to dumping difficulties has been in the hands of the liquidator or the official receiver in bankruptcy.

        Australia is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. Article 6 of this agreement covers anti-dumping and countervailing duties provisions. The codes are international agreements between sovereign states and are not intended to provide personal or individual benefits. They are between one state and another. To date, all the anti-dumping litigation has been in the area of procedures and not on the substantial issues of dumping. In addition to the damage caused to Australian industry by overseas exporters dumping their products in Australia, some use all sorts of devious means to get their goods on to the Australian market. Let me give a few of those examples in addition to dumping. Firstly, goods are invoiced at the correct price but a credit is established in a Hong Kong, Swiss, Japanese or some other bank. Secondly, goods are invoiced correctly but the overseas supplier gives a cost free holiday to the importer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, importers use what is known as the printing by-law, which allows their goods duty free access into Australia. Two problems can arise with that. The by- law specifically excludes printing with markings of any kind that are for identification or distinguishing purposes only. However, certain institutions-I regret to say a number of State hospitals, including those in New South Wales- have allowed their previous narrow identification stripes or other markings to become wide and deep coloured, thus allowing the printer to comply with the words of the by-law if not the intent. Further, some firms have been printing diagonal narrow stripes or other markings on woven man-made fibre fabrics for use as pocketing. As this fabric is printed on only one side, these markings are invisible when it is cut and sewn into garments. A further example is washable dye. On entry into Australia the fabric is printed but it requires only a minor wash for the dye to run out. These are just some of the techniques being used which are having a devastating effect on Australian industry.

       <para>
        When we look at percentage changes in relation to certain tariff or quota protected categories, we find that there have been some dramatic increases over the last year in one instance of up to 135 per cent. These imports are causing tremendous damage to Australian industry. To use a local example, part of the new seven-year agreement included a provision that fabrics weighing less than 120 grams per square metre could come in duty free. We warned the Government that the importers would reduce the weight of their fabrics so that they could come in duty free, that is, at less than 120 grams per square metre. Unfortunately this provision has had a devastating effect on the protection of a local company in Devonport, Tootal Australia Ltd.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further problem with the Australian economy at present is caused by not only imports but also a lack of demand. The Government has responded in part by developing a package of measures designed to boost activity and employment in the manufacturing sector. That package comprises the wages pause, the restoration of the 20 per cent government preference for local industry in purchasing for its own Government requirements and also an 80 per cent increase in the number of officers in the Department of Industry and Commerce to monitor dumping. This increase in staff is necessary because there has been a substantial increase in dumping complaints in recent months. The processing of dumping complaints are designed to be completed within 120 days compared with 250 days in the United States. In the past in Australia it took a substantially longer period. The Government is seeking to re-examine the general policy on developing country preference. This will be a significant help to local manufacturers. There will be a streamlining and improvement of references to the Temporary Assistance Authority. The overseas aid program is also being designed to provide increased benefits to Australian business. There is a 'buy Australian ' campaign for which $1m is being set aside for advertising in 1982-83.

        Manufacturing industries in Australia, including the textile industry, are experiencing recession conditions. I regret to say that in my own State of Tasmania today 96 employees at the Repco company were put off. The reason given was a lack of demand. This is one of the tragedies that the Australian community may have to face in the next 12 months to two years. I regret to say that the textile industry in some sectors is experiencing its worst time since 1930. It is rather ironic that other sophisticated countries protect their industries more stringently than we do. I am pleased to say that through such measures that I have mentioned our Government is increasingly looking to assist in maintaining employment in the manufacturing industry because manufacturing is at a low ebb at present. The Government may have to review the mechanism of what is commonly known as broadbanding in the textile industry to overcome a number of problems in this area. I refer to jean imports. There has been a 117 per cent increase in the importation of jeans under category 107. The problem is the emphasis on the import of jeans at the expense of trousers, et cetera, which are within the quota category.

        It is necessary to review the matter of dumping and increase the onus of proof on the part of the importer. Action in relation to dumping is effectively being taken out of the hands of the Government and placed in the hands of the judiciary. This is one of the reasons why it is necessary to repeal section 14 of the Customs Securities (Anti-Dumping) Act to ensure that cash securities may be taken in anti-dumping cases. In these situations it is necessary for the importer to put up cash to an agreed value as an interim measure. If a dumping case is not proved the money is refunded.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second amendment relates to section 42 of the Customs Act to provide that provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures are not reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. It is important to emphasise that the Act and the amendments follow the General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade code. Essentially we maintain that section 14 of the Act is superfluous and circumlocutive at present. Section 14 requires the Minister, before issuing a certificate against dumping, to issue a notice in the Government Gazette. This states that the Minister has followed all the international agreements -in this case, GATT. The Act itself conforms with GATT requirements. We maintain that it is superfluous.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures that the Government is taking by these amendments today are essentially short term and interim ones that do not affect the final outcome. In other words, they are short term interim measures but appeals remain on the results of the final decision. We must also point out that these interim measures are not issued without prior investigation by the Department of Industry and Commerce and discovery by that Department that a prima facie case of dumping exists; and secondly, that there is proof of injury to the Australian manufacturer. As I mentioned earlier, one of the dilemmas is the difficulty in satisfying the departments. I repeat: Section 14 is redundant. I am not aware of any precedent in an Act which requires a Minister to state that he is following certain rules, certainly of an international obligation. For example, even in Australia the Attorney-General does not have to prove that he is working within the light or powers of the Australian Constitution before he brings forth a new regulation, Act as such or an amendment to an Act.

       <para>
        There have been criticisms of these proposed changes principally from importers . These have come principally from three centres-America, China and New Zealand. It is rather hypocritical of New Zealand, in particular, to criticise, because imports into that country are subject to import licence arrangements and under the closer economic relations agreement they do not phase out until 1995. Secondly, New Zealand, unlike Australia, does not have any system of administrative appeals. By this Bill before the Senate we are endeavouring to stop these importers employing delaying devices. In other words, they get an injunction to delay and to frustrate the intention of the employment of fast- track anti-dumping provisions and the taking of securities. Without those devices, it is all very much a farce, because overseas importers can have a once -off dumping situation into Australia and get away with it, and we might never hear of them again for 12 months, two years or even five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also emphasise that this Bill is not, in a sense, a protective device. All GATT signatories are adamant that the products of overseas industry, subsidised or marginally costed, must not be dumped with the effect of damaging the local domestic manufacture. Some people have argued strongly that there is need for rights or compensation to importers, but I suppose that there would be one importer, as compared with 100 domestic manufacturers, who might be injured in some way; so the relativities are very unbalanced. Our first responsibility is surely to look after the domestic manufacturer who employs local citizens, whose jobs are very much at risk at present. Therefore, in the light of our employment situation, this legislation is very significant and very important. I wish it a speedy passage. The legislation makes it necessary that the codes are agreed on a country to country basis, rather than on an individual to country basis. I therefore welcome its submission and wish it a speedy passage.

        As the Opposition amendment does not call for action but merely expresses an opinion, and although I agree with its sentiment I cannot see any great benefit being derived from my crossing the floor on this issue.

         â€”These Bills represent the Government's single most important response to the massive dumping of foreign goods on the Australian market. It is a totally inadequate response. Indeed, one might say that it is a shamefully inadequate response. If this is the best my friend Andrew Peacock can do in this area I am afraid that it is just not good enough. Much more could have been done and must be done. In fact, I am not convinced that this Bill is even terribly fair. A firm of lobbyists has written, I think to most members of parliament, about some hair-raising examples of bungling by the Australian Customs Service in this field. It would seem that the heavy handed and arbitrary approach of Customs to quite damaging cases at many times has had the effect of losing jobs for Australians at least in the short term.

        I have outlined the view of the Australian Democrats on protection many times in this place and in many other forums. The Democrats are not a high protection party. I want to make that very clear. However, we believe that industries which are regarded as strategic and socially necessary for this country ought to be protected when protection is necessary. We are in the middle of a monumental economic crisis, a crisis which, I am sorry to say, has not yet penetrated the ivory towers of Canberra. It is a crisis of monumental proportions. It is absolutely vital that our industries get some protection and get it fast or we will be faced with the prospect of having no secondary industry at all in this country.

        Of course, allegations of dumping are made by many firms across the land almost routinely. I admit that it is a difficult task for departments to weed out those claims which are justified and those which are not. Perhaps it is a case of departments accepting a comment that has been made before-that life was not meant to be easy. I believe the Government is gradually coming to the realisation that in a large number of cases claims of dumping are justified. One example came to my attention only the other day. A South Korean firm is dumping certain kinds of steel products at a price which is must lower than the price for which raw steel can be bought in Australia. Similar products are made by John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd in Victoria. That example shows that we are not being subjected to tough competition. That sort of approach is simply economic warfare .

        It has never been an Australian characteristic to stand meekly by and take punishment for too long. I submit it is high time that far more Australian flags can be seen flying outside the company headquarters of our industries in this country. We should be much less concerned with the flags of South Korea, America and European countries. I will give one more example of the problem of dumping to which industries are subjected. This case concerns the Sidchrome tool company , a company about which I happen to have some first hand knowledge. After two years of solid effort it managed to convince the Department tha prima facie there was a case of dumping of Japanese tools on this market. The Department then set about proving the facts, and this is how it did it: An official got on an aeroplane and flew to Japan. He booked in at a hotel and rang up a public interpreter-somebody who was hired without any reference to his ability at all. The interpreter and the Australian official hopped on a train and went knocking on the doors of various Japanese tool manufacturers with the plea: 'I am an Australian offical and I would like to see your books'. This request was transmitted to the Japanese tool manufacturers through the public interpreter. Honourable senators can imagine how much information he got from the Japanese tool manufacturers in that way. This is an actual case. I believe the procedures have been improved since then, but that was the way Australia attempted to prove dumping.

       <para>
        This Bill is a very small step towards some rationality in this whole area. Undoubtedly importers have been abusing the provisions of the legislation right and left. We are aware that some injustices will be left as a result of this legislation, but we can see no alternative to their being borne for the time being at least. In the meantime I give notice that we expect much more from the Government in this crisis through which we are passing. I also indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the Australian Labor Party's second reading amendment. It has been read and I will not speak at length on it. It puts the burden of proof on the importing company and not on the Australian manufacturer. It puts a time limit on how long the Department can take to prove that dumping is or is not occurring. It would be a very welcome step forward in this area if the Government took notice of these requests made by the Opposition and which are wholeheartedly supported by the Democrats. We wish the Bill, with the amendment, a speedy passage.

The common support no doubt reflects the concern which is felt around the chamber about current economic circumstances and the fact that with world trade in the state it is in obviously we are in an environment where dumping is far more likely to occur; and there is evidence of that in Australia in the number of applications which have been brought to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. This legislation represents part of the Government's response to that difficult real world with which industry has to cope. I do not wish to debate this matter at length because that would be unreasonable given the restraint which has been shown by other senators, but I would like to respond merely in a limited way to the points made by Senator Siddons in his general attack on the Government's attitude to Australian industry.

         â€”Yes. I think he would have welcomed the continuation of the investment allowance, the 2.5 per cent depreciation of new non-residential income producing buildings, the continuation of the Industrial Research and Development Scheme and the upgrading of the Export Market Development Scheme. This debate takes place not in a vacuum but, as I have said, in a world context of very difficult trading conditions and as part of a series of responses by government to the changed reality of 1982. Again, there were changes in the recent Budget to our taxation law with respect to retention allowances and the taxation treatment of company group profits. I think this will have been of assistance to manufacturing industry. There is the question of the employee share issue schemes which are to be made exempt from income tax.

         â€”I think that will have to be left to next year. I think we have run our course for this year. Turning to protection, there has been concern with respect to the question of dumping. The Government has already responded to that concern. The legislation is again part of that response. It is clear from the statements made by the Australian Labor Party that it sees the failure to obtain a speedy enough consideration of dumping applications as being central to the need for this legislation. In that regard I would simply draw the Senate's attention to the fact that consistent effort has been made to reduce processing time. Prior to January 1982 processing time was upwards of nine months and sometimes even longer. It has decreased since May 1982 because of improved techniques introduced by the Department and because of increases in staff.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have been asked by industry to reduce the target time to 175 days, that is 25 weeks. We have now arrived at a point at which the delay is about seven months, with four weeks for a prima facie decision, and we have accepted a target of 17 weeks maximum for a final decision. In other words, the Government has in fact accepted a more limited time scale as being more appropriate than that suggested in the amendment. It has taken the necessary staffing and training measures to ensure that it meets its targets. There is no quarrel between the Government and the Opposition in terms of objective or the ideal of having speedy hearings. I am grateful to Senator Watson who indicated to the Senate some of the action which the Government has taken. I should acknowledge Senator Watson's continuous interest in this area. He has raised this matter with the Government on many occasions to my knowledge and, as his speech indicated, he has taken the closest possible interest in the very technical area with which we are concerned this afternoon.
       </para>
       <para>
        We oppose the amendment which has been moved, in part because it suggests that the Government is not prepared to accept the sort of objective which is contained in the amendment-that is, to reduce the investigation period to 24 weeks-when in fact the government has accepted a target which is less than that. In regard to the second part of the amendment, it is inappropriate to the system under which we operate to talk in terms of 'practical burdens of producing evidence', to use the words that Senator Evans substituted for the burden of proof reference that was in the original amendment. The fact is that complaints are brought to the Department. Under the system we operate under it is then the Department's responsibility to arrive at a decision and to make inquiries and investigations. So it is not a matter of either party being given that onus of proof about which some honourable senators are concerned. In regard to the suggestion that penalties should be imposed, again, that is not an appropriate approach to anti-dumping procedures which do not involve the imposition of penalties but rather the restoration of fair trading conditions.

       <para>
        Although it has not been evident so much in the debate in this chamber, concern has been expressed in public debate on this measure about the possibility that anti-dumping procedures can be abused in quite the opposite direction. In other words, whilst the main focus of debate has been upon the possibility that manufacturers will not receive adequate protection against dumping, some concern has been expressed also that those who are competing with importers may unfairly use dumping procedures to their advantage and to the detriment of people who, by the time the matter is determined--

         â€”That is true. But I wanted to indicate during this debate that the Government has also given consideration to the matters which have been raised in that regard and to the comments which have been made that the Government should introduce a procedure designed to obviate the occurrence of possibly inadequately based complaints from Australian industry about dumped or subsidised goods. The Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act does not make express provision for complaints or requests that may give rise to remedial action under the Act. Action under the Act may be taken by the Minister on the basis that he is satisfied that certain facts exist. It has been argued that there should be some form of constraint against the misapplication of the Act and, in particular , a deterrent against the mischievous complaint which could have a deleterious effect on the importing community.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government is concerned that the rules relating to dumping and subsidisation should be observed equally by all parties to a complaint in order that fair trading conditions can be restored as quickly as possible. The preferred solution to dumping and subsidy situations is not, of course, the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duties but the resolution of the price distortion by mutually agreeable solutions. With a view to minimising the occurrence of inadequately based complaints and further reduce the inquiry time, the Government will now require complaints about dumping or subsidisation to be supported by a statutory declaration made by the appropriate officer of a complainant. The Government believes that this requirement will act as a constraint for more properly considered complaints which are documented in evidence. Furthermore, complaints supported by a statutory declaration can be more readily relied upon in the knowledge that a sanction can be imposed in respect of a false declaration. There is broad unanimity in the Senate that this legislation is necessary and desirable in the difficult trading conditions of 1982. I commend the Bill to the Senate and thank honourable senators for their support of it.

        Leave granted.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, the Special Employment-related Programs Bill 1982, seeks the authority of Parliament to enable the Government to fund certain useful programs throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recognition of the difficult employment circumstances facing many Australians, the Bill is designed to provide worthwhile employment opportunities to a large number of our unemployed, to an extent consistent with the Government 's basic economic policies. As such, the Bill complements other employment- generating measures which the Government has introduced, including, of course, the wage pause.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will be aware that the proposal to establish these special employment related programs was raised with Premiers during the conference on December the 7th. At that conference, the Commonwealth Government indicated its preparedness to spend over the next twelve months the Commonwealth Budget savings resulting from a successful 1983 wage pause. The Bill thus demonstrates- in an immediate way-the important benefits which are available from an effective nation-wide wage pause for 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exact amount of the savings which will eventually be available from the outcome of the Premiers' Conference is not certain.
       </para>
       <para>
        Estimates indicate that savings for the remainder of 1982-83 and for the first half of 1983-84 from a national 1983 wage pause could be of the order of $300m. That figure, which is reflected in the Bill, is a gross figure; no deduction has been made for the taxation receipts which otherwise would have accrued to the Commonwealth. The estimate is based on the expected balance of the bulk allowances for wage and salary increases provided for in the Commonwealth's 1982 -83 Budget; an allowance for notional wage increases forgone in the first half of 1983-84; and Commonwealth savings resulting from a 1983 wage pause in Australia's primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation has already been introduced to secure a wage pause for Commonwealth employees. Legislation will also be introduced to ensure savings from the education sectors are realised.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot estimate with certainty at this stage the actual level of savings that will be available as a consequence of the wages pause. Consequently, the Bill preserves flexibility for the Government to spend an amount consistent with the savings actually achieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for expenditure by the Commonwealth itself throughout Australia. It also provides for grants and advances of grants to be made to the State and Northern Territory governments-and through appropriate mechanisms, to local government authorities-for the purpose of funding special programs. Such grants would be made either for approved programs or for programs of expenditure where agreement has been reached with the receiving government on matters such as the criteria against which programs would be judged. Where the States themselves take on additional staff for Commonwealth funded programs, we would expect them to use, to the maximum extent possible, the services of the Commonwealth Employment Service. In this manner some preference for employment could be given to long-term unemployed adults.
       </para>
       <para>
        In determining the allocation of any funds to States, the Commonwealth will take into account factors such as population and the ability of State governments to identify and facilitate work on worthwhile programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where it would be useful, funds could be provided to local government authorities. In such circumstances, further criteria-such as the existence of comparatively high unemployment-would be brought to bear.
       </para>
       <para>
        The criteria for program funding which would apply to any grant to the States and local government authorities would be essentially the same as those which the Government would apply to funding Commonwealth programs under the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Eligible programs would need to be of high priority, to have high Australian materials and labour content and to be capable of being carried through quickly. Additionally, programs should desirably make a worthwhile or lasting contribution to national wealth, for example, by improving productive capacity, adding to basic infrastructure or reducing future operating costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided that $100m will be allocated for welfare housing. Other projects which would meet the eligibility criteria include: acceleration of capital works already under construction; repairs and maintenance to existing plant, machinery, roads and building; repairs and readily implemented upgrading of key elements of Australia's infrastructure; and minor works. Thus the Commonwealth will not be funding make-work schemes, or programs of only passing effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not intended that the Commonwealth would seek matching funds from the States, although reports indicate that a number of State governments will be applying their budget savings from the wage pause to similar employment- generating programs of a worthwhile kind. The Commonwealth will, however, seek to ensure that State governments would not use Commonwealth financing as a substitute for their own funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth statutory bodies which are not dependent on the Budget will also derive worthwhile savings from a wage pause. The Government expects these bodies to apply such non-budget savings on programs of commercial merit, on reducing the need for wage-induced increases to charges or on improving their longer-run financial structure. It is evident that adoption of these courses by the Commonwealth's commercial bodies would provide at least short-term opportunities for employment generation. The Commonwealth Government has suggested to the States that their commercial statutory authorities-and local government authorities-could utilize the benefits of a wage pause in a similar manner, and elements from the above approach are being adopted by some State governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has attempted to estimate the employment effects from the proposals advanced in this Bill. Such estimates are not readily available as programs have not yet been determined, and different programs would have different employment consequences. In any case, it is difficult to calculate a net increase in employment, as account would need to be taken of the alternative uses to which the savings could have been applied (such as reducing the 1982-83 deficit and thus reducing upward pressures on interest rates). A rough estimate, however, suggests that direct employment generation-on a gross basis-could be of the order of six to ten thousand persons. Naturally, second round effects would add significantly to that estimate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, while these proposals to spend the savings are framed so as to give useful results, the larger employment and economic benefits accrue from the wage pause itself. Acceptance of that wage pause by the community, the States and the Commonwealth Parliament is needed if those benefits, and the benefits inherent in this Bill, are to be obtained. The Government welcomes the community-wide support for a wage pause and acknowledges the support offered by the Premiers on 7 December. The Government now looks forward to the effective support of honourable senators to whom I now commend this Bill.

       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill and its accompanying Bill, the Special Employment- related Programs Bill 1982, is to give effect on the Commonwealth's side to the agreement reached at the Premiers' Conference last week.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Acting Prime Minister reported to the House of Representatives on 8 December 1982, at the Premiers' Conference there was general support for the widest and most effective wage pause. The Premiers of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory agreed with the Commonwealth Government that this pause, which would apply to both the public and private sectors, should be for 12 months. The Premiers of the other States will be seeking a 6 months pause.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth indicated its intention to legislate for a wage pause in areas of its own employment. The States will be asked to extend the wage pause to their own areas of employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The immediate effect of the legislation will be that savings to the Commonwealth Budget of the order of $300m should eventuate over the next 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        The necessary legislative authority for the expenditure of these funds, on employment-related projects throughout Australia of the Commonwealth's nomination, taking full account of the views of the States and the Northern Territory, will be dealt with in the accompanying Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that the international recession has impacted on our economy with a surprising suddenness. As the Acting Prime Minister said our domestic economic performance is being affected by a reduced demand for our exports, rock bottom commodity prices which have reduced the profitability of our resources sector and contracted plans for new resources investment while increased import competition is being experienced as overseas supplier react to the variation in market opportunities facing them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no need to remind Australians that all this is happening during the worst drought in our memory.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are serious problems. They require positive action by all who are interested in directing Australia back into a sound ecomomic position.
       </para>
       <para>
        Developments in domestic wage outcomes have been far from helpful.
       </para>
       <para>
        Average weekly ordinary time earnings rose by about 17 per cent over the year to the September 1982 quarter. This increase is far in excess of the increase in CPI, 12.3%, over the same period, and labour productivity which was virutally unchanged. In addition, reductions in standard weekly hours are not reflected in the earnings figure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian businesses have not been able to compensate for these drastic increases in wage costs, due to weak domestic demand and the world economic recession. As a result profits have fallen by about 13% over the last year and retrenchments have multiplied. Those in employment have increased their real incomes, while their less fortunate fellows have lost their jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        For some time this Government has been arguing before arbitral tribunals for the greatest wage restraint possible. The Prime Minister wrote to the Remuneration Tribunal and the Treasurer appeared before the Tribunal in July last. The Government briefed counsel before the Academic Salaries Tribunal about the same time. In both tribunals our submissions asked that the worsening economic situation be taken into consideration and that the tribunals give a lead in wage restraint.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, in an unprecedented move, the Government, in view of its responsibility as manager of the economy, argued in the clerical/administrative case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that current economic circumstances required there should be no increase granted at all to some 112,000 public servants.
       </para>
       <para>
        In August the Commission, having taken into consideration the Government's assessment of the economy, awarded percentage rises substantially less for higher paid employees than those originally offered.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since then the economic situation has worsened and the level of unemployment has risen quite dramatically. It was in these circumstances that the Government decided to call together the Premiers and the Chief Minister on 7 December. Prior to the meeting discussions were sought with the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this Bill the Government is legislating for a 12 months pause in wages and salaries and in reductions in standard working hours in its own employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will suspend for 12 months the powers of certain tribunals, authorities, bodies or persons which could make awards or determinations that vary remuneration funded from Commonwealth sources. The definition included in the Bill will ensure that the Remuneration Tribunal, the Academic Salaries Tribunal, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Public Service Board, and a whole range of other remuneration-fixing authorities will not be able to exercise these powers in respect to Commonwealth employees through the prescribed period. The Bill suspends the power of these remuneration -fixing authorities to make or vary any award, determination, decision, order, regulation or contract or to make, vary or certify an industrial agreement, so as to increase the rates, or minimum rates, of any remuneration, or establish a new benefit in the nature of salary or wages payable in respect of Commonwealth employment. There is a similar suspension of powers in respect to reduction of the standard working hours in Commonwealth employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Remuneration Tribunal and the Academic Salaries Tribunal will no longer be empowered, through the prescribed period, to hold or continue any inquiries or to make any determinations or reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        These tribunals will not be able to make reports on related matters which could include electorate allowances, travelling allowances and other such payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly the other remuneration-fixing authorities will be precluded from increasing rates of travelling allowances, expenses of office allowances, and other various allowances payable in respect of Commonwealth employment in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will apply in the same way to the remuneration and working hours of Commonwealth employees in the external territories. It will apply to Australia- based staff but not to locally-engaged staff at overseas posts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The definition of Commonwealth employee is quite wide ranging. It will include those persons either full-time or part-time, permanent or otherwise, in the administration of a Territory, an authority of the Commonwealth, or a prescribed company. The definition includes members of the Defence Force. Over 470,000 persons will be covered by the legislation. Following amendments in the House of Representatives it will also apply to public sector employees in the Northern Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated earlier, consideration has been given to those, other than Commonwealth employees, whose remuneration was wholly or significantly contributed from the Federal Budget. The Bill provides for suspension of the powers of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to hold or continue any inquiries or to make or issue any findings. In conformity with this it will deem that the Tribunal is not in contravention of sub-section 98BA (4) of the National Health Act 1953 by reason of the suspension of its powers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of this will be that remuneration paid to pharmacists for dispensing of certain prescriptions will not be varied during the period of this pause.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remuneration of members of the medical profession is very significantly affected by the level of approved fees under the Health Insurance Act 1973. In these circumstances the Government in this Bill seeks to continue appropriate regulations during the period of the pause so that the level of fees approved for payment of benefits from registered health insurance funds will be maintained at current levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        This action obviously cannot of itself stop medical fees from rising. The Commonwealth will be approaching the medical profession to seek the co-operation of all of its members in the application of a pause in medical charges for the next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will also be approaching industry leaders and the professional associations to seek their co-operation in respect to their own incomes to bring about a similar pause in fees and charges during the wage pause. We will be seeking a national effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has already announced that the thrust of its initiative is to prevent a new community round developing in wages and salaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        However it is not the Government's intention to truncate the completion of the current 'community wage round' that was potentially provided for in the National Wage Decision of May 1982. By that decision a broad standard was set as a notional upper limit to increases in wages and salaries from December 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        That standard relates to the movement in the metal industry which was, for the tradesmen fitter, $25 a week in December 1981 and a further $14 per week in June 1982. Appropriate proportionate amounts have been allowed for other classifications.
       </para>
       <para>
        Every offer that has been made to Commonwealth employees since May 1982 has been with the proviso that the rate being offered is tested against that National Wage Decision by the appropriate tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most, but not all, Commonwealth employees have received wage movements this year that have brought them to the level indicated by the National Wage Decision . The Commonwealth has determined that no action should be taken which would involve inequitable treatment of employees who have not as yet participated in the current 'community round'.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is then provision for some exemptions in this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where a remuneration-fixing authority has entered into an agreement or taken a decision, on the matters covered by the Bill before the commencement of the pause it may give effect to that agreement or decision under this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, regulations could be made by the Governor-General which would restore, to a specified remuneration-fixing authority, powers in relation to a specified matter which would be powers that, but for this legislation, would be exercisable by that authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        These exemptions will not be made lightly. Each particular case will be the subject of examination by Ministers before regulations are put before the Governor-General.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of classes of employee to whom offers have been made but the required examination by appropriate arbitral tribunals has not been completed. In some cases the examination of claims is still progressing and offers when made could be referred to the tribunals for evaluation against the National Wage Decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is prepared to use the exemption powers under the Bill to ensure that all its employees are treated equitably in respect to the current community wage round.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the matter of reduction of standard working hours in Commonwealth employment I want to refer to the negotiations that have been substantially completed following the Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the ACTU, the Public Service Board and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in June 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        That Memorandum of Understanding set out the agreement of the Government and the ACTU that negotiations could take place which would identify agreed 'trade- offs' so that standard working hours could be reduced to 38 hours at negligible cost. It was agreed that, when completed, the agreements covering particular departments or authorities would be presented to the appropriate arbitral authority to test against the criterion of 'negligible cost'. Two of these negotiations have been completed, Williamstown Naval Dockyard and the Department of Transport and Construction, and were endorsed last Friday by a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        To apply the pause to the other negotiations would be seen as a breach of faith by the Government. That is not our intention.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Departments and authorities that have substantially completed these hours negotiations we intend that they should be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible. Each case will be considered then by the Government and, if the criteria have been met, the Governor-General will be advised so that regulations can be made to allow the appropriate arbitral tribunal to examine and evaluate the agreement reached.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the requirements before any of these negotiations commenced was that an affirmative decision would not lead to 'flow-on' into the private sector or other non-Commonwealth public sectors. In the circumstances, the Government will not be considering any agreements that would have the potential for 'flow-on'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the regulation-making power would be available if in the national interest, it became necessary during the wage pause to have the remuneration of a particular class of employee examined by an appropriate tribunal. It is not envisaged that this will be required except in extreme circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not the intention of the Government to say one thing and do another. It is our intention to prevent a new community wage round further eroding the strength of the Australian economy and to provide a breathing space to allow the economy to digest the large increases in real wages that have occurred over the last two years.
       </para>
       <para>
        May I emphasise that this legislation is in conformity with agreement reached at the Premiers' Conference for action in the public sector. I ask honourable Senators to examine the legislation as a necessary part of the concerted action that the Government is taking.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has already approached the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to seek the immediate convening of a Full Bench to consider extending the wage pause to the private sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sir John Moore has agreed and we will make our submissions on Thursday, 16 December.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth will be supported by the governments of Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory in our submission to the Commission for a 12 months pause. We believe that the Labor States, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, will support the private sector pause for a period of 6 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        While this legislation is aimed at a pause in increases in remuneration and reduction in standard working hours for all those on the Commonwealth payroll, it should not be seen as being discriminatory against those in the Commonwealth public sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is an essential part of our overall thrust, in co-operation with the governments of the States and the Northern Territory, to have in place a wages pause over the next 12 months and to provide the necessary basis for savings to the Commonwealth Budget to provide additional expenditure on employment-related activity of $300m in the course of 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        The extent to which this legislation and our submissions to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the various employer and professional bodies in this country are successful will be of great significance to the future of the economy.

        â€”The Opposition is pleased that the Social Security Amendment Bill 1982 is being debated in the chamber this afternoon. We welcome the Bill. We do not oppose the Bill, not because of Christmas spirit but because we are very pleased that the items in it have been brought forward, as they are primarily matters which we have urged the Government to remedy for a long time. The Bill is not perfect but it certainly will improve the social services legislation. For that reason, we do not oppose it. For the last two months, in fact, the Opposition has been urging the introduction of a Bill to restore sickness benefit eligibility for people who earlier in the year were excluded from it by a legal opinion from the Department of Social Security. We do not often meet with such success and certainly such rapid success in a response from the Government. Another matter which is included in the Social Security Amendment Bill is one which the Opposition has raised many times in the past. We are particularly pleased at its appearance in this legislation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I begin by referring to the clauses of the Bill dealing with family allowance for school leavers. Honourable senators who were here in 1977 may remember that when the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, stopped the unemployment benefit for young school leavers over the summer vacation she promised that the Government would continue paying family allowance until the unemployment benefit was payable. The argument for continuing the family allowance was put in both Houses. My colleague in the other place, the honourable member for Prospect, Dr Klugman, stated that, without family allowance:
      </para>
      <para>
       There may be a sudden drop in income of $11 or $12 for that family, which is probably a very large proportion of the total income. That child then has the additional costs of trying to find a job, the costs of going to the Commonwealth Employment Service office, going to the office of the Department of Social Security, ringing up, buying newspapers which advertise jobs and that sort of thing.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the debate in this House at that time two Labor senators raised that matter, but not one Government member or senator spoke in support of unemployed school leavers or urged that the family allowance be retained for them. However, at the end of the debate in the Senate the Minister, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, gave an assurance that family allowance for those people would be continued and, foolishly as it turned out, the Senate accepted that assurance. Irrespective of whether she intended that the family allowance should be paid, it just did not happen. Either she did not follow it up or the officers of her Department did not follow it up-they may even have disobeyed her instructions. It was not because it was too difficult; the current Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, and his senior officers have found a way-a way that was open to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in 1977 and since then.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am raising the matter of the failure of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and the Governemnt to honour that 1977 promise for the same reason that I have done so in intervening years: Poor families have had to do without $30, $40 or even $ 50 at Christmas when it was needed for food, clothing and other bills over that time. It has never mattered to families of relatively wealthy people, including all of us here. It has affected, in fact, only parents on low incomes, including pensioner parents who lost dependent children's allowance for the same period. My most recent efforts to persuade the Government to continue the family allowance was a small piece in the October 1982 issue of the Social Security Bulletin, a well known journal on social security in this country which happens to be circulated from my office. It states:

      <para>
       In 1976 the Fraser Government, obsessed with its war against so called 'dole bludgers', decided to stop unemployment benefits to school leavers who could not find jobs. They are not paid until six weeks after their final examination or when they leave school, whichever is the later.
      </para>
      <para>
       But, in spite of promises made by Senator Guilfoyle at the time, family and student allowances are also stopped over this period. This year family allowances finish up on the first or third Tuesday in December.

       What are these teenage children to live on in their first six weeks of unemployment?
      </para>
      <para>
       How are parents supposed to feed grown young people with no less than average appetites when the Department of Social Security, which has paid family allowances to those children since birth, cancels all payments at the very time they need new clothes, transport and telephone money to hunt for work, and food to sustain them for it?
      </para>
      <para>
       Government members and senior public servants have no problems with the policy. They can manage family holidays and lavish Christmas spending without depending on social security payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is poor families-including unemployed parents in Newcastle and Wollongong- who have to explain to their children that presents and food are scarce.
      </para>
      <para>
       Can even this Government derive satisfaction in saving a few thousand dollars by leaving teenage school leavers stranded without family allowances?
      </para>
      <para>
       If not, the Minister should order that payments be made until the end of January so that their families have a marginally less bleak Christmas.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would not have read from that document but for a subsequent development. The Minister, Senator Chaney, was good enough to inform me that he was bringing in legislation to cover that vacation gap. I am sure that he will accept that he really did not know about the situation until he had read of it in the Social Security Bulletin to which I have referred. He then took immediate action to remedy that neglect. I thank him for it and pay a genuine tribute to his readiness to take such prompt action. However, I am fairly cynical and less than happy about the prominent Government back bencher who has been touting it around his electorate that he was responsible for the campaign to extend family allowances to school leavers and that the legislation is being changed solely because of his efforts. That back bencher is notorious for saying in the past that unemployment was a myth, that the unemployed were overpaid and that if they really wanted jobs they could find them. As it happens, his electorate surrounds the area of Wollongong and is suddenly getting a very long list of unemployed persons. His suddenly found compassion has surfaced only because of the threat of the ballot box. The Opposition has been bringing this matter to the Government's attention for years. Changes which should have been made in earlier years will now cost between $3m and $5m.
      </para>
      <para>
       I come now to the changes in the legislation regarding sickness benefits. Almost three months ago I, and others, began hearing stories of people who were being ruled ineligible for sickness benefits because of a redefinition of the so -called loss of income provisions following a legal opinion from the Attorney- General's Department. I believe that a legal opinion of this type should not be a private document. Neither I nor any other honourable senator can cast doubt on that document because we have not seen it. But it would not be impossible in such cases for a dubious legal opinion to change administrative practice affecting thousands of people. Therefore I believe that we as legislators should be able to see that opinion. The Hulme-Griffith opinion on invalid pensions was responsible for a massive crackdown on the granting of invalid pensions some years ago. But fortunately that ludicrous opinion became public. If the Government is certain of its legal grounds in changing payment guidelines of this type then I believe it should have no difficulty in making such an opinion a public document so that we can all have a look at it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was told, very sadly, of a 34-year-old widow pensioner who was refused sickness benefit, though she had a long-standing illness and was on some eight different drugs. She was able to obtain the special benefit, but because the special benefit carries with it no right to supplementary or rent allowance and no access to free pharmaceutical benefits and because her dependance on these medications did not allow her to manage in society she was forced into a mental home.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have all heard about Mr Darrell Carthew, a double amputee who was taken off the invalid pension. Because the invalid pension was not defined as income under this legalistic interpretation he was not given sickness benefits. We have heard of the young unemployed lad who had not applied for unemployment benefits because he still had some savings. When he fell from a ladder and broke his leg he was ineligible for sickness benefits because he had no income. Under the amended legislation these people will be eligible for sickness benefits and a health card. I am extremely pleased that this has been accomplished before the end of the current parliamentary session, not next year as we feared.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also very satisfactory that none of these people will have to serve the seven-day waiting period before being paid sickness benefits though they will wait some time for payment now that such payments are made in arrears. I believe that the implementation of this legislation-which is not contentious, at least in the view of the Opposition-is a good time to reassess the fairness of the seven-day waiting period. Not all people who fall ill when in the work force are entitled to sick pay. It certainly is the case that many more people than before are working in temporary or part time jobs which have no such entitlement. All we are doing in imposing a seven-day waiting period is exposing them to further hardship. I think it is about time we assessed whether, in difficult economic times such as this, the seven-day waiting period is fair.
      </para>
      <para>
       The change in the legislation which gives a supplementary allowance to unemployment beneficiaries who fall ill or who are injured under the same conditions as sickness beneficiaries is also a good move. However, we continue to deplore the Government's policy of taxing this very small rent assistance for these people. I am aware that it is a taxation matter and not a social security matter; but I raise it, as I have raised it before, as an injustice because the same payments for pensioners are not taxed. I hope, in this spirit of goodwill, that the Minister for Social Security will now look to this matter with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and that when we come back we will find that that anomaly has been removed from the social services legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, as I said, we do not believe this legislation is perfect. I will move a second reading amendment which I hope will be accepted by this chamber. I would have liked to move an amendment in the Committee stage to remove the anomaly, but I am aware that if it were passed the legislation would not be passed, and, as the House of Representatives will not be sitting for a while, we would have been in a situation where people who would otherwise get benefits under this legislation would not get them.
      </para>
      <para>
       One such disappointment concerns the restriction in section 113 of the Social Services Act, which restricts the amount of sickness benefit payable to no more than has been defined as loss of income. In general, it is a provision applying to self-employed persons and primary producers. In poor seasons or when getting established they often have very little actual income averaged out over the year . If they are entitled in every other way to sickness benefit and have no other income, it seems to me reasonable that they should receive the full rate of sickness benefit. I do not see how it can be considered reasonable to expect a man or woman who suffered a heart attack to support, respectively, himself, a wife and a child or herself, a husband and a child on $67 a week, as occurred in one case which was brought to my attention. It is estimated that the removal of section 113 from the Social Services Act would cost no more than $10m a year. If that sort of solution is unacceptable to the Government, I request the Minister to consider how payments can be arranged to give full benefits to a sick person who has no other income.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendment we would wish to move concerns a group of people who have caused controversy in this chamber in the past and, I dare say, will in the future. Although I believe there is a genuine and cogent argument for including them in this legislation, I accept the fact that the Government, with its views of this area, would not do so on this occasion and that certainly we cannot hold up the legislation because of this. I refer to persons who are involved in an industrial dispute. As many honourable senators will remember, the definition of such persons was widened in 1979 to include union members who were laid off as a result of industrial action by members of the same union. The union members can be in another industry in another State and be opposed to or utterly ignorant of the industrial action which put them off, yet they can be precluded by the 1979 legislation from receiving unemployment benefit or sickness benefit during the dispute. The present interpretation of 'sickness benefit' also excludes them from that.
      </para>
      <para>
       If these people are sick and are entitled to sickness benefit in every other way, how are they to pay rent, to eat, to pay for medicines or to pay for transport to doctors? If they suffer a disabling illness or injury while their works or mines are closed in a dispute they should be able to receive some social security payment even if the Government insists on its present restrictive legislation, as it has done. I really think the Minister has to justify how the Government fails to pay this benefit and how it could even starve people. I know that if such a person is married there is a possibility the wife can apply for a special benefit, but a single person who is thrown out of work because of an industrial dispute to which he is not even a party cannot expect any help under this legislation if he or she suffers an illness or an accident. There may not even be a charitable organisation in the area that he or she could go to in those circumstances. I think the Government should reconsider the appropriateness of the sickness benefit in such a case.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am told that the probable cost of the changes to sickness benefit legislation will amount to about $2m. It is a very small cost when I consider the hardship suffered by some cases that have been referred to me. On two occasions in the past in this chamber I have asked several questions since the new sickness benefit instructions were put into effect a few months ago. I have put out Press statements. And many members of the Opposition have put out statements-there has also been the article in the October Social Security Bulletin. Except for the injustices about which I have just spoken I am happy that the episode can be laid to rest after what has been one of the shortest and sharpest campaigns we have ever conducted in this area of social security.
      </para>
      <para>
       My final point-one of which I hope the Minister is increasingly aware-is that variations in conditions and payments of social security pensions and benefits are tiresome and difficult to administer and can be disastrous for persons shot from one to another, particularly when they lose money and additional benefits. The need to settle the social security system so that it is, as far as possible, non-discriminatory, is daily more evident to me and should be daily more evident to Senator Chaney. We have a ludicrous situation where people with identical illnesses and needs in fact receive varying rates of social security benefits, in particular the sickness benefits. Their benefits are not based on need or the nature of their illness but on whether, for instance, they were receiving the unemployment benefit or pensions, what their incomes were before they went on to the sickness benefit. This is a matter we should all take seriously and look seriously at. I urge the Government to do so. Having welcomed the legislation and having pointed out that we do not oppose its passage I move the Opposition's amendment to the second reading of the Bill, which has been circulated. I move:

        â€”As Senator Haines, the Australian Democrats' spokesperson on social security, indicated in speaking to the statement by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), the provisions of this legislation have the support of the Australian Democrats since they are in keeping with the statement and are intent on adjusting existing anomalies. The major provisions of the Social Security Amendment Bill, particularly those relating to school leavers, are especially welcomed at this time, obviously because of the impending problems of many families who receive the unemployment benefit and who are unable to continue support for their children who have left school and who are not, under existing arrangements, eligible for any unemployment benefit.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The provisions of this Bill are long overdue. In 1976 the Government stopped unemployment benefit to school leavers for six weeks after their final examination or after the day they left school, whichever was the later. In a number of ways this has caused excessive hardship to many low income families. The Australian Democrats are surprised that it has taken quite so long to get around to discovering this anomaly or, if not discovering it, at least doing something about it. As the Minister for Social Security said in his second reading speech, the budgetary implications of the proposed amendments are relatively minor. If that is the case it is a pity that we have had six years with no action.
      </para>
      <para>
       We support the amendments concerning the sickness benefit and support the Minister's move to end the anomalies which have placed an unnecessary burden on people who are already disadvantaged in one way or another. We would hope that the Government, having commenced what we hope is a systematic examination of social security in terms of the anomalies which have existed within the legislation, will turn its attention to other anomalies which have been brought to its notice over many years. We hope that in the new year we will see further amending legislation to the Social Security Act which will rid the system of some of the most glaring anomalies. It will be an improvement in what will become, over the next year at least, one of the most hard-pressed portfolios within the Government and one which will have to be sympathetically handled due to the enormous pressures which will obviously be placed upon it by the economic downturn and the enormous number of people who are currently on the unemployment benefit and a range of other benefits. I believe that the Minister will find himself under enormous pressure because of this. We hope that the Government will respond to emerging problems that we have not seen in this country probably for some 30 or 40 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Labor Party has proposed an amendment to the second reading of the Bill. Despite the fact that I have just quoted from an article of the Opposition shadow Minister for Social Security in which he said some unkind things about the Australian Democrats, we still intend to support his amendment because I believe it does point out yet another major problem. Senator Grimes raised a point about which we are concerned. We are very much concerned about the person who is thrown out of work because of industrial action taking place in some other part of the community which is not necessarily directly involved with that person. I think it is unfortunate that that type of situation exists within the legislation. Since it does exist and there is no possibility of removing it in the foreseeable future we believe the worst effects ought to be ameliorated wherever possible by amendments. We would not have liked to have supported an amendment at the Committee stage because of the likelihood of holding up this piece of legislation which will be extremely necessary at the beginning of next year. But we do accept the point that a person who is thrown out of work in a sickness context ought to be able to have a benefit conferred on him as with any other person who did not fall under section 107 sub-section ( 4) of the Social Security Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I propose an amendment which has been circulated to honourable senators. The intent of the amendment is not necessarily to put what we were looking at in a formal way, but rather to raise again the other area; that is, if we were moving into this area the Australian Democrats would like to see the situation where a person in that context can have recourse upon his normal entitlement from his employer for whatever accrued sickness leave is available to him. We do not believe it ought to be the case that automatically it goes under the social security arrangements. Even if a person were thrown out of work as a result of industrial action we do not think it is beyond the legislative process to be able to devise a method whereby that person can have recourse to his accrued sickness entitlement from his employer before he reaches the point of having to call on the social security system of this country to support him in his sickness situation. The Australian Democrats will be proposing that amendment to the Opposition's amendment. Whether our amendment is carried or lost, we will still be supporting the Opposition's amendment at the second reading stage because I think the principle is worth supporting. It is worth trying to get it into legislative form at a later stage. I move the following amendment to the Opposition's amendment:

        â€”We are debating legislation which seeks to extend benefits in two ways. First, it seeks to extend for six weeks the payment of the family allowance to the families of school leavers who are unable to get work and are ineligible to receive unemployment benefit. Secondly, the Bill seeks to pick up an unintended anomaly whereby certain people were found to be no longer eligible for the sickness benefit because they have not suffered a loss of income due to sickness. I note that the amendments are welcomed by the Opposition and by the Australian Democrats. That was made clear in this chamber in an earlier debate on the proposed amendments.

       I suppose one of the joys of being the Opposition spokesman on social security is that whatever is done by the Government there is always something left undone . The spokesman for the Opposition always says that while the Labor Party welcomes what is good it would be nice if we did something extra. I note that the pattern has been preserved in the current debate. In any event, I just want to comment on a couple of points which were raised. Senator Grimes mentioned the entitlement of primary producers to sickness benefit. It is true that primary producers, like other people seeking entitlement to sickness benefit, are required to show that they have lost income due to sickness. If a primary producer is in the position where he is not earning income in any event and cannot demonstrate a loss of income, he cannot obtain a benefit. A primary producer who is disabled by sickness and who is required to hire labour to do the work which he would otherwise be doing is entitled to claim the cost of that labour as loss of income. So, in the circumstances where the labour of the primary producer is actually replaced on the farm by some paid help, sickness benefit is payable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another point that I wanted to mention was the rather critical reference to Mr Michael Baume, the honourable member for Macarthur. It is a fact that Mr Michael Baume made vigorous representations to me with respect to the extension of the family allowance to school leavers during any period of unemployment. I regret that the Opposition found it necessary to attack a member who, I think, worked hard to advance the interests of his constituents.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will be saying something about how ungracious the Opposition is in supporting this legislation of which it is supposed to be in favour. In a very serious vein , I wanted to pick up the comments made by Senator Grimes at the conclusion of his speech on the motion that the Social Security Amendment Bill be read a second time. I think there are lessons to be learned in the amendments which are before the Senate at the moment, one of which is that the system is one of very great complexity. That is true both for clients and for administrators. The fact of the matter is that when one is drawing amendments to the social security legislation one is continually brought up against the difficulty of drawing amendments which will not produce unintended consequences. I say that having discussed the matter both with my officers, who have the responsibility of advising me, and briefly with parliamentary counsel. I, therefore, express agreement with some of the sentiments that Senator Grimes expressed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think there is a case for trying to look at ways of simplifying both the legislation and the system. I say that publicly because I would welcome public contribution to what is a quite difficult process. It is very easy to say that things should be simple and straightforward; the actual achievement of that objective is less straightforward. But I think some of the delays which were experienced in our coming to grips with the anomalies which emerged in the legislation which we are addressing today were delays occasioned by a very complicated system in which it is quite easy for things to occur in a way which is not specifically intended.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to the sickness benefit point. A legal opinion was obtained because a difficult case arose which gave rise to an inquiry. That legal opinion indicated that payments had been made not in accordance with the Social Security Act. Very properly, my Department took action to ensure that from that time on payments were made in accordance with the law. At the same time, where there were cases of hardship it was pointed out to operatives in the field that special benefit was available. I believe that we should have come to grips with the policy matters more speedily than we did. But, again, I think that is a function of complexity. It is important that I and my officers learn from that experience, try to ensure that we work towards a simpler system and also respond to difficulties as they arise-not merely ensure that we comply with the law but also make sure that the policy is addressed so that any unfairness in the way things work out is avoided.
      </para>
      <para>
       The social security system is very important to some two and a half million Australians who are dependent wholly or in part upon it for income maintenance. I again wish to make in quite clear to the Senate and to the public that where there are anomalies, where there are difficulties, the Government would wish to see those speedily addressed to avoid unnecessary and unwanted hardship. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I oppose the amendments which have been moved by the Opposition. I indicate that to save time, since the Democrats are supporting the amendments, we will not divide. Clearly, the Government opposes the amendments.

        â€”The Opposition supports the Bill. I must say that, as far as it goes, we actually welcome it. The Australian Labor Party is always keen to see the Federal Government accepting its responsibility for the environment, accepting its responsibility to act as a national government in protecting Australian flora and fauna and, as in this case, accepting its responsibility to implement international obligations acquired as a result of an international treaty.

      <para>
       The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen Australia's arrangements for the protection of its animals, plants and wildlife generally, by improving the effectiveness of its import and and export controls. So far so good, but this week, having seen the events that have taken place in the Parliament, I cannot allow the opportunity to pass without commenting that is a great shame-indeed, a great tragedy-that whereas the Government is prepared to act as it has in regard to this legislation to protect our Australian flora and fauna by imposing more effective export controls, it has at the same time been prepared to abandon its responsibilities, to resile from its international obligations, in respect of the South West Tasmania region.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will not traverse again all the issues involved although I do not think it can be said too often that the Federal Government has made the wrong decision, has abrogated its national and international responsibilities and its decision ought to be overturned. There are people on both sides of this chamber and many people throughout Australia who agree with that statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Bill before us is a wildlife protection Bill and in this respect the Government is acting properly and we welcome the measure. It has been the intention of the Opposition to move an amendment, the effect of which would have been to include the hooded seal and the harp seal, both of which are seriously endangered species, in the schedule of flora and fauna which gain protection under the Bill. We cannot accept the reasons that the Government has given for excluding the hooded seal and the harp seal. In fact, it has given no sound reasons at all. It says that the matter is under further consideration. It is our view that where you have endangered species, where their slaughter is unnecessary and, in the case of seals, where it has been carried out with appalling brutality, the species ought to be included.
      </para>
      <para>
       My colleague Mr Stewart West moved such an amendment in the House of Representatives and it was my intention to move it again in the Senate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I understand that in the event of our having done so we would have had the support of the Australian Democrats. However, the conduct of the Government with respect to the legislative program this session has made it not feasible for us to move the amendment. Although the legislation has been in the Parliament since September, it has not been brought on for debate in the Senate until this evening. Because of the time that has already elapsed, and the seriousness of the matters dealt with in the Bill, the Opposition-I understand the Australian Democrats accept this position also-do not wish to hold up the legislation further. The Government has itself held it up now for five months, which represents quite disgraceful negligence on its part.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators have sat here day after day, night after night while the Government has meandered, wasting time. We have seen filibusters by Government members in regard to two pieces of legislation that they did not want to support . I refer to the retrospective tax legislation and the Australian Democrats' legislation to protect the South West Tasmania region. We have seen Government senators waste the time of the Senate in a most irresponsible and negative fashion, yet here we have, with only a few sitting hours remaining, the Bill before us. The problem is this: If we moved an amendment to protect the harp and hooded seals that amendment, in all likelihood, would be successful. However, the House of Representatives is no longer sitting. It finalised its sittings last night and so the amended legislation could not be returned to the House of Representatives for further consideration by it, as is required under the procedures of the place, until next February. Because there are some electoral implications in the amendment we proposed to move the Government would very likely again put our amended Bill to the bottom of the Notice Paper and several more months could pass before the flora and fauna of Australia received the protection that is provided for in this Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that you will agree with me that this is a most disappointing and unsatisfactory state of affairs. We are in a position to improve the Bill in a way that would receive the support of this place but, because of the Government's mismanagement of its legislative program, we cannot proceed with that amendment without holding up a very important piece of legislation for a length of time which is not acceptable to us. As a consequence we will not move the amendment of which honourable senators have previously had notice. There is nothing more to be said about the Bill because we endorse it. We believe that as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said in his second reading speech the uniqueness of Australia's flora and fauna places a special responsibility on all of us to ensure that we do our utmost to avoid species becoming extinct. A great deal of damage has been done to our natural flora and fauna. We know that this legislation will prevent an acceleration of that damage and for those reasons we support the Bill.

        â€”I support the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1982. I recognise the fact that this Bill is coming before us at a very late stage of the sitting. However, I am glad that it has come before us and that it will be passed before we rise. I recognise the force of Senator Ryan's argument in connection with the hooded and harp seals. I hope that it will not be very long before they are on the Schedules and protected. The provisions in this legislation make it easier for the Government to take action. The Schedules can be altered and added to by delarations. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills made a number of suggestions about this Bill. At one stage it was concerned about the fact that the provisions in the Act could be altered by declaration. The Committee took a general objection to what is called Henry VIII clauses by which the legislation can be altered by regulation. I think the explanation for this which was given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) was very satisfactory. There has been a great deal of delay over the years in making provisions to protect wildlife, fauna and flora. Examples were given by the Minister of the fact that the appendices to the existing legislation agreed to by the parties in 1975 were not put into effect until 1981. Therefore the provisions which have been made in this Bill which enable the Government, by declaration or regulation, to amend the Schedules mean that this matter can be very much on hand and there is no reason why we have to wait for Parliament to resume if the Government's investigations on this matter come to a satisfactory conclusion.

       I think this Bill is very important. Of course the general purpose of it is to put into one Act our obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora-which is known as CITES-and various other international agreements and to protect our native species and ensure that both their import and export is controlled. We have in the past had a number of pieces of legislation on this matter, and that is unsatisfactory. This now puts the legislation into one whole piece, and I think that that is a satisfactory way in which we can protect the forms of natural life which are precious to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Apart from the importance of the Bill itself and the provisions which I think have been very carefully looked over in both Houses of the Parliament, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee did make a number of recommendations. I am pleased to say that particularly in the House of Representatives amendments were moved which very satisfactorily overcome most of the problems which the Committee raised. The Committee raised those matters by way of highlighting what are seen to be possible difficulties, sometimes in regard to inappropriate delegations of legislative power, and it was also concerned, in regard to the matter of appeals , about approved management programs. But that, too, was handled by an amendment in the House of Representatives. The duration of permits was another matter criticised by the Committee and, likewise, that provision was improved by amendment in the House of Representatives. We now have a Bill which is a better Bill because of the processes which the two Houses have gone through. I hope that it will be used extensively and I hope, along with Senator Ryan, that the particular case that she raised will be dealt with soon by expeditious decision which the Government can make without returning the matter to this chamber. Therefore I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. I hope that it comes into quick operation.

        â€”I want to follow up briefly the comments that Senator Ryan made because it seems to the Australian Democrats that we have in the Senate the iniquitous situation that we have had in the past whereby legislation which ought to have come forward long ago does not arrive until the end of the session, whereupon we are called on to pass Bills such as this Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill and the word is put out that the legislation should not or cannot be amended or it will be held up because the Senate is sitting and the House of Representatives is not. This seems to us to be a form of blackmail which the Senate will have to consider very carefully at some future time. It seems entirely inappropriate that one House of Parliament should apparently be regarded as subservient to the other to the extent that it is assumed that that House will not consider matters and that any amendments it makes are somehow of lesser value than amendments made in the other place. This is a matter of basic significance and it applies with great force to this Bill. I suggest that the management of business in the Senate must become a matter of increasing importance as time goes on.

       Like Senator Ryan, we regret intensely that it was not possible to move the amendment concerning hooded and harp seals. We would have been only too happy to support that. Indeed, most people in this country would like to have seen the amendment in the Bill because they feel very strongly about this matter. I would like to follow up what Senator Missen and Senator Ryan have said, and say that I hope the Government will use its powers to see that that very necessary and popular inclusion goes into this Bill in any case, since it can do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       That said, the Australian Democrats do support the Bill wholeheartedly. Its provisions are excellent and we see in it too, a necessary concession to the feeling of the public of this country that not only human beings are important but all forms of life are important and have their values. To an extent all forms of life are dependent on each other-the relationship is symbiotic-and we can go on ignoring wildlife and destroying things at our own peril. This Bill is an indication of a greater strength and significance of that kind of movement. I am not speaking of any fringe group, or of greenies or environmentalists or whoever-although all those terms could be applied to me-because it is now a widespread, almost universal, feeling among the younger generation, especially, of this country that we have great duties towards life of all forms, be it trees , plants, birds, fish or any creature on this earth. We should not destroy those things or commit what I consider to be the unpardonable crime which has been committed so often of completely eliminating species from this planet. That, I think, is a most serious step for any species to take against another, especially a species which calls itself 'rational' and 'humane' and ' compassionate', and all sorts of other adjectives that we like to apply to ourselves.

       We agree completely with the sentiments of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) as expressed in his second reading speech but, unfortunately, the Government does not seem to agree with its own expressed view . This concerns us. I find it impossible to understand why the Government did not heed its own words when Cabinet decided not to exert its influence with the Tasmanian Government and stop the needless and appalling destruction of the South West Tasmanian wilderness which is now continuing and will continue until wiser and rational counsels, I hope, can change that. The Minister stated:

       I should have thought that the Minister's words could in a sense have been an instruction to the Government on the way it behaved concerning South West Tasmania.

I think that, if sufficient thought were given to this matter, the Government would see that it is wrong to build the dam in South West Tasmania. I think that more thought may well further change the community view and the Government's view.

        â€”Senator Ryan claims that a change of Government would be the most efficient way of doing it. On the present showing, I can only agree with her because, if the Government is prepared to fly in the face of the feelings of the majority of Australian people and condone and connive at the destruction of something of value, it has at least to consider the electoral consequences. There again, the Minister said that over-exploitation is the problem. What does the Government propose to do but permit over- exploitation of the Franklin River ? The Franklin River is a river, as we understand it, in its natural form. It will cease to exist. It will become a pond-a regulated, controlled pond. The unique wildlife on its banks will be destroyed. If that is not over-exploitation , I do not know what it is. The Minister's third reason-he weeps crocodile tears -is a simple lack of knowledge and understanding. Scientists from all over the world-some of the most eminent archaeologists and biologists-tell us in this country that we will make the most appalling, terrible mistake and, in fact, are committing a crime, by allowing this destruction to go on. If the Government wants knowledge and understanding, where will it go to get it? I suggest not to Mr Robin Gray who has shown no sense of understanding or knowledge in this matter at all and no wish to aquire them. The Government will find that information among those people-scientists, and people of world repute-who have told the Government that it is making a fool of itself and, more than that, committing a crime by allowing this destruction to go on.

       It would have been a strange irony if those of us on this side of the House were to allow this Bill, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1982, to pass this place without stressing this point to the Government. I have news for the Government but it may not be news to the Government. It has not heard the end of the Franklin issue, not by a long haul. There is much more of it to come than we have had so far. That is saying something because it has exercised the time and patience of this chamber a great deal already. But, if the Government flies in the face of what the people of the country want, it must expect that result. The purpose of this place-and it is certainly the purpose of the Opposition-is to remind the Government continually that, when it goes against the people of the country, it is committing a betrayal of its responsibility and electoral promises. We on this side of the chamber will certainly give the Government no opportunity of forgetting that in the months to come.

        â€”The Senate is debating the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1982. I am grateful to honourable senators who have spoken in this debate and who have indicated that all sides of the Senate support the Bill. It is good legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen arrangements for the protection of Australian animals and plants and world wildlife generally by improving the legislative backing for our import and export controls. That is a good purpose. The Bill deserves the support of this chamber.
       </para>

      <para>
       The Bill will do several things. It will transfer responsibility for the control of wildlife imports and exports to the Minister who is concerned with conservation matters. That seems to be appropriate. The Bill will consolidate existing regulations and ordinances on endangered species and policy regarding exports of Australian wildlife into a single piece of legislation. The Bill will maintain Australia's strict controls on the export of Australian wildlife and it will extend coverage to native flora. The Bill provides for quick amendments to the species listed in the legislation to reflect changes to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and for penalties consistent with the protection to be made for illegal trafficking. So I am grateful for the support of honourable senators. I am also grateful for the fact that the amendments which were anticipated will not now be moved.

       Senator Mason, however, spent some time discussing South West Tasmania in the context of this Bill on the grounds that it concerned wildlife and conservation matters generally. By way of interjection, Senator Ryan indicated that the way to improve the situation was to change the Government. I thought it fair just to place on record a couple of facts about the positions of the major political parties in Australia. I an reminded, of course, that it was a Labor government that first proposed the dam, and the Federal Labor Party did not renounce that proposal at that stage.

        â€”The Tasmanian Parliament met after an election and 51 out of the 54 members of that Parliament, including the Labor Party members in Tasmania, voted for the Bill to build the dam. State Labor in Tasmania is a pro- dam party. I am interested, too, in the contribution made by the Leader of the Federal Labor Party. I have before me an article published in the Launceston Examiner of 7 July 1981. I am not sure, but it may have been during the election campaign. In that edition there appears a story headed 'Hayden petitioned to halt dam row'. The Leader of the Federal Labor Party was approached by a group of Hydro-Electric Commission workers and they called on the Leader of the Federal Opposition to intervene in the State power wrangle. What the story says is interesting. It says:

       Those were the words of the Leader of the Federal Labor Party-'it was a State Government concern'. That should be on the record. The newspaper report went on to state:

       I want to put on record the fact that Mr Hayden, the Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, is reported in a newspaper article in Tasmania as having said that the dam was a State matter.

There is only one other matter that I need to mention in winding up. Some concern was expressed to the Government before the Bill was debated about some of its provisions. Some people had an interest in places like Lone Pine in Queensland. The Government is sympathetic to the intention of the amendment which was to be moved by Senator Ryan, but we did not think it was appropriate to proceed down that road at the time. Senator Martin expressed some concern about exports from Lone Pine. We have considered this and we believe that the Bill, as drafted, will permit exports from places such as Lone Pine in Queensland, which I understand has a long history of this activity, to be considered in appropriate circumstances. The honourable senator is not in Australia at the moment. She is away on other business. Perhaps in the new session, if she wants to pursue the matter I can take it up for her then.

Her colleague, the Minister for the Australian Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, yesterday wrote a letter to the Launceston Examiner stating that the Tasmanian Labor senators, in supporting that legislation, were voting against the interests of Tasmania.

The simple fact of the matter is that of the honourable senators in this place, four Labor senators and one Liberal senator voted for the legislation. Senator Walters and Mr Hodgman are accusing one of their own colleagues of voting against the interests of Tasmania. Senator Walters, in supporting the campaign of an organisation called HEAT, in supplying that organisation with photocopying facilities to photocopy the advertisement which has been distributed around the State and in assisting the organisation to distribute its documents so that they were delivered to me, supported the statement in the advertisement that Labor senators from Tasmania who voted for that legislation were handing over control of South West Tasmania to unknown people overseas. She knows that this is a lie, she knows that it is absolute nonsense, but she persists in supporting people such as this for party political purposes when we have before us a very important issue in Tasmania.

        The simple fact of the matter is that in the referendum in Tasmania and Tasmanian Labor Government supported the Gordon-above-Olga scheme. The fact is that some federal Australian Labor Party parliamentarians-not all of them- supported the no dams position, as did a Liberal senator. I do not recall Senator Walters ever opening her mouth on the issue. I do not recall any newspaper advertisement with Senator Walters giving her views on that matter.

        I just point out that what Senator Baume said today, and what Senator Sir John Carrick said today in Question Time, is untrue. If they perpetuate this sort of untruth I will stand up and deny what they are saying. In particular, Senator Baume, as is his wont, in closing a debate, condemned members of the Labor Party who up until then had absolutely co-operated with the passage of this Bill to the extent that we did not move the amendment that we wanted to move because if we did so and it was carried-it would have been carried-the Bill would not have got through because the House of Representatives is not sitting. If he wishes to act in this deceitful way-there is no other way to describe his actions-I will stand up in the Committee stage of debates, as I have done in relation to clause 31 of this legislation, and point out what a dishonest character he is. I will do it again and again. We will not co-operate with people who come to us, seeking our co-operation, and then slap us in the face in that way. We will not have this chamber treated in that way. If Senator Walters wants to join in and bring about a proper debate we will give her as much as she gives us. Senator Walters this afternoon voted on legislation on which she should not have voted without declaring her interest in that legislation. She is as corrupt as anybody has ever been in this place.

That clause refers to 'management programs for the purposes of this Act'. I take this opportunity to comment on the outrageous intervention in the second reading debate by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), bringing into this chamber all of his Sydney smart-Alick debating tricks that he has learnt over the years as a schoolboy, in order to resurrect the debate on South West Tasmania in the context of the debate on this Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill.

        I intend to reply to the specific point he made. As I understood it, from listening in my room, he dredged up, in order to make his cheap smart-Alick Sydney schoolboy debating point, from a Tasmanian newspaper of a couple of years ago some remarks attributed to the Federal leader of the Australian Labor Party. The Federal leader is said to have stated on that occasion that whilst he would negotiate and carry a point of view to Mr Lowe, he thought that it was for the State Government to make a decision at that time. As I understand it, that was the tenor of what was attributed to the Federal leader at that time. I suppose the point that Senator Baume was trying to make was that that shows that it is a matter for the State Government and not a matter for Federal intervention.

         â€”That is the only point that follows. It is well known that the Federal Liberal Party has always seen this as a matter of genuine concern for the national Government. In 1975-this is relevant to the question of national, State and Territory co-operation-the national Liberal Party and the State branches of the Liberal Party issued a joint declaration to the effect that the South West ought to be preserved. To my knowledge, that joint declaration has never been consciously repudiated, or repudiated in any terms. For this national Government to introduce a clause headed 'Co-operation with States and Territories' in relation to management plans for wildlife protection when, in fact, there has been a joint national-State declaration that the South West ought to be preserved-a declaration of the Liberal Party at its national and State level-which has been repudiated unilaterally by the State Government and connived at by the national Government only a few days after the Flinders by- election is the height of hypocrisy. Anyone who could believe that this Government is interested in co-operating with States and Territories is being completely misled.

         â€”No, I have not. Clause 78 deals with other things-management programs of a co-operative nature being entered into by the national and State governments in relation to the protection of wildlife. My point is that we had a perfect example of such a co-operative agreement between the national and State branches of the Liberal Party in 1975, as outlined by Senator Peter Rae in the debate on 2 December 1982. I bring this up to show how much faith one can put in co-operative schemes between national and State governments of this political character. Amongst other things, that agreement provided for the Commonwealth Government to make a special grant to assist the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service to develop a management plan for the existing South West National Park as a matter of urgency. It also recognised, in that joint declaration, that the Australian people will be asking Tasmanians to forgo revenue that might otherwise flow from unchecked development of the area in order to preserve for the nation an area considered to be of immense national significance. In other words, there we had a joint policy commitment to the development of a management plan for South West Tasmania by the national and State branches of the Liberal Party which was repudiated unilaterally by the State Liberal Government led by Mr Gray. As I said it has been connived at in recent days by the Liberal Party at a national level. My question is: Who did the actual conniving on the part of the national Government to destroy that joint policy? Apparently the Cabinet was meeting and, according to Mr Anthony, Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, was on the telephone and was fully consulted. But was he? Is the decision to connive and agree to the going ahead with the dam on the Gordon below Franklin to be attributed to the Prime Minister? Does he take personal responsibility for that? That is one question that might be answered. I would also like to know whether members in the Liberal party room had a chance to vote on that issue. In other words, I should like to know what happens to joint co-operative efforts in the hands of this particular national Government.

         â€”I speak in support of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill in the absence of my colleague Senator Walsh who, as honourable senators know, is a wheat farmer and knows considerably more about this subject than I do. I point out at the outset that wheat is not, has not and will not be grown in South West Tasmania under any circumstances as neither the climate nor the soil is suitable for growing it. It seems to me that the main points of this Bill are that it provides for the Australian Wheat Board to indulge in futures trading. It is empowered to hedge wheat and financial transactions on futures markets to secure prices for any unsold wheat, but the details of any such procedures must be published in the annual report of the Wheat Board. It changes the advance payment arrangements. At present growers must receive payment on delivery at the beginning of the season. This amendment will allow payment later in the season if the grower wishes. This is to be an arrangement between the grower and the Board. It makes adjustments to the guaranteed minimum price which may now be paid as a provisional and then as a final adjustment, the present system leading to delays since details of charges such as quality, allowance, handling, storage and some transport costs are not known until the end of the season. The amendment will enable the board to expedite finalisation of the season's pool, which at present is inefficient. In other words, this legislation , which I understand has the approval of the wheatgrowers and certainly comes from the Wheat Board, is acceptable. The amendments result from suggestions made from the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and the Wheat Board.

        The wheat industry is in great difficulty at the moment because of the drought in particular. The Wheat Board estimates that in November receivals this year will be 7.9 million tonnes with an expected gross income from the wheat crop of about $1,480m, whereas last year's gross income was $2,535m which means that the Wheat Board has been selling off its stock to meet export commitments. The Opposition supports this legislation because it has the approval of both the growers and the Board. As the passage of a previous Bill delayed consideration of this legislation tonight, we will support it without any further cogent, concise and precise arguments which, I am sure, are familiar to everyone in this place. If they are not I suggest that they read the House of Representatives Hansard of the debate on this legislation in the last couple of weeks.

         â€”I am not sure that what I have to say will be regarded as heartening. I start by pointing out that the provisions of this Bill were contained in proposals put forward by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board. They are part of a chapter of a somewhat sorry history of problems experienced in the management of the marketing of Australia's wheat crop, which I believe is of fundamental importance to Australia,which is of fundamental importance to that large number of wheatgrowers but which in particular is of fundamental importance to our balance of trade and our export income, and which needs to be well managed. The Australian Wheat Board is still having trouble getting out its financial statements. It is still having trouble overcoming the problems which have now continued for what seems like an eternity but is only, I think, about six years. During that time it has not been able to get an unqualified Auditor-General's statement nor has it been able to get statements out on time.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Bearing in mind the amount of money which is involved in the function which it fulfils on behalf of the wheat growers of Australia and on behalf of Australia I can only say that I hope that the proposals which are made in this Bill will enable the Wheat Board to be more efficient than it has evidenced itself as being in the past few years. Because of the experience of the past few years I would like to take up a number of matters during the Committee stage and seek answers to them. Due to the problems which exist in relation to the wheat industry of Australia and because of some of the international trading problems that exist I would not be keen to see the Bill held up for a lengthy period. Undoubtedly, it contains a number of measures which will be extremely beneficial to wheatgrowers of Australia and to Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contained in the Bill are matters which past history would cause the Senate to say: 'Let the alarm bells ring before blithely accepting that this will be an improvement or that this will be in good hands'. I believe that the record of the Wheat Board, including the occasion when the Senate unanimously censured the Wheat Board for its failure to be able to produce its accounts-a matter which it has still not been able to rectify totally-is something which causes the Senate to pay particular attention when amending legislation comes before it in relation to this Board. When it can get its accounts out on time with a clean bill of health I believe that we will all heave a great sigh of relief and say: 'Thank goodness it has been able to produce something about which the wheat growers in Australia will feel a lot more confident than they have in the past'. Mr President, I am sure that you understand what I am saying.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the Committee stage I would like to raise a number of questions in relation to particular provisions of the Bill. I support the efforts of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation in trying to improve the system and putting forward suggestions. As a matter of fact, at one stage it told me that it wanted to convert the Wheat Board from being a qango to a tango-from being a quasi- autonomous non-government organisation to a totally autonomous non-government organisation. I said that I hoped it would achieve its ambition. Nothing would please me more than to have a situation in which it can run its affairs without the need for the Parliament to provide legislation to establish it, assist it and govern it and provide a Senate committee to spend an awful lot of time trying to work out where it has gone so hopelessly wrong at various times. With that qualification and also with that commendation of the efforts that are being made by some people to try to overcome some of the problems, I support the general concept of the Bill. I wish to ask a number of questions during the Committee stage.

         â€”The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1982 has the support of the industry. Indeed the original program of wheat marketing contained in the provisions of this Bill came from the industry itself. Due to the limited amount of time available tonight I wish to mention only one item. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the recommendations of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. I should like to compare those recommendations with the submission of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to the Industries Assistance Commission in terms of wheat marketing. I think that exercise could be of great interest to honourable senators in comparing the similarities in the deliberations of those two bodies.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The only point I wish to make in relation to this matter tonight, among the many that could be discussed, is the point that I raised earlier today regarding the dried vine fruits industry-that is, the emerging problem of the European Economic Community in terms of wheat marketing. I think the figures in this area are as illustrative as those in the dried fruit area. In the 1968-69 growing season the EEC imported 3.4 million tonnes of wheat. If we go through to the year 1973-74 we find that the EEC had turned around that fairly massive import amount to a slight export amount. From there it grew. In 1978-79-10 years after it had been importing 3.4 million tonnes-it was exporting 3.9 million tonnes. In 1979-80 that figure grew to 6.2 million tonnes. The 1980-81 harvest produced 9.6 million tonnes. The advent of such a massive amount of grain on the international wheat market has had a fair amount of ramification on Australia's industry which has been from its earliest years an export oriented industry. If one looks at the EEC in terms of the provision under its common agricultural policy one discovers that it has an enormous amount of latitude in this area to increase further support to its grain growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The common agricultural policy in the EEC and its cost to the community have been much talked about. In many cases they are often talked about as though the EEC did not have a great deal of latitude even to increase further that type of support. Grain support takes up the largest area in the EEC-for example, nearly 60 per cent of arable land in the EEC is devoted to growing wheat. In other words, wheat is one of the EEC's prime crops and yet it takes only 0.7 per cent of the gross national product to support that common agricultural policy in transferring resources from the taxpayers of the EEC to the growers of wheat in the EEC. So the EEC has a fair amount of latitude still to increase its support in this area. The projections are that it is unlikely to increase areas under crop. Indeed, it will probably start to pull back in that area. When one looks at the projections, particularly going through to the end of the 1980s, one still finds a projection on worked markets of an increase in the EEC's net export of some 10 million tonnes probably by the 1987-88 growing season. Since Australia produces not much more than that in terms of its export market we are looking at a particularly important area that we have to come to grips with and to take account of. I think in this area-I mentioned this earlier today during the debate on the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill-we cannot go along with the assumption that the ups and downs of the market will enable us to live through these types of problems. We are in a situation where we will have to fight for every export market that we get; we will have to fight to hold those markets and we will have to fight doubly hard to create new markets particularly in Asian countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been fortunate in terms of the Australian Wheat Board and some of the gains that have been made from time to time in that area. But I point out that the most spectacular gains that have been made have not been made so much through the ability of the Board and grain sellers to sell wheat as through the failing crops in specific countries, namely, China and Russia. I do not think it is good enough for us to sit and wait for a disastrous harvest in one of those countries so that we can maintain our wheat industry at the level to which it has grown. I believe that we have to go out and aggressively seek markets for our wheat in a way that we have not done in the past.

It will give us an added ability in that area and will complement the initiatives that the Government took earlier this year in changing a number of the statutory boards, some of which are in this area, to enable them to become single sellers on the overseas market. This has always plagued many of these areas in that we have sold against one another, against producers within this country, to our own detriment on international markets.

We hope that, with the streamlining that the Government has proposed, coupled with the previous initiatives of the Government, we will have the best possible marketing structure and the utmost flexibility with the Australian Wheat Board to undertake a task which will not be easy. I certainly acknowledge that. It is a task which will be absolutely vital to the enormous wheat industry in this country. We wholeheartedly support the Government's initiatives in this area and hope that the Australian Wheat Board will be able to live up to the type of power which it now has under this legislation actually to undertake the growth or the maintenance of our overseas export market.

         â€”In clause 5, we have a situation where extra powers will be given to the Australian Wheat Board in relation to trading in futures-which it has been doing for some time-for hedging purposes and also an opportunity to trade in the financial futures markets. I do not dispute at the moment the importance to Australian wheat growers under the present world wheat trading system of there being some capacity on the part of the Wheat Board to be able to engage in what is one of the very risky areas of activity.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Anybody who has played the futures markets either in gold, commodities or whatever it may be, knows that, whilst there are possibilities for gains, there are also significant possibilities for losses. I acknowledge that the world wheat trade is a rather different situation with a more limited number of people . Significant risks are inherent in futures trading. The Wheat Board has, to date, apparently been able to hedge to the benefit of the growers. I ask the following question of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner): What would happen if the Wheat Board operated outside the guidelines that are provided and, as a result of its operation outside those guidelines that are provided in the proposed legislation, suffered a significant loss? If it does suffer a loss-I hope that the Senate will acknowledge that futures trading is something which can be subject to losses as well as benefits-who will be responsible for the loss which is so incurred? Would it be the taxpayers of Australia? Let us remember that the amounts we are talking about involve billions of dollars in wheat sales. How much is traded in the futures market will vary from time to time and from year to year, but the total amount of the trade is very large indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Who is being placed at risk? Who will pick up the tab if there is a massive disaster? Will it be the taxpayers or the wheat growers? If the action is taken outside the guidelines provided in the Bill, will the responsibility lie with the individual members of the Australian Wheat Board? If the last is correct-as I understand it there are significant legal opinions to the effect that it is correct-are we not perhaps imposing on the individual members of the Wheat Board a liability which could place them in a most invidious position? I am not opposing appropriate futures trading on behalf of Australian wheat growers and the sale of the wheat crop.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, in looking into this, heard evidence about the way in which the futures operation is conducted. The Committee did not make an adverse report in relation to it, but rather expressed some interest and concern that it is a business which needs to be carefully dealt with. I therefore ask: First, what happens if there is a loss while operating within the guidelines; and secondly, and more importantly, if they operate outside the legislative guidelines, who carries the can, who picks up the loss, which could conceivably be quite massive?

That is a matter of very considerable concern to us all. However, essentially, there is within the guidelines the provision that the Minister would be informed of any breach of the guidelines and the kind of situation that was outlined by Senator Rae. This would lead, therefore, to the intervention of the Minister in the kinds of circumstances which he outlined.

         â€”Obviously, the risk relies totally on the fact that the producers would be in a position of having to share the loss in the normal course. But the point is: Would it be a catastrophic loss? Would it be the kind of situation which would lead to a major disruption of the industry? It is that sort of point that the guidelines seek to address. I think the proper point to make, which I am sure Senator Rae would be interested in, is that in the end through those guidelines this kind of activity which might be carried on by a statutory body which, ostensibly, might be acting on its own, and any breach of the guidelines would be brought within the ambit of political control. The Minister would be advised of the situation in the event of a breach.

         â€”It seems to me that what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) said in reply to Senator Rae was that the first safeguard was that the members of the Australian Wheat Board would report to the Minister for Primary Industry if they went outside the guidelines and that that was some sort of safety provision. I want to know and I suppose other honourable senators want to know what happens if the members of the Board, as has been known to happen with such boards in this country, go outside the guidelines and either do not notify the Minister or notify the Minister very late and, as a result, suffer what could be a catastrophic loss of money. As Senator Rae pointed out, in the wheat futures trade the risks can be very high and the amounts of money involved can be very high. Under these circumstances, who is responsible for such loss-the members of the Board, the wheat producers who contribute to the Board or the taxpayers through the Government?

         â€”The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill provides that if the Australian Wheat Board operates outside the approved futures market guidelines and incurs losses those losses will be excluded from the net pool return and be borne by the growers when the net pool return rate for the season is above the guaranteed minimum price.

       <para>
        The Bill is silent on who bears the losses. But when the GMP is above the net pool return rate is it not customary to include a legislative provision covering an eventuality which is not authorised by legislation. The remedy would depend very much on the size of the loss and on the circumstances at the time. One possible option is for the Board to draw on the reserves of the organisation for that purpose. That is the point which I sought to make during Senator Peter Rae' s remarks. A further point is that there is regular reporting to the political controller, that is, the Minister responsible.

         â€”If we are to rely upon regular reporting all I can say is that history will cause every alarm bell imaginable to ring in relation to the Australian Wheat Board. Until the Wheat Board can get itself sorted out and have even the good sense to let people who are interested, and who it knows are interested, know when it is yet again having trouble producing its annual financial statements or getting an audit certificate I do not believe we can have great confidence that that system upon which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) says we can rely can be relied upon. I find it somewhat alarming that the Minister has indicated in effect that if there is a massive loss the wheatgrowers will pay. The safeguard is that if the Board went outside the guidelines the Minister for Primary Industry would be advised. Nothing in the history of not only this organisation but also, as Senator Grimes said, some others would indicate that this Parliament should have great faith that that would in fact happen.

        I believe this provision regularises something which has been happening for some time, which has happened so far with a history of no known disaster. Before we give it the legislative imprimatur indefinitely I think we ought to signal to those who will operate it that a very careful watch will be kept on how it operates. It may be that this chamber ought to adopt the attitude that after this provision has been in operation for a period one of the Senate committees ought to be requested to look at whether it is operating successfully or whether some legislative amendment is needed perhaps to provide for the point which I have raised about who covers the loss, how risky it is or what sorts of assessments are made as to what we are exposing somebody to. Finally, I ask the Minister quite definitely whether it is not a fact that the opinion of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is that the individual Board members would be responsible for the loss, and has that advice not been received by the Department of Primary Industry?

         â€”I know; I am coming to it. I have no objection to organisations ensuring that orderly market procedures are conducted. But when the board which is set up to do that enters into a risky situation such as the futures market in order to hedge the risks, as Senator Peter Rae has said, we are in a very different situation. Under those circumstances we need-I echo the words of Senator Peter Rae-a much stricter and more regular form of reporting than we have had in the past. We simply cannot rely on the records of organisations such as the Australian Wheat Board and other boards which have consistently reported to this place so late that it has been beyond the Parliament's ability to do anything about it in many ways except to refer the matter to the committee to which I am sure Senator Peter Rae was referring. In the future we will have to insist that this Parliament, as well as the Minister for Primary Industry, get regular reports so that we are not beset with a catastrophic loss which leaves us impotent and able only to pick up the tab on behalf of the general taxpayer. To suggest that even the wheat growers or the individual members of that Board could pick up the sorts of losses which potentially exist in this area is in fact nonsense. It gets back to the fact that the taxpayers will have to pick them up.

         â€”I think that Senator Rae has raised an extremely important point. However, from what I know and have looked at in terms of futures trading in the wheat market I do not think that necessarily an analogy, with, say, silver, could actually hold as hard as we might think. Grain is involved in a different type of futures market. I am taken by Senator Rae's suggestion that Parliament in some way ought to be advised or have some type of overview of the early operations of this legislation. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) might respond in some way-for example, during the Budget session next year-and make a statement to the Parliament in terms of the operation of this Bill over the year so that we could get an early understanding of how it is running and the types of problems the Australian Wheat Board itself may see as likely to occur. If that initial step were taken the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations might not necessarily be involved in prolonged investigation. After the Minister made a statement the Committee could determine whether it was necessary for it to undertake further investigations. I wonder whether the Minister for Primary Industry will respond to the suggestion that this matter be discussed during the Budget session next year?

        I think if we are looking at the management in a prudent way of an organisation of the size and, certainly, the magnitude of the Australian Wheat Board we are looking at a situation where reserves are most important in the continuing operation of the Board. Consequently, policies as to management of those reserves and the manner in which they might be invested and certainly the way in which they are accounted for are tremendously important not only to this Parliament but also to the nation. Certainly, I believe that would be of great concern to the Committee of which Senator Peter Rae is the Chairman-the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. In those events we have a situation where, no doubt, the prudent maintenance of vigilance by this Parliament and by that Committee over the affairs and, certainly, the allocation of reserves by the Wheat Board of surpluses from time to time is a very important question as it touches on the amounts which would be returned to growers on a year to year basis.

        The maintenance of reserves and their investment, I must say, are matters for individual concern. They are certainly matters which would be examined from time to time, no doubt, in this place. The accountability is being established by this legislation. Certainly, increased surveillance over the strategies and the policies of investment in this area are matters which are set forth in the legislation. I am not sure what Senator Peter Rae has in mind specifically in the points he seeks to raise but I take the point generally. The clauses of this legislation touch very important issues within the prudent management of the Wheat Board in the future.

The first point I refer to is that one of the reserves to be created in fact legalises what was the Ceres House reserve which was identified by the Auditor-General as an illegal reserve which had been established by the Australian Wheat Board which, apparently, now is to be legal. Also, provision is made for the import loss reserve. Apparently, both of those reserves are regarded as prudent capacities for the Wheat Board in its overall management. But apparently it has also been accepted that they will be managed without the necessity for prior ministerial approval for the creation of those reserves. I ask: Why is this change being brought about? Why has the change been made from a situation where ministerial approval was required to one where there is no requirement at all for there to be ministerial approval in relation to the creation of this type of reserve? Is it that the Government's new policy in relation to the Wheat Board is to give the Board the utmost autonomy or is this a change where this has slipped by by inadvertence? Is there some other explanation as to why there is now a distancing from the degree of management, including these sorts of things previously questioned by the Auditor-General which the Wheat Board can do without even consulting the Minister let alone getting his approval?

         â€”I do not intend to enter into a discussion of the legalities of the clause but Senator Peter Rae has prompted me to rise because, on several occasions, he has said that certain provisions of the Bill should set the alarm bells ringing. I know that Senator Peter Rae has had a deep interest in the Australian Wheat Board ever since I have been a member of the Senate and quite often has referred the annual reports of the Board to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I would have thought that, given all the occasions on which his Committee has had those reports before it, some concrete recommendations would have gone forward to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and we would not have been faced with the problem that faces us tonight. Senator Peter Rae speaks about setting the alarm bells ringing. They should be set ringing in the minds of wheat growers--

         â€”I accept Senator Peter Rae's explanation. I repeat, if any alarm bells are to be set ringing among the wheat growers it should be because moves are afoot to undermine the Board, and to market wheat outside of its control. That always goes on in times of great shortage such as we are experiencing now. There is never any problem in selling wheat when there is a drought such as we have now, or a bad season in other countries, but when we have over-production, as we often do, the Board is looked to for help by all wheat growers. There is then no criticism of it, except the criticism that it cannot find enough markets for the product.

        We should take cognisance of the fact that the Act that we are discussing tonight has been in operation for 35 years. It was conceived by the late Reg Pollard, as a member of the Chifley Government in 1947. Surely, if there are any weaknesses in it they should have been found long ago. If we cannot improve this legislation the wheat growers will be in serious trouble.
       </para>
       <para>
        I take note of what Senator Peter Rae has said and refer again to the alarm bells that he mentions. In the light of what he has said tonight, about this clause in particular, the farmers' organisations ought to be getting very busy making strong representations to the Minister so that when next the Bill comes before the Parliament it will be so watertight that it will be one that will always safeguard the interests of the wheat growers and will not contain loopholes whereby people who are trying to white-ant orderly marketing in Australia will be able to bring about the demise of the Australian Wheat Board. If that ever happens, rather than the taxpayers being obliged to pay out great amounts of money because of the Board indulging in futures, to which Senator Peter Rae referred, they will be faced with very large bills in order to bail the wheat farmers of this country out of their problems. I hope that, the Minister having replied to the questions that Senator Peter Rae has posed, when next amending legislation on this subject comes before the Senate it will be such that no honourable senator will want to stand here and criticise it.

One is almost tempted-with the history of the involvement of the Auditor-General, the work that has been done by officers of the Auditor-General's Office and the battle that has taken place with the Australian Wheat Board, giving the impression of resistance to a lot of the inquiries of the Auditor-General and even the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations-to ask whether this is simply to avoid the Board being subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General? If this is the case, would it not be prudent, at least for the time being, for the legislation to require the Minister and the Department of Primary Industry to have some involvement until the Wheat Board has a record of performance which would justify the confidence which is being placed in it by this proposal?

         -This clause deals with a matter which has been of some concern in the past. The Auditor-General qualified the accounts of the Australian Wheat Board because of the problem of reconciling stocks and payments in relation to the joint arrangement between the Commonwealth authority and the State authorities; that is, the Australian Wheat Board and the grain handling authorities and receivers in the States. What is proposed here is somewhat curious. A meeting was held at the instigation and suggestion of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations between all of the people involved in this to try to sort out a workable system to overcome the problems which were identified by the Auditor-General. I note from the minutes of the meeting that the problems do not appear to have been resolved at the meeting. The present proposal does not seem to flow from anything which is logical, on the knowledge which I have about the matter. It may be that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) can correct me. I acknowledge that he has been brought into this matter at very short notice tonight. If he is not in a position to answer tonight, will he add this question to the list? Why do we have a position where apparently the remuneration is to be determined by the recipient, by agreement, but it changes the pre-existing arrangement and is, as at the present state of affairs, not subject to any form of audit by an Auditor-General at State level which would enable there to be a determination of the reasonableness of the price being paid to the person performing the services by the wheat growers of Australia? At the moment I cannot understand why this is so. If the Minister is in a position to advise why this has been done, that is okay, but it does not seem to accord with what was agreed to and dealt with at the meeting held in April of this year. It does not seem to be explained by the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill or by the second reading speech, and I look forward to a reply.

I think Senator Rae would acknowledge that point. Obviously, that would be of significant benefit to producers. As to the financial control and the accountability which he outlines, I acknowledge his point about the management in each State. Of course there are provisions whereby each State makes its own arrangements in relation to rates and what have you. Obviously that would affect the accounting procedures within individual States.

         -This is the last point I wish to raise. I hope I can deal with it quite briefly. The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill is changing a situation in which apparently the Wheat Board was the basic one to determine the payment to the authorised receiver to one in which the authorised receiver is the person who basically determines the remuneration which he will get for his services. That is as though we were putting matters into a market situation in which somebody performing a service could say: 'I will charge a price and if you do not like it you can go somewhere else'. That obviously is not the situation with wheat marketing and the handling of wheat receivals. If my understanding is incorrect I should like the matter explained, but that is the way the legislation reads as it stands at the moment. Further, if the receiver happens to overpay, from whom could there be a recovery if there were a mistake? There was plenty of evidence produced by the Auditor-General of massive mistakes being made in the past in relation to the operation of the wheat marketing scheme. If there were a mistake under this new amendment how could it be picked up? How could the money be recovered? It is my understanding that there is no power to recover an overpayment, as the legislation exists at the moment. If there is a power to recover it I am sure it would be interesting, but otherwise it looks as though the taxpayer may have to pick it up again.

        The Government does not seek, nor wish, a confrontation with the Senate over the tax documents. The responsibility for the investigation and prosecution of possible breaches of the law is vested by the Constitution in the Executive Government. It is an integral part of these responsibiities for the Government to decide what government documents of a legal or investigative character can properly be released in the public interest so as not to prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings that may be brought against alleged offenders against the laws of the Commonwealth. The Government is under the further obligation not to prejudice the fair trial of any alleged offender by the release of information that might reasonably be considered to be prejudicial to his fair trial.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate resolution purports to direct the Government in the manner in which it should exercise its Executive functions. The Government's view is that the Senate does not have the power under the Constitution to determine the manner in which Executive functions are carried out.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Solicitor-General has advised in relation to all the documents sought ( except the tax investigation report, which he has not seen) that disclosure of their contents would be 'harmful to the administration of justice'. The injury which could be caused to parties in the prosecutions by their release could not in his view 'be avoided by excising names'. Several of the documents sought relate to the Perth matter referred to in the Report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Criminal proceedings have already been commenced in that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commissioner of Taxation considers that the same argument applies with greater force to the tax investigation report, which itself deals with the Perth matter. Moreover, he considers that, given that the identity of the individuals concerned in that matter is now public, 'any information at all provided in a so -called ''sanitized'' version would . . . offend against s.16 (of the Income Tax Assessment Act)'. Because of this, the Commissioner considers s.16 prevents him from handing that document to the Minister for the purposes of the resolution. The result is that the resolution purports to direct the Ministers to produce a document which the Commissioner considers cannot lawfully be given to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has demonsrated that it is fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. A Special Prosecutor has been appointed to bring prosecutions in relation to 'bottom-of-the-harbour schemes'. As mentioned above, proceedings have already been commenced in relation to the Perth matter referred to in the Royal Commission report. The Special Prosecutor has announced his intention of investigating the activities of all promoters of 'bottom-of-the-harbour schemes' and of initiating prosecutions as appropriate as soon as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government hopes that those Senators who voted in the majority for the 25 November resolution would recognise that under the Constitution the Government has the responsibility for enforcing the laws of the Commonwealth and for determining, in the manner in which it considers appropriate, and for which it bears responsibility, whether the release of documents would prejudice that responsiblity. The Government also hopes that those Senators would therefore not continue to seek to direct Ministers contrary to their constitutional responsibility as members of the Executive.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the event that a Senate majority seeks to enforce the directions contained in the resolution of 25 November 1982, the Government intends to put the basic legal and constitutional questions in relation to the Senate's powers before the High Court of Australia.

      <para>
       In moving the motion, I state briefly that I find it fascinating that the Government should have chosen to rely not on doctrine of Executive privilege but upon the constitutional high ground that it marked out in its earlier contribution to this debate. I am reminded of the distinction that Jeremy Bentham once drew between mere nonsense, on the one hand, and in the context of natural law, what he described as nonsense on stilts. I cannot forbear but comment that this contribution to the nation's constitutional jurisprudence from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) satisfies that latter description. The Senate, confronted with a claim of this character, ought to do something that obviously cannot be discussed without some further and better thought. For that reason, I do not seek this evening to set in train any procedures. But I think it might be possible for some appropriate reaction to be given tomorrow. I give warning, if that is the appropriate word, to the Government that we may well seek to bring on this matter for debate tomorrow. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act proposed by this Bill seek to address aspects of one of the fundamental structural problems of the Australian industrial relations system, the multiplicy of industrial jurisdictions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The broad purpose of the Bill is to foster greater co-ordination in the work of Federal and State industrial tribunals. This is a significant goal, but it is one which of course cannot be accomplished by means of Commonwealth legislation alone. The wider significance of the legislation is to be found in the agreement of the Commonwealth and the States to enact complementary legislation on the matter. The measures proposed by this Bill provide the response to the implementation of that agreement which is required of the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concepts which underly the provision made in this Bill emanate from consultative arrangements entered into by the Commonwealth and the States with a view to finding means whereby a more complementary system of industrial relations might be brought about.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may know something of these arrangements and the background to the legislation. The Premiers' Conference in June 1979 agreed that Commonwealth and State Ministers for Labour should conduct a review on the question of fundamental changes to the Australian industrial relations system, and the Commonwealth/State Review of Industrial Relations Systems was established.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Working Party set up to carry out this Review put forward a wide range of proposals for consideration by Ministers during 1979-81. These proposals were considered by the National Labour Consultative Council. While consideration was being given by the Commonwealth and the States to a proposed National Inquiry into Wage Determination and Industrial Relations, the review established by the Premiers was suspended.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Premiers' Conference in February 1982 decided, however, not to proceed with the proposed Inquiry, but agreed that a Working Party of Commonwealth and State officials be established with the following terms of reference:
       </para>
       <para>
        'To examine and report on steps which could be taken to achieve:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) a complementary industrial relations system within Australia;
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) more effective liaison between State and Commonwealth industrial jurisdictions.'
       </para>
       <para>
        The Premiers' Conference requested that the Report of the Working Party be presented to the June Premiers' Conference. The Working Party reported to the Conference of Labour Ministers in May 1982 and the report was unanimously adopted by the Ministers who agreed upon its submission to the Premiers. The June 1982 Premiers' Conference agreed to implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should say, Mr President, that the spirit of co-operation which was evident at all stages of the development of the proposals now reflected in the Bill, and at the June 1982 Premiers' Conference, gives promise of further co-operative proposals to bring about a more effective industrial relations system for Australia. The officers' Working Party is continuing to meet and I am confident that further proposals of significance will emerge.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might now turn, Mr President, to consider briefly the character of the industrial problems with which this Bill is concerned. While well recognized in the industrial relations community, they are not generally clearly perceived by the community at large.
       </para>
       <para>
        The power of the Commonwealth to legislate with respect to industrial relations matters is limited to the enactment of laws for the prevention and settlement of interstate industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. Disputes which are wholly within a single State cannot be dealt with by the Federal Commission and not all matters which may be in dispute between employers and employees are ''industrial'' within the meaning of the Constitution. Outside the permissible scope of Commonwealth law the State Legislatures have wide powers. All States have established tribunals to deal with industrial disputes and in each State there are organisations (which may or may not be registered) of employers and employees operating wholly within the State.
       </para>
       <para>
        Particular consequences of these arrangements are first, that no one tribunal, Commonwealth or State, may have jurisdiction to deal with what is in effect but may not be in law a single dispute or with closely related disputes, and that second, it is difficult to co-ordinate the decision-making activities of the tribunals and to bring about uniformity in the principles and policies applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some efforts have been made in recent years to ameliorate the problems arising from the divided industrial jurisdictions and to bring about a measure of co- ordination in the work of industrial tribunals. The President of the Australian Commission, Sir John Moore, has since 1976 convened meetings of the Heads of Commonwealth and State industrial tribunals. Initially held annually, the meetings are now convened each 6 months and have been widely supported as effective in promoting co-operation and co-ordination between tribunals. Furthermore, to meet particular industrial situations, such as where part of an industry is covered by a State and part by a Federal award, or because one of 2 unions competing for work was covered by State and not Federal registration, the Australian Commission has conducted joint conferences and joint hearings on an informal basis with an industrial tribunal in a State. It is desirable that such a practice be put on a statutory footing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, for the benefit of honourable senators, I will proceed now to outline the particular provisions made by this Bill. In short, the Bill provides for:
       </para>
       <para>
        joint sittings of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and a State Tribunal;
       </para>
       <para>
        expansion of the powers of Local Industrial Boards (when constituted by a State Industrial Authority) to permit them to exercise Federal jurisdiction;
       </para>
       <para>
        the exercise, by agreement, of State jurisdiction by the Australian Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        JOINT PROCEEDINGS OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE TRIBUNALS
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions made by the Bill are intended to provide a proper statutory footing for the conduct of a joint sitting of a State tribunal and the Commonwealth Commission. In terms of the proposal developed by the Working Party it is envisaged that each tribunal, while it would sit with the other and hear the matter simultaneously, would exercise only the powers conferred by its own constitutive legislation and would make a separate decision (though ideally in identical terms) in its own jurisdiction. The appeal, reference and review provisions applicable by reasons of the constitutive legislation of each tribunal would apply to a decision made in the jurisdiction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision made in the Bill, while guaranteeing the validity of the joint sitting arrangement, does not fetter the discretion of the President of the Commission in deciding to initiate a joint sitting or to respond to a request from a State Tribunal for such a sitting. Similarly the President is not limited in his capacity to determine the timing of a joint sitting such as whether the sitting is to be held at the conciliation or arbitration stage of proceedings-or as to termination of the sitting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government considers that such a provision will be of considerable utility in circumstances referred to above, such as where State and Federal unions are involved in a demarcation dispute or where neither the Federal or State jurisdiction has complete coverage of an industry. In the latter case, a joint sitting could be convened in such circumstances as where:
       </para>
       <para>
        A Federally registered union makes an application to the Commission for variation of an award and proceedings have commenced in a State industrial jurisdiction in respect of a State award or determination dealing with employees in occupations the same or similar to those in which members of the Federal union are engaged;
       </para>
       <para>
        A log of claims is served by a Federally registered union, a dispute is notified in the Federal Commission and proceedings have commenced in a State tribunal in respect of an award or determination dealing with employees in the same or similar categories of work to those covered in the Federal log.
       </para>
       <para>
        POWERS OF LOCAL INDUSTRIAL BOARDS
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as it stands a member of the Commission may refer a matter to a Local Industrial Board for investigation and report. A Local Industrial Board may be constituted by Representatives of employers and employees with a Chairman, or by a State Industrial Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        New arrangements proposed by the Bill will permit the President of the Commission to refer a matter to a Local Industrial Board constituted by a State Industrial authority and that Authority will be empowered to settle the dispute by conciliation or arbitration or both as appropriate. In performing these functions the Local Industrial Board will be exercising Federal jurisdiction and will be able to exercise powers under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principal benefits of such an arrangement are twofold. First, circumstances may arise in which a member of the Australian Commission is not immediately available to deal with a dispute but a member of the State Industrial Authority is able to proceed to deal with the matter at short notice. Disputes occurring in remote locations are particularly amenable to such proceedings. Second, situations arise in which a dispute at a local level may affect both State and Federal jurisdictions (such as where employees in a single enterprise are covered by both State and Federal awards) and it is appropriate for a member of a State tribunal to proceed to settle the matter in both jurisdictions.
       </para>
       <para>
        EMPOWERING OF FEDERAL COMMISSION TO DEAL WITH DISPUTES IN A STATE JURISDICTION
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of the agreement reached by the Commonwealth and the States it is envisaged that, in appropriate circumstances, the President of a State Industrial authority would be able to request the President of the Commission to exercise the jurisdiction of the State tribunal. In such circumstances the powers of the member of the commission exercising the State jurisdiction would be given by the legislation of the State concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, it is intended that the powers of the Australian Commission in relation to the Joint Proceedings and Local Industrial Board provision made by this Bill will be exercised only in relation to such State Industrial authorities as are prescribed. As State Parliaments enact legislation to give effect to the agreement as to Complementary Industrial Relations Systems, the Commonwealth will, for its part, make regulations to give force to the amendments proposed by this Bill in respect of particular State industrial tribunals.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I suggested at the outset, Mr President, the significance of this Bill lies perhaps as much in the fact that it is a manifestation of a co-operative approach by the Commonwealth and the States to the resolution of industrial relations problems as in the specific provision made. The Government is optimistic that this process will continue and bear further fruit.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation is designed to repeal the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920 and to vest the jurisdiction under that Act on the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments recognize that the structure and range of Commonwealth Public Service employment and the functions of the Public Service Arbitrator have changed considerably since the establishment of a separate jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator in 1920. Honourable Senators will recall that the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration took the same view in its Report of 1976 and recommended that action be taken along the lines of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is proposed is a natural progression from the statutory links between the jurisdictions of the Arbitrator and of the Commission (and of the Arbitration Court before it) that were established in the 1950's when the system of appeals and references to the Commission from the Arbitrator was introduced. A further alignment occurred between the jurisdictions in 1972 when the concept of an industrial situation was injected into the Public Service Arbitration Act to give the Arbitrator scope to deal with industrial action in the public sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation has been the subject of intensive examination by the NLCC and a special Committee of the Council. The ACTU supports the Bill's objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, a new Division 1A is to be inserted into Part III of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and this will encompass the areas of Commonwealth employment presently covered by the Public Service Arbitration Act. Certain Northern Territory Government Service employment will also be covered by the new Division.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should point out here-and it is an important point-that certain areas of Commonwealth activity which presently do not come within the scope of the Public Service Arbitration Act will not be the subject of the Commission's jurisdiction under the new Division but will remain within the Commission's general jurisdiction under Division 1 of Part III of the Act. I speak here, for example, of such enterprises as Qantas, the Australian National Line, TAA and the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions. However, provision has been made in the Bill for the transfer by regulation of Commonwealth and Territory authorities and employees as defined between Division 1A and other Divisions of the Act as appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, provision has been made for the President to have power to arrange for specific matters to be dealt with by a panel in a Division other than 1A and vice versa to cater for situations where it is desirable that similar matters in each Division be heard by the one panel.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would point out to the Senate that the jurisdiction of the Fire Brigades and the Prison Officers Tribunals in the Northern Territory will not be immediately drawn into the jurisdiction of the Commission. The relevant unions in the Northern Territory are presently covered by separate Tribunals and require time to make the necessary arrangements which will leave them free to move into the Commission's jurisdiction. The Government is prepared to leave the operation of the process of rationalization as to these tribunals in abeyance for the time being. The provisions of the Bill as to them can be brought into operation by Regulation when there has been further consultation about them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the main details of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 9 inserts the new Division 1A into Part III of the Act and it will embrace a number of new sections designed to empower the Commission to deal with industrial disputes and industrial matters concerning Commonwealth and Territory employees. Proposed Section 70A contains relevant definitions for these purposes and provides for the exclusion from the new Division 1A of members of the Defence Force, the Australian Postal Commission, the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian National Railways Commission. Other specified Authorities such as the Australian Shipping Commission, if not brought within Division 1A by Regulation will remain within the general jurisdiction of the Commission. Provision has also been made for the exclusion of certain other employees who are not presently within the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed section 70B removes the limitations imposed by the definition of '' industrial dispute'' and ''industrial matter'' in section 4 of the Act. The new Section 70C extends the Panel system for the hearing and determination of matters to the new Division.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of new Sections 70G and 70H is to provide for the transfer where appropriate of the hearing and determination of a matter from the new Division to another Division or vice versa. This is similar to the procedures already in the Act which allow the President flexibility in the allocation of matters to be determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 70J will effectively carry over to Division 1A the powers of the Public Service Arbitrator under section 12D of the Public Service Arbitration Act in relation to orders made to end or prevent industrial action.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed section 70K will give the Commission power to declare terms of awards to be Common Rules for the whole or a part of Government Service.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 5 of the Bill deals with section 36 of the Principal Act and the right of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to intervene in matters before the Commission. The Minister already has such a right in proceedings involving significant matters before the Commission. That right will now be extended to all matters involving disputes in the Commonwealth public sector. This does not mean that the Minister will enter proceedings in all such cases- far from it. But the Government has decided to reserve to itself the right, as a most significant employer and in the public interest generally, to put views to the Commission in relation to its own area of employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other important elements of the Bill are in Clauses 11 and 15. Clause 11 inserts a new sub-section 132 (5) in the Act to provide for the continuance of the registration of associations of less than 100 employees which were registered under the authority of the Public Service Arbitration Act. The registration of such bodies is not to be cancelled by virtue of sub-section 132 (1) (B) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act unless their membership falls below sixty per cent of the number of employees in the relevant industry in the Public Service.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 15 makes certain transitional arrangements to enable, for example, determinations of the Arbitrator to continue in force and matters pending under the Public Service Arbitration Act before its repeal to be dealt with.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, when this Bill was before the House, certain amendments were moved by the Minister. These were adopted by the House. The amendments were made to clauses 3, 9 and 11.

       <para>
        Three of these amendments derived from certain matters brought to the Minister' s attention by the ACOA and the ACTU after they had studied the Bill. They represent a response to what was put to the Minister and in discussions that took place between the ACOA and ACTU officials with Departmental officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me explain in some detail what the amendments were about.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Public Service Arbitration Act deems public sector employment to be an industry for the purpose of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act so that an organisation may be registered by reference to that industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Government Service Bill classes public sector employment to be an industry, the wording of the Bill before amendment restricted that to the prevention and settlement of public sector disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not the intention of the Bill to take away the basis for public sector employment being deemed to be in an industry for the purposes of registration of an organisation under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The amendments rectified those defects.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a spirit of proper consultation, the terms of the amendments to be moved in the House were given to the ACTU and the ACOA to inform them of the Government's intentions.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was then some correspondence on technical points between the ACOA and the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department received a letter from the ACOA which said, and I quote:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''Generally speaking the drafting satisfies the substantial point raised about the treatment of Australian Government Employment as an industry for purposes of the Act''.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then the letter went on to, nevertheless, express some reservations about the amendments. The Department replied to that letter. The gist of the reply was that we could see no reason to depart from what was in the amendments ultimately made by the House. The correspondence between the Minister and the ACOA and ACTU and between the Department and the ACOA is available should Honourable Senators wish to see it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another amendment adopted by the House and proposed by the Minister stemmed from the Conciliation and Arbitration (Complementary Industrial Relations System ) Amendment Bill 1982 which is presently before the Senate. That Bill inserts a new Section 44B in Division I of Part III of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 empowering the Commission to refer disputes to State Industrial Authorities. The Bill includes provisions excluding the operation of that section in disputes concerning the Snowy Mountains Authority or Commonwealth projects. The amendment adopted by the House is a consequential one and of a formal nature to ensure that the provisions of the Government Service Bill dealing with Commonwealth Government employment are excluded from the operation of section 44B.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, as I have pointed out, the proposals set out in this Bill have been the subject of detailed consultation with the Labour Movement and have its general endorsement.

        I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators.

        â€”The Asian Development Fund Bill 1982 is a very important piece of legislation. Through it we propose to make from our 1982-83 Budget a contribution of $212,332,030 towards the Asian Development Fund . Whilst the Opposition does not oppose the Bill, it does have some reservations about the way in which it is proposed that our contribution shall be used by the Asian Development Bank through the agency of the Asian Development Fund. It is true that the Whitlam Labor Government was responsible for the establishment of this Fund in 1974. The motives behind its establishment were of the highest order. The Bill to establish the Fund and the objectives set forth for that Fund were designed to assist in the proper, orderly development of countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. One wonders whether in subsequent years that objective has been properly realised in the allocation of money by what one might call the more developed countries to assist the underdeveloped countries in our region. To that extent the situation with the Asian Development Fund is critical.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The original purpose of the Fund was to provide substantial assistance in the creation of infrastructure for the underdeveloped countries in our region-to provide infrastructure such as transport, communication, power and irrigation facilities, water supplies, urban development and everything that is essential for the orderly development of a country so that its inhabitants can enjoy a standard of living comparable to that of the Western powers. One is therefore entitled to attempt to determine whether that objective has been realised. In recent years a substantial degree of industrialisation has taken place within the countries concerned and, in a majority of those countries, it has not materially improved the living standards of the people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our form of assistance has been to provide the sort of public funding that has enabled industrialisation and a vicious form of exploitation of the work force in most of those countries. It seems that much of the money which has gone to these countries has been spent on agricultural development and what is left has gone towards infrastructure. What has been most disturbing this year has been the degree to which the Australian Government has been required to increase it contribution from 5.14 per cent to 7.2 per cent of the needed funds, while at the same time the richest country in the world, the United States of America, has seen fit to reduce its contribution. That has the effect not only of reducing the total sum available to those countries but also of reducing the objectives of the scheme, to which I have referred.
      </para>
      <para>
       One can therefore understand the critical note of the very eminent President of the World Bank, who plays a significant role in allocating sufficient funds for the development of Third World countries. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       For the first time in 50 years the United States is saying that it cannot afford to continue increasing its aid program.
      </para>
      <para>
       When one considers the mammoth increase in armaments that the Reagan Administration is putting before the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate in the insane arms race between the super-powers, one can understand why the United States has taken that extraordinary step of reducing its normal contribution. The purpose of the Fund was to have the countries that may be described as haves contribute towards the have-nots. The Australian Labor Party does not quibble with that objective. Australia is in the same sort of conservative or monetarist bind that has plagued countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The present Administration of the United States takes the view that the Third World should rely mainly on private capital and market forces to overcome the problems of development. It then exercises its influence through the World Bank and the Asian Development Fund to propagate that monetarist view that market forces and private capital should be the basis of the strategy applied in the development of the Third World countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       That gives emphasis to the Labor Party's criticism of this legislation. Just as those policies are failing in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia in the domestic sense they will fail to provide the essential steps that need to be taken in the Third World countries to raise living standards. With the rapid industrialisation that is taking place in our neighbouring countries, whether they be in the Asian region or the Pacific region, we see differentiations taking place. Some of those countries have to contend with private capital invested for the purposes of exploitation and for the development of consumer goods which then have their effect on world markets, the Australian market in particular. It is our funds that are providing the additional public revenues either for agricultural development or for infrastructure to produce the means by which the private sector can carry on its exploitation. Of course, as we know, many of the countries to which I refer have despotic leaders, authoritarian regimes and governments that are not basically concerned with the living standards of their people but rather with assisting the multinational and transnational companies viciously to exploit the cheap labour that is a feature of the countries within our region.
      </para>
      <para>
       We must have a policy of differentiation in this area because in a sense the countries in our region are now in three different categories. The advanced countries have high technology, microchip and the electronic industries. They are producing consumer goods at a rapid rate with cheap labour, and in a highly competitive world market these goods create difficulties for countries such as Australia. In other countries in our region industrialisation is taking place without the advent of modern advanced high technology. Other countries, particularly in the Pacific region, have economies of a somewhat primitive nature.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Asian Development Bank and the Australian Government have a partisan approach to the way in which the funds are allocated. I refer, for example, to their refusal to assist properly in the rehabilitation and development of countries such as Vietnam, where Western powers-the United States and Australia- carried out policies of destroying the economy and the countryside. This Government and the United States Government have refused to honour the obligations, to which they agreed at the time of the Paris peace talks and the finalisation of Western intervention, to give that country the sort of aid that is essential for it to rehabilitate itself and establish a more reasonable economy. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) suggested during a debate in the House of Representatives, it is a criminal shame we apply such policies to countries within our region, such as Vietnam, which require the assistance of the developed countries to overcome the ravages of war when it sought only to establish a form of self-determination and found itself heavily invaded, bombarded and partially destroyed by countries such as the United States and Australia. The Development Fund and the Development Bank are being used as instruments to pursue foreign policies which are inimical to the better interests of the region. They follow economic policies which have been proven to be against the best interests of the people in the region.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators on both sides of the chamber have raised questions recently about funds from the Asian Development Bank being applied to countries such as the Philippines, which has an authoritarian, martial law type government. It uses money from the Asian Development Fund to provide an infrastructure which enables it to maintain an authoritarian regime which is against the best interests and proper development of that country. The philosophy of the conservatives of market forces and private capital, as expressed by the President of the United States, is the strategy that has been applied to this region. The Asian Development Fund is part of that process. Therefore, the original motivation and strategy behind the establishment of the Fund is being perverted by governments such as those in Australia and the United States, which misapply the principles on which the Fund was originally established. Whilst we see this differentiation within the region and, to some extent, the degree of economic growth surpasses that of some of the developed countries, we are nevertheless making a substantial contribution to the Fund. The Senate should be concerned about this. An amount of $212m in the current financial year is a substantial contribution to the Fund.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have seen other examples of the way in which funds have been misapplied as a result of the policies being pursued by this Government. Honourable senators will recall, for example, the so-called assistance given to Fiji by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Australian Broadcasting Commission exposed how the funds were applied to keep in office a conservative government of the same ilk as the Fraser Government and not to help the people of Fiji. Rather than the noble sentiments and objectives which were the purpose of the original fund, we see this distortion taking place in the way in which the funds are being applied . But having said that, it is better to have the funds applied in the region than to take the negative position of not giving assistance to the countries of the region at all. Even though I believe our criticism of the way in which the funds are being applied is valid, nevertheless some positive contribution is being made. The poorer and least developed countries in the region are being given some assistance, even though we certainly quarrel with the way in which the Fund is operated.
      </para>
      <para>
       I heartily endorse the very critical note that was taken by Mr Lionel Bowen when this matter was being debated in the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, having regard to the time constraints which we have in the Senate on the second last day of this sitting, I will leave my remarks at that point. I hope that the Government will examine what the Opposition has said in both Houses of Parliament about the operation of the Asian Development Fund and heed our criticism, with a view to improving the fund and making it a much more efficient instrument for improving the living standards of the people in our region.

        â€”As Senator Gietzelt has indicated, the Asian Development Fund Bill is an important Bill. I find it desirable to speak, because although the Bill is witness to the fact that the Australian Government will not avoid international responsibilities at a time of domestic economic difficulty, the Government nevertheless should continue that policy in the knowledge that it has the very positive support of members of this chamber. Already there is pressure to reconsider our aid commitments. I noticed only a matter of days ago that one State Premier stated that such a move would be a good starting point when looking at our economic woes. In the same mould, in September of last year Ronald Reagan stated:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Unless a nation puts its own financial and economic house in order, no amount of aid will produce progress.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is of course true, as far as it goes. But what he could also have said is that to keep up the aid program will be a little harder for the average American or, in our case, for the average Australian. But nevertheless, relatively, his position remains beyond comparison.
      </para>
      <para>
       I remind the Senate of portion of the excellent speech given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the University of South Carolina in July of last year on the subject, 'The Third World and the West' in which he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       According to the World Bank, not a body given to emotional exaggeration, 800 million people are living in conditions of absolute poverty in the Third World. The infant mortality rate in low income Third World countries is 12 times as high as that in Western countries. Life expectancy in them is still under 50 years. Thousands are dying every week from malnutrition and outright starvation.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the situation reaches that stage, the question must be asked: What does aid achieve? At the very basic level it is humanitarian, keeping people alive, providing basic essentials for life. From there it moves into what John F. Kennedy said in 1961 would contribute to:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . move more than half the people of the less developed nations into self sustained economic growth while the rest move substantially closer to the day when they, too, will no longer have to depend on outside assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       But as countries reach that stage, they proceed to prove that every nation prospers by the prosperity of others. Over 70 per cent of the Third World trade is with the developed industrialised countries. Over one-third of Western trade is with the Third World. Each strengthens the other. So if humanitarian justification is insufficient, if an economic justification is necessary, then that is it. But there is a further justification that is strategic. The speech of the Prime Minister, to which I have just referred, reminded me of Edmund Burke, who said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Discontent will increase with misery.
      </para>
      <para>
       The record of the Eastern bloc in economic aid has been poor. The Soviet Union gives only 0.04 per cent of gross national product in aid. It gives the West a tremendous opportunity to show by example the material benefits that free industrialised nations can offer. With that comes a closer and more meaningful relationship. The average assistance of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries at the moment is about 0.3 per cent of GNP. There has, of course, been a great deal of activity in recent years to bridge the economic chasm between the rich North and the poor South. As we know, Robert S. McNamara, as President of the World Bank, advocated in 1977 the formation of an independent commission on international development issues. The Brandt Commission, as it is now known, was set up to report on-I quote from its terms of reference-the following:
      </para>
      <para>
       The global issues arising from the economic and social disparities of the world community and to suggest ways of promoting adequate solutions to the problems involved in development and in attacking absolute poverty.
      </para>
      <para>
       It called for a major increase in the transfer of resources from the developed nations to the developing and undeveloped and a summit meeting of world leaders to enable initiatives and concessions to be threshed out with candour and boldness. The summit at Cancun has come and gone with progress described in the terms of Willy Brandt, the Chairman of the Commission I mentioned, as progress in millimetres. The heads of state representing both the North and the South met for only two days and passed the need to continue global negotiations to what was described in one volume of the Economist last year as that drones' hive of indecision, the United Nations. What progress has been made? At the Versailles meeting earlier this year of major industrialised nations their leaders said:
      </para>
      <para>
       There is now a good prospect for the early launching and success of global negotiations.
      </para>
      <para>
       They said that the European Economic Community would prepare a draft resolution based on that circulated earlier by the so-called group of 77 developing nations . In other words, drafts are being prepared and that is the degree of progress being made. Global negotiations will be slow. Whether they can ever lead anywhere is questionable. Some commentators are now referring to the Cancun cul- de-sac.
      </para>
      <para>
       What is of particular relevance to this Bill is that the multilateral development banks-both the World Bank and the regional banks-continue to play a worthwhile role in the development needs of the Third World. One such bank is, of course, the Asian Development Bank. Many of the issues facing the Asian Development Fund, the soft lending facility of the ADB, are the same in a larger way as those facing the International Development Association, the soft lending facility of the World Bank. The most major of those obstacles has been the attitude of recent United States administrations, and of Congress debates, as to whether this kind of lending, the multilateral kind of lending, is in the best interests of the United States. It raises the question of loans going to countries opposed to United States foreign policy. But in doing so it is really pointing to the strength of multilateral agencies. That the donor has less direct influence over terms and conditions upon which recipients receive funds, either in the nature of economic development or in foreign policy demands, might be in the best interests of the developing world. Development needs have a better opportunity of being the principle inducement. It is also the American view that the greatest share of loans should go to countries which have shown an ability to help themselves. In other words, there is better value there than pouring money after poverty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also there is criticism that the lending concentrates too much on the public sector rather than encouraging a vigorous private sector. Both these points ignore the fact that building up the necessary economic infrastructure on which an industrial take-off can be based requires large amounts of money to be applied for long periods, especially in the public sector. These problems face the ADF today. The Far Eastern Economic Review, in its 1981 review, considered the ADF to be the most exposed such body to increasing United States lukewarmness to multilateral aid and general budget cuts. That situation of concern has in fact proved valid. There has been a fall in the contribution of the United States, as was indicated by Senator Gietzelt. The annual United States contribution to the 1982 replenishment was $520m, which represented a fall in United States proportional contributions from 22 per cent to 16 per cent . The shortfall was made up by other countries. Japan increased its share from 33 per cent to 38 per cent and Australia increased its share from 5 per cent to 7 per cent. France also increased its contribution. This reduction by the United States is, of course, to be regretted. It indicates that the industrialised nations of the region are going to have to shoulder a larger share of the region 's economic needs.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is, however, regretted because the Asian Development Bank has played a part in the excellent economic performance of the last decade of the newly industrialised countries of Asia-Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. It has also contributed to the strong agricultural performance and rapid industrial progress of the four middle income countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations-Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. Singapore is excluded as being inappropriate to that description. All, excluding the Philippines, were among the 20 fastest growing economies in the world over the past 10 years. Some have moved from the highly concessional loans of the ADF to loans from ordinary capital resources. It is in the south Asian countries such as Burma, Japan, Bangladesh-which has an annual income per capita of less than $120-and Sri Lanka where problems are most severe. The Far Eastern Economic Review in April 1982 stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       A substantial proportion of the population, which continues to expand at a rapid pace, is without adequate employment, malnourished, suffers from disease, has no access to safe drinking water and is illiterate. Given the poorly developed institutions, it is clear only by concerted, sustained efforts can meaningful progress be made in these DMCs. Thus poverty will remain a daunting problem in the South Asian countries for the foreseeable future and continued progress there will require additional concessionary lending. This is due to the limited access these countries have to commercial sources as well as the difficulty they have in accumulating foreign exchange and local revenue for urgent development projects and programmes.
      </para>
      <para>
       It does not mean that all is yet rosy in ASEAN. With the exception of Singapore, income inequalities remain substantial and poverty incidence, particularly in rural areas, remains acute. Employment growth has not been sufficient to absorb the additions to the labour force. Labour productivity has gown slowly and real wages in some areas have stagnated. A bias towards capital intensive industrialisation has done much to aggravate the problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       In those circumstances, it is pleasing that the Bank has recognised the need for a more flexible approach. It has recognised the value of promoting simpler and cheaper intermediate technology. It has increased its assistance to agriculture, which now comprises its largest share, followed by energy. Without energy little development can take place. Priority has been given to the provision of adequate social infrastructure, which includes water supply, sewerage, housing, education and health facilities. But what is most pleasing is that the Bank has oriented its ADF money towards the extremely poor. In 1981 almost 92 per cent of special funding loans went to developing member countries which had a per capita gross national product of less than $300 in the previous year, 1980. In 1981 Bangladesh received the largest amount of ADF loans, $191m, followed by Pakistan, $155m; Burma, $59.5m; Nepal, $45.2m; Sri Lanka, 35.5m.
      </para>
      <para>
       According to the 1981 annual report of the Bank, in the three instances in which ADF resources were provided to middle income countries-the Technical Education Project in Papua New Guinea, the Palawan Integrated Area Development Project in the Philippines and the Medium-Scale Irrigation Project in Thailand-' Care has been taken to target these schemes at poor people'. In such circumstances, it appears to me that the Government should be congratulated for upgrading its support for the ADF, particularly in these difficult times. It is obvious that the ADB is conscious of the overall social, economic and political requirements of development and is making a very worthwhile contribution in the region. It is equally obvious that for humanitarian long term economic and strategic reasons it should be supported.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having said that, it is always necessary to touch upon areas of concern-the problems which those who are interested in this subject will have to reflect upon in the future. One is the position of Vietnam. The ADB's position remains that conditions in the country do not provide a reasonable basis for new lending or for a revival of earlier projects. But if we are genuinely concerned about the region's poor and if assistance is independent of political considerations the problem of Vietnam will require reassessment. Following the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, the ADB asked the Afghan Government to cease requests for disbursements of committed loans or to ask for new ones. The policy, which can be justified on safety reasons by the staff of the Bank, conveniently fits American foreign policy. But this may not mean that assistance is going where it is most needed.
      </para>
      <para>
       India has indicated its intention in the future to resume soft loan borrowings. The ADF could not support aid at the proportion envisaged by India. This could lead to a major crisis within the Bank and for its donors in the not too distant future. There is also the chance of a request from China for funds. Requests for membership by China would have to be viewed against the existing membership of Taiwan and difficulties there can be envisaged. Some commentators argue that the strongest impulse for the establishment of the ADB came from Japan on the basis that it was in Japan's regional interests, particularly its need to secure supplies of raw materials and foodstuffs and to provide an outlet for expanded exports. Whilst that objective is not to be condemned, the ADF is now virtually dependent on Japan. It is in Australia's interests, therefore, to look to a broadening of the base of support. There is the difficult problem touched upon by Brandt when he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Multilateral lending agencies could usefully give help for adjustment and institutional reforms associated with programs for agrarian reform.
      </para>
      <para>
       Can the Bank interfere in the internal running of a country? If so, how far can it go? Clearly there is no point in increasing poor nations' wealth-I think this point was touched upon by Senator Gietzelt-through aid if it is simply going to the few wealthy. There is little dispute that social and political reforms are often as important in the achievement of an equitable form of economic development as the availability of adequate capital resources. As I have indicated, there is evidence that the ADF is generally heading in the right direction. But the matter needs constant review.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we add to these problems the associated policy of increasing protectionism by the North and the problems associated with large debts and interest servicing it is obvious that, although the Minister said the bank has continued to approach its complex development task with flexibility and vigour, it will require in addition to such qualities wisdom in the years ahead. Australia must accept its responsibility-as was also stated in the Minister's speech-to play its role fully.

        â€”The Australian Democrats support the Asian Development Fund Bill 1982. Indeed, we applaud the Government for ensuring that Australia has a continued and increased commitment towards helping some of the world's poorest nations to come to grips with their problems. The Asian Development Bank is a vitally important institution, tending as it does to support increasingly the very basic areas of work such as improved water storage , health and population control projects. This Bill will provide $212m to the Bank this year increasing Australia's share from 5.14 per cent to 7.2 per cent. We are very much preoccupied in this country with our own problems of recession and unemployment. But I think we would all agree that serious though those problems are, they are not as bad as those faced by Third World nations. It is also a fact that as our problems increase so too do the problems of other countries, but theirs to a greater extent than our own.

       I was very shocked to read a story from an African newspaper some weeks ago about a group of old and infirm people who were among a group of refugees sitting in a camp somewhere in Africa. After due deliberation, thought and consideration they decided that they would voluntarily poison themselves-commit mass suicide-so that a greater share of the miserable food resources would be available for the children so that those children might live. That in itself was a very noble and dignified act carried out by noble and dignified people almost in obscurity. I think that probably a huge proportion of the human race now sees such things happening and that often we do not even know that those things are going on. Indeed, if it is one world and humanity is one people, we have failed very sadly the greater majority of our fellow humans when things of that kind happen.

       I believe it would be the most selfish, carping and miserable of opinions that we should cut back on this kind of assistance to people who are less fortunate than ourselves because of our own problems in the knowledge that those cutbacks meant certain death to people who suffer from poverty, famine and disease through no fault of their own. It is a fact that these people, like ourselves, are caught up in the whirlwind of world happenings and they have no control over their fate to the stage where many who are born in those countries die before they are even at the age where they can exert any control over their own affairs whatsoever. It is my opinion that for those kinds of reasons the great majority of Australians support the Government in this allocation of funds. However, I agree with Senator Gietzelt that a careful watch must be kept on how this money is spent. The demonstrated need is so enormous and the resources so small in contrast with that need that every dollar must be spent in the most fully effective way. This is not, unfortunately, always the case. Human nature being what it is, it is a natural and regrettable tendency for money devoted to purposes like this to be concentrated more and more on administration rather than practical efforts. It is easier simply to set up some sort of administrative group, and administration, of course, proliferates on itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       My own experience in the Asian countries, unfortunately, shows that they are almost better at doing this than we are ourselves, and that is saying something. Still worse, this money can be diverted to people who do not really need it or who find dubious but still legal ways of using it for their own ends. This has been done in many countries of Asia with the greatest possible cynicism. I think it is a reflection of the views of a class of people who find themselves at the top of the heap, but who see their position as precarious and who see their preservation and their children's preservation as being of more importance than the least fortunate people in their own country. That is a tendency we must recognise. We must use our own influence, whenever we can, to overcome it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I could not agree with Senator Gietzelt-I do not think he said this, but he implied it-that the existence of an authoritarian regime in itself must debar a nation from help by the bank. Indeed, it is probable that those countries are the ones which need it most. The extent to which an outside nation can interfere in how a recipient nation runs its own affairs can, however, be quite effective, even if difficult. This does not have to be overt; it certainly should not be that way. The adage: 'He who pays the piper calls the tune', is always true. We ought not to be too coy in calling the tune in such matters. There again, that is a fine line to be walked.

       It is wrong, as happened in India I think from both sides of the zonal conflict , that a country should be punished because of the political view of its government at that time. At the same time, we should not believe that we can safely isolate ourselves, with any conscience, from the vast majority of human beings who are poorer than ourselves. This should be an absolute fundamental of our view of the world. John Donne said: 'No man is an island.' We would be foolish indeed to believe that we could continue to exist and prosper in the midst of a surrounding sea of poverty. Like Senator Hill-I applaud him for his comments-I deplore those statements which we, unfortunately, now see and hear in this community in increasing numbers. It is said that we ought to cut back on foreign aid to the benefit of some domestic cause. In our own interests that has to be resisted.

        â€”in reply-I thank honourable senators for their support of this legislation. That support has come from all quarters of the Senate. There are one or two points to which I would like to refer. Senator Hill drew our attention to the fact-I think Senator Gietzelt mentioned it also-that there has generally been a decrease in the amount of support coming from the, if you like, developed nations for the Asian Development Bank. Certainly in this replenishment there will be a drop in the contribution by the United States of America to the Bank. It should be noted , however, that there is a significant increase in the proportion of funds coming from sources now identified as very well developed countries in this region; I instance Japan. Certainly Japan's proportion compared with the last replenishment has increased from 33.7 per cent to 37.8 per cent. Australia, with a significantly smaller population than that of Japan, has increased its proportion from 5.14 per cent to 7.2 per cent. I think it has to be acknowledged that, while saying that the United States has taken less interest in this activity compared with previous years, certainly the slack, if you like, has been taken up, as it appears, with great alacrity by countries which are part of this region. That is a significant trend in the development of care and assistance for Asian nations as has been well identified by Senator Mason in his remarks.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I was fortunate enough last year, as Minister Assisting the Treasurer, to attend the annual general meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Honolulu. I had the opportunity of having discussions with many leaders, not only those whose countries are in need and are borrowers from the Bank, but also those whose countries contribute heavily to programs. The kinds of points that were made by Senator Mason in relation to the poorer nations I think are things that are uppermost in the minds of those who are contributing. There is a genuine spirit of assistance within the Bank as a whole. I commend both staff and directors of the Bank for their altruism and their approach to the development of Asia as a whole.
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude these very brief remarks by commending further Australia's commitment to this very fine enterprise. It is a relatively recent one in terms of the development of this area of the world. The total funding provided by the Asian Development Bank I think is of the order of $10,000m. Of that Australia has contributed quite worthily in recent years. The proportion, as I said, which Australia is contributing is growing and has reached a total of 7.2 per cent. This latest replenishment amounting to some $212.33m is a very significant development in this area of the world. I think all Australians recognise the need to assist those nations that are in the poorer categories. It is a very important factor for all of us to recognise that in fact countries which are in the lesser developed areas-those that are generally the poorer nations-are probably those which will be most affected and which are being most affected by the current downturn in world trade.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, there are many factors which mitigate against the development of Asian nations. Those have been canvassed in other debates. I speak of the trading policies of various nations in relation to primary produce and those things which are complimentary to the economic produce of Asian nations. That is another argument. Let us, at this point of time, acknowledge the very significant contribution of Australia to the Asian Development Bank. The Bank consists of a very dedicated group of people who work out of Manila and who are providing significant benefits and development funds for Asia generally.

         â€”In introducing this legislation on 25 August this year, the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, said that the Defence Force Discipline Bill-a 100-page Bill designed to produce a complete new code of military law in this country-was the outcome of a 'prolonged review of the existing law'. That is a masterly understatement. The process of producing a new code of military discipline law in this country began 36 years ago with the report of Mr Justice Reed of the punishment and trial of military offences, which report was completed in 1946.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It was not until the Labor Government came to office in 1972 and generated some momentum in this area as in so many other areas that a further report was produced and tabled in this Parliament on 2 April 1974 from a working party which had been established the previous year. We are told that this Bill is based on that report. The report itself was the subject of considerable comment by members of parliament, members of the public and, of course, members of the Defence Force. Following that, there was a conference in November 1978 chaired by the then Minister for Defence. Now, four years later, we have this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Needless to say, at the end of that process, the Opposition does, in fact, welcome its final appearance. We cannot help but ask ourselves why it has all taken so long. A number of reasons suggest themselves, but I think Senator Durack partly at least gave the game away by revealing in his second reading speech that the Attorney-General's Department was involved in the review of the law in question. We all know what that means. Having the Attorney-General's Department, under the present Attorney's administration, involved in any law reform project is like driving with the brake on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Be that as it may, it would be churlish to do otherwise than to welcome, unequivocally, the arrival of the Bill. Certainly, the Bill will-as the second reading speech, which it appears was largely written by the then Defence Minister, Sir James Killen, as his swan song in that portfolio, colourfully illustrates-bring the law and the procedure governing discipline of the Defence Force headlong into the twentieth century. That is no mean feat. No longer will there be as part of Australian military law the offence of negligent drum beating. Nor will there be, as part of our military law, offences relating to the exploitation of sutlers. For those who are not in the know about these matters, sutlers, it appears, follow an army and sell provisions to soldiers. With this legislation we are showing signs at last of getting into the area of modern enlightened criminal law.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not oppose the Bill, nor do we seek to delay its passage. I do feel obliged to indicate that we are by no means happy with every detail of it although, again, we are realistic enough to acknowledge that perfection in this kind of complex legislation, albeit after 36 years of endeavour, is virtually unattainable and we do not stand too much on the lack of perfection in every respect of this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me quickly, however, point to not only some of the weaknesses of the Bill but also its strengths. I think its primary strengths are that in general terms it does amount to almost a complete codification of the law, thus producing a much greater degree of certainty and uniformity in what has hitherto been very much a dog's breakfast. Secondly, in general terms it does reflect, finally at last, the abolition of our dependence in this respect on United Kingdom legislation-a welcome trend, as this is, representing the legal emancipation of Australia, which grinds slowly on as the Federation now enters its ninth decade. The other useful thing, of course, accomplished by this Bill is that it will provide in very large, if not total, measure uniformity as between the rules applying to each of the three Services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the particular merits of the Bill seem to me to be the automatic review that is provided for in clauses 151 and 152 of convictions and punishments and also the requirment in clause 70 that Service tribunals are to have regard to articulated sentencing principles. That is not to say we are entirely happy with the formulation of those sentencing principles in that clause, but certainly the appearance of such an attempt to codify, to describe, the appropriate sentencing approach is very much to be welcomed.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the weaknesses of the Bill, were it not for the time constraints we are operating under it might have been appropriate to devote some considerable time in the Commitee stage of this Bill to spelling out some of them and, indeed, to moving amendments to endeavour to deal with them. But for the moment let me indicate what some of them appear to the Opposition to be. I will describe the context in which I believe it is appropriate for these weaknesses to be sought to be remedied in a moment. One weakness is, as the Opposition spokesman on defence, Mr Scholes, described in his contribution to the debate on this Bill in the House of Representatives on 17 August, that it does not seem to provide clear or adequate cover to Service personnel when they are engaged in assisting the civil power. There are all sorts of uncertainties about the powers, duties and protections of Service personnel in those situations and this Bill does not do anything really to resolve them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second concern relates to clause 10 of the Bill insofar as it refers to the presevation of the principles of the common law with respect to criminal liability. That is a clause of very considerable vagueness and ambiguity, it not being at all clear whether what are there being referred to are the substantive common law criminal offences or merely rather the common law rules relating to the determination and establishment of guilt. It may well be only the latter but there is, nonetheless, a degree of uncertainty which is an unhappy uncertainty in what does purport to be a fairly complete, in itself, military code.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a further matter for concern which has been the subject of representations to a number of honourable senators: The absence of protections in relation to certain kinds of behaviour being the subject of disciplinary penalties. I am referring in particular to homosexual behaviour by armed service personnel. That behaviour is not explicitly made the subject of disciplinary process in the explicit test text of this legislation, but it would be covered by clause 61 of the Bill to the extent that that clause makes a military offence anything which constitutes an offence under Australian Capital Territory law for the time being. Since most forms of homosexual activity are in fact, unfortunately, still proscribed by the Australian Capital Territory criminal law , this then is the vehicle through which homosexual behaviour can be the subject of military discipline. This assumes some importance, particularly in the context of what I understand to be the policy being applied within the armed Services, not merely of treating such behaviour when detected as grounds for military discipline but going further than that to treating such behaviour as being grounds for, in fact, expulsion from the armed Services. This is not an especially enlightened view of the world in this day and age. This subject is one which we believe could have been more sensibly and directly addressed in this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a further weakness of the Bill which we perceive in clause 75 insofar as it allows for the determination of various forms of conviction and for a variation in the sentences which can attach to such convictions. But the clause does not allow for the discharge of a person without a conviction in fact being recorded. It is, of course, the case in most jurisdictions under criminal law that people can get away with a first offence or an offence for which there is some ground for leniency. In fact, the offence does not appear on their record. We believe it is appropriate that there be some discretionary power of that kind in relation to these sorts of offences.
       </para>
       <para>
        We see in clause 137 of the Bill some untoward limitations on the extent to which persons accused of offences under military law can get external legal representation of their own choice. Again I refer to the eleventh report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which identified a large number of specific matters which troubled that Committee as possibly encroaching to an untoward extent on the liberty of the subject in the context of powers of entry to arrest, powers of detention before trial, powers of arrest, provisions relating to closed courts and so on. The basic question running through all those issues is a question about which reasonable men can differ and relates to the extent to which ordinary civil liberties can be reasonably encroached upon in the special context of discipline in a disciplined service such as the Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mention those matters which could, as I say, be the subject of debate or, indeed, amendment at the Committee stage not in order to attempt to foreshadow any such exercise in the Committee stage but simply to indicicate that there are many matters of detail which are not, on the face of it, totally satisfactory and which could well properly be the subject of review. It is not, however, the Opposition's desire-particularly since the House of Representatives has now adjourned for this year and particularly given the long and unhappy history of the legislation in terms of getting it through the Parliament-to seek in any way to delay the passage of this legislation in its present form. We believe the merits of the Bill far outweigh the specific demerits that I have identified and perhaps some others as well. What that listing of demerits and weaknesses leads me and the Opposition to suggest is that there is, in fact, a strong case to be made for the review of this legislation within a reasonable period. It is with that thought in mind that in respect of the Defence Force Discipline Bill 1982 I now move:
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end of motion add:
       </para>
       <para>
        ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Minister should, as soon as practicable after the expiration of 3 years after the proclaimed date, establish a Board, to be known as the Defence Force Discipline Legislation Board of Review consisting of such persons as he determines, which Board shall, within 12 months after it is established, prepare and furnish to the Minister a report relating to-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) the operation of this Act and the regulations; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth or of the Australian Capital Territory in so far as that law relates to the discipline of the Defence Force'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That proposal, I believe, is a responsible one and a necessary one. The very genesis of the Defence Force Discipline Bill shows how important such a review process is and how necessary it is likely to be if appropriate changes to keep pace with identified weaknesses are, in fact, to be made. Three years would appear to be about the minimum period necessary for a proper evaluation to be made of this legislation in practice. I regret to advise the Senate that the former Minister for Defence, Sir James Killen, in the House of Representatives on 18 August, responded to this proposal in a way which demonstrated amply why he is now so universally described as the Minister for Nothing. We had from him a classic mixture of bluster, bonhomie and non-sequitur, characteristics which have become the trade marks of that gentleman and evince a total failure by him to grasp the thrust and merit of this proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true, as the Minister said, that flaws may appear in this legislation in the early days of its operation. It is possible, although I believe unlikely given its record, that the government of the day will attend to those flaws. What is and should be evident is that the question of a thorough-going, comprehensive review of the operation of this legislation at the end of three years is an altogether different matter from giving piecemeal attention to particular flaws that may arise, and is perfectly consistent with and complementary to any short term tinkering that may be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I conclude by saying that this is important legislation. It is overdue legislation. It is legislation that ought to be supported by the Senate and will be supported by the Australian Labor Party. But it is not legislation without flaws and it is not the kind of legislation that ought to be put on the statute books and forgotten about for another 36 years. It is the kind of legislation that should be subject to a proper review process and the formula by which we suggest that should take place is contained in our second reading amendment, which I commend to the chamber.

         â€”I support the Bills, which I believe are a long overdue consolidation and clarification of the disciplinary legal situation in the Services. I do not think that we should, in Services which are very traditional, accept this without examining what the present situation is and what is wrong with what is going on at present. We must realise that our forces are in a high state of discipline. We have no serious legal problems and before we make a change we must be quite clear as to what is wrong with the present situation. The present situation is basically confused-though it can be made to work-but more importantly it is not really Australian at all. The existing legislation for the discipline of the Defence Force consists of three British Acts, two of which have ceased to operate in their country of origin, four sets of British rules or regulations, all of which have ceased to operate in Britain; three Australian Acts; and nine sets of regulations under our Acts.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To make the situation even more confusing, the British Acts and regulations do not apply in their original form but have been modified, added to and adjusted by Australian regulations. To put it mildly, this is a very confused situation. A few examples have been given. Senator Evans gave a couple and I will give a couple more. In the case of the Navy and the Air Force some provisions of the United Kingdom legislation apply in parallel with corresponding, but not identical, Australian legislation. Sometimes one prevails and sometimes the other. The basic law for the Navy is contained in a modern United Kingdom statute, the Naval Discipline Act of 1957, whereas Army and Air Force law is based on a superseded British Army Act of 1881. Senator Evans gave a few examples of the absurdities of that particular Act. It refers to such offences as duelling, behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman, beating the drums negligently occasioning false alarms on the march and conniving at the exaction of any exorbitant price for a house or store let to a sutler.

To go on to relate the absurdities, the Army is provided with two sets of disciplinary laws, one of which applies when members are serving Australia in peacetime and the other when members are serving outside Australia on war service. Their legal system changes when they go overseas.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A further example is that Army and Air Force tribunals apply the English rules of evidence but Navy tribunals apply the rules of evidence that are applicable to the Australian Capital Territory. The final example of the difficulties under which we are labouring at the moment is this reliance on British Acts. If they are changed without being noticed in Australia it might render nugatory a trial in Australia. I will give one example of that. There was a case where a naval conviction was quashed because the judge advocate advised the court-martial on the basis of an English decision which had not been followed by the High Court of Australia and he was not aware of that. We had a very clumsy and essentially unworkable situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt at all in my view that a new single Act for our Defence Force is necessary to clear up these confusions and ambiguities, to codify the disciplinary law as it applies to the Defence Force. This is necessary not only for practical reasons but also as befits our dignity as a nation. It is not proper that our Defence Force should be reliant on the laws and procedures of other parliaments. It is up to this Parliament to provide the disciplinary laws for its own Defence Force.

        It has already been pointed out that the present Bill has been many years in gestation. It has been a difficult process. An earlier Bill which was produced-I saw it a decade or so ago-would have been very unsatisfactory. As it was produced then it was a lawyer's dream, but it was a service officer's nightmare and it would have been unworkable in practice. What we have to think about is why we need a Defence Force Discipline Bill at all. Why can we not use the ordinary civil laws? I think that everyone knows the answer. When a man enlists he renounces for necessary reasons some rights he had as a civilian. If he does that it is particularly important that we see that he is fairly treated-treated justly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The different requirements the Services have, because they are disciplined fighting forces, are quite unlike what is required in ordinary civil administration. Offences must be promptly dealt with. We cannot afford to have a situation in which offences linger on for months. Although there must be proper respect for the rights of the individual, it is at least equally important that there should be certainty of punishment for the guilty because nothing is more damaging to morale and therefore the efficiency of the unit concerned, than if a clearly guilty person gets off, particularly if he gets off on a legal technicality. The code must be simple and clear and there must be certainty of punishment for those who have committed offences. But above all-this is the most difficult one-we must avoid excessive delays. As I have said we must avoid perversions of true justice by excessive legalisms.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not always achieved. The matter of producing a new code does not solve all our problems. I mentioned that the earlier version of this code was highly unsatisfactory. After the Second World War the Americans produced a uniform code of military justice for their forces. It was a catastrophe; it was a legal bonanza but it did immense harm for the discipline and efficiency of the American services. It was not a practical way to run the discipline of a fighting service. What we must do as I have pointed out, is balance the problems . We must protect the rights of the individual. We must always have in mind that the purpose of a Defence Force Discipline Bill is to see that the Defence Force is efficient for its primary role. I believe that the present Bill is a fair and workable compromise. There must always be compromise in a Bill such as this. It creates a workable system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also support the amendment which has been moved by Senator Evans. One of the great worries in dealing with this Defence Force Discipline Bill has been the inordinate delays in getting it before the Parliament. It will not be a perfect Bill. There will certainly be some difficulties which will emerge through experience. We must see that such amending Bills are promptly enacted by this Parliament. Therefore, we must have a structure which will enable us to bring forward the necessary amendments. If we just left it to the Department of Defence and the Attorney-General's Department I fear, from past experience, that years might pass before such amending legislation would come forward. By setting up a review committee after three years I hope and trust that the legislation will be promptly implemented. These Bills will make a substantial contribution to codifying the disciplinary code of our Defence Force. They will do it in a way which will preserve the efficiency of our Defence Force and provide justice for the individuals in it.

         â€”I would be a brave person if I were to attempt to analyse or criticise extensively the Defence Force Discipline Bill which, as far as I can see, has been the subject of a series of intense consultations by expert people for no less a time than 18 years, going back to a working party which I believe was set up in 1965. The report of that working party having been presented, the legislation has been in gestation for the past eight years. It is very complex and constructive legislation. Previous speakers have mentioned some of the strange provisions, such as those concerning duelling and beating drums and things of that kind, which will be eliminated. I do not know whether it has been mentioned but, most importantly, the death penalty will be abolished. These measures are an enlightened move into the twentieth century for the Defence Force disciplinary code.

        Altogether, this legislation should be applauded. It is something which all parties here should, and do, support. The Australian Democrats support it without significant amendment. However, we do support Senator Evans's amendment. This has been a difficult matter and it has taken a long time for people to get what they think is the best possible result. It is unlikely to turn out to be a perfect result. For that reason alone it is very wise to provide for some sort of legislative board of review which can look at it after it has been operating, as Senator Evans's amendment suggests, for 12 months and then report to the Minister for Defence.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I wish to raise a matter of great concern about a constituent in Tasmania called Geoff Lucas of Risdon Vale, a Hobart suburb. Mr Lucas was one of five passengers on an Aero Commander plane, VH-EXQ, which crashed into Frederick Henry Bay near Hobart Airport on 27 April 1981. The summary report from the investigation of that accident was available only last month. The pilot was engaged in ferrying passengers across Bass Strait while commercial airlines were not flying due to an industrial dispute. The operation was apparently illegal, or at least regulations were not complied with, as I shall show in a moment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Mr Lucas suffered a heart attack while he was in the water awaiting rescue. He suffered severe hypothermia and nearly died as a result of the accident. He is still suffering today and has been invalided out of his job. He has received no compensation whatsoever for his loss of earnings, for his medical expenses, both then and continuing, or for his pain and suffering. The insurance company involved, the insurance company of the company Tasair, has refused to pay, although it has paid for the loss of the aeroplane. It has apparently not paid for the personal injury because it argues that the pilot's licence was not in order. Yet I should like to point out that it was no fault of the injured passenger that regulations were broken. As far as I am aware, all the passengers on the flight thought that it was either a proper private charter or even a proper regular passenger transport arrangement. They did pay individual fares and the aircraft did leave from Trans Australia Airlines' Tullamarine Airport terminal. It was not even the case that it left from Essendon Airport. It was, to all appearances, a proper commercial flight.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been many allegations about the flight and the accident-for instance , that there was only one life jacket on board; that the pilot had been drinking in Melbourne, and even during the flight; that he was not qualified for instrument flight rules involved in what turned out to be a night landing or at least an after sunset landing; that there had been no proper safety explanation before take-off and that there was no warning about what emergency action was appropriate as the inevitable impact with the sea approached. So in the light of those sorts of allegations, I believe that Mr Lucas has been very badly treated and has been getting the run-around. I think that he could be forgiven for thinking that there was a giant conspiracy involved in this matter, especially when one considers the connection between the involved parties. I do not intend to mention names tonight, but I shall certainly do so if no action eventuates which provides Mr Lucas with compensation. For instance, the lawyer for the insurance company also represented Tasair at the prosecution of the pilot and of the company in the Hobart Magistrate's Court. That lawyer is also a pilot member of the aero club which has its association with and is a major shareholder of Tasair.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        So there are a number of questions to which I would like answers from the Minister. Obviously they are not questions which can be answered in detail tonight, but I think that the matter is important enough for me to raise them and to demand answers. For instance, is the insurance company within its rights to refuse to honour the insurance contract, or is it obliged to pay up under the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act? How come the company has paid for the aeroplane's loss, despite the illegality of the flight, yet not for the personal injury involved? If it is not obliged to pay up, why not? How can it avoid the terms of the Act? In passing I mention that advice has been given that payment is usually made only on death, not injury. Again, I should like the Minister to confirm whether that advice is right or wrong. I do not believe it is any answer to say 'Well, if the insurance company does not pay up, the carrier must pay'. Who is to say that the carrier has enough assets to pay the full and appropriate compensation? Incidentally, Mr Lucas has taken steps to sue the company, the aero club and the pilot.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to know what mechanism can be instituted to ensure that passengers are not hoodwinked into believing that all is well in such a flight and that only properly licensed pilots fly for reward, especially from a normal commercial terminal, regardless of whether there is an industrial dispute at the time. I would like to know how it was that the Hobart and Melbourne towers allowed the flights to depart. Is there no way of checking the identification and licence of pilots in such circumstances?
       </para>
       <para>
        There are some other minor questions to which I would like to obtain answers. For instance, why does the accident summary report from the then Department of Transport and the now Department of Aviation say that there was nil injury to all of the listed passengers when, plainly, that was no so? Why was the pilot granted a student pilot licence immediately after the crash so that he could keep flying, especially as very serious charges were to be laid against him, charges which led to his being sentenced to gaol, although the sentence was varied on appeal? There is a great absence of full knowledge of the circumstances and many of the allegations because of the pilot's pleading guilty at the prosecution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to know why the investigation was stopped. Was the reason simply the razor gang limitations on funds, or was it some other reason? I would also like to know the answer to the allegations that the records of interview by the Australian Federal Police were not passed on to the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office which was responsible for the prosecution. To me the main problem is the lack of control over people wanting to make a fast buck at the expense of and risk to people who are open to exploitation; that is, people who are in a hurry to fly for all sorts of good reasons during a dispute affecting the airlines. We have a cosy club of people who are, apparently, all wanting to protect each other by a veil of silence and non-co-operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want Mr Lucas to be properly compensated for all his dreadful suffering. I want better protection in the future for charter passengers such as he in relation to safety to ensure that such passengers arrive and compensation being in order if they do not. I believe there needs to be a much fuller and more open inquiry into this case than there has been so far. If the answers are not satisfactory in the next couple of months I intend to take the matter further when Parliament resumes. Perhaps this is just an isolated case. Perhaps it is just one example of shady operations in the general aviation industry, and I am worried that it may be the latter.

         â€”Tonight I desire to raise a matter which I have raised before in questions asked in this Parliament. It is a matter which has been the cause of some months of correspondence between the New South Wales Government and me. It concerns an Australian citizen who, I believe, is suffering considerable injustice because of the failure of the officers of the New South Wales Government in particular, including police officers, to make available to him the evidence required for him in connection with an appeal which is to take place in Thailand. The man in question is William Charles Sinclair who was convicted, after he was in a Thai gaol for some years, and who was tried on charges in Thailand for having possession of and attempting to export narcotics. He was charged along with two other persons-Warren Fellows and Paul Cecil Hayward-who have been convicted and who have not appealed. I do not think there is any question of their involvement in the attempt to remove these narcotics from Thailand.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        William Charles Sinclair has reiterated and confirmed a contention in a book published yesterday, called Kingdom of Illusions: The William Sinclair Story, by Richard Shears and Isabelle Gidley. It relates the result of further proceedings in Thailand in the last three years. After being in gaol for a number of years before trial Sinclair was convicted on 23 July 1981. He subsequently appealed and protested that the evidence against him was false and concocted. Ultimately he was successful in that appeal. His sentence of 33 years and eight months was quashed and on 16 April of this year his appeal was upheld. There was a further appeal to another court, which was due to be heard yesterday but because of his failure to attend court because his health at the moment is in no way such that he can attend and nor does he have available to him the evidence which he needs for that appeal, as has been reported today, he has suffered the loss of his bail money, which is very substantial, and he is under threat of arrest and extradition to Thailand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important to realise that great injustice is being done by Australian authorities to this man in his attempt to get justice from a court in Thailand. I came into this matter some time before his appeal was upheld when his son, Gregory Sinclair-who is a constituent of mine in Victoria-approached me as well as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) to make arrangements for the Australian Government to do the necessary things to enable evidence that had been given in New South Wales, which refuted allegations that had been made against Sinclair, to be certified and used in the Thai court. That was done by the Australian Government. Subsequently, after the successful appeal by Mr Sinclair, other problems developed. I have been endeavouring, quite unsuccessfully, since then to obtain satisfaction on his behalf. His appeal was upheld but he had to face another appeal. It became evident that what he needed to do was obtain evidence which would refute a statement which was alleged to have been made by him and which he has always contended was taken from him by New South Wales police officers in Thailand, accompanied by one police major Virat who is sometimes apparently known as Mad Dog Virat when he goes under that style. It is suggested that the document which they created is not genuine. The document which Sinclair says he signed was a quarto size document but now apparently it is a foolscap document. I do not know how that can be explained. He desires and needs to be able to dispute the original nature of that document. There is no doubt about his signature on it but there is a lot of doubt about the content of the document and whether the original has ever been produced. It has certainly never been tested by any forensic experts.

        As a consequence of this on 17 June this year I tried to obtain the assistance of the Commonwealth Attorney-General, Senator Durack. To save time I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard certain correspondence so that honourable senators will be able to see the course of these events. I will not read the details but I will just comment very briefly on these letters.

        Since his release on bail by the Thailand Supreme Court, I have had the opportunity of conversations with Mr William Sinclair, who has now returned to Australia.
       </para>

        He is now residing at 57 Guildford Road, Surrey Hills, Victoria, with his son Gregory and family, and is at the moment undertaking medical and dental treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you are aware, I have been concerned at the evidence which was used against Mr Sinclair through the interposition of Australian police and embassy officials , and which has subsequently been discredited in the further proceedings in the Thailand courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you are probably also aware, there are difficulties at the present time because, under the curious arrangements of Thai law, Mr Sinclair is required to be back in Thailand to hear the reading of an appeal which apparently the prosecution intends to pursue and this requires him to be present in the court on 21 June. He has forwarded to Thailand medical certificates, copies of which I enclose herewith indicating why he will not be able to appear in court on that date, and it is trusted that he will be able to pursue his appeal thereafter despite the fact that it appears that the bail of 1 million baht (or $41,000) will be automatically forfeited.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also hoped that when it is ascertained that further evidence that was used against him, is false and defective in many respects, something will be done about this matter, but in the meanwhile I am asked that you exercise your good offices to request the Thai authorities to avoid the forfeiture of bail, if he does not appear for the reading of the appeal.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of important matters Mr Sinclair has raised with me and also through his solicitors, and in respect to which your urgent intervention is requested.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you are aware, Detective Sgt. B. W. Dunn of the New South Wales Police Force (Criminal Intelligence Unit), and Detective Sgt. McAfee produced an alleged document from William Sinclair in the criminal proceedings in Thailand being the alleged statement he made to them on 22nd December, 1978 in the Maha-Chai Prison in Thailand. There appears to be grave doubts as to whether the photostat document actually produced in the court was indeed any such statement made by Mr Sinclair, and the court proceedings were in fact adjourned so that the photostat copy which had been produced in the court could be replaced by the original. On the resumption of the hearing I am informed that a document was produced (which was alleged to be the original but which is not so), and in fact that original document has never been produced in any court or to the Woodward Commission to the best of my knowledge.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Sinclair therefore as an Australian citizen requests your assistance in the following respects:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. To urgently approach the New South Wales Government to arrange for Detective Sgt. Dunn and Detective Sgt. McAfee to produce the original of this alleged statement so that it may be examined for authenticity by competent forensic experts.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Upon production of this original, for you to forward it to the Thailand Supreme Court so that Mr Sinclair will have the same basic legal rights as he would have in Australia of facing and refuting such an original document in the appeal proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. That the Australian Government investigate and verify that the document now held in the Thailand Supreme Court is only a photostat and not an original document.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. To obtain from Detective Sgt. Dunn an explanation of why the original document was not left in Thailand in view of the gravity of the charges presented against Mr Sinclair.
       </para>
       <para>
        5. To produce and provide the necessary evidence to show that these two State policemen had the appropriate authority and relevant clearances from the Commonwealth Government to operate as police in a foreign country, namely Thailand.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. To give an assurance that the Australian Government will again intercede with the Thai Supreme Court and again attest to the validity of the subsequent New South Wales court findings, as this is a hearing in a completely separate court to the original Appeals Court, and it may be necessary to validate the documents further to ensure that the Supreme Court has all the evidence before it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because the obtaining of this material may take some time, I would ask specifically that the Australian Government should approach the Thai authorities to ensure there is a delay of any hearing on the 21st June, which might otherwise lead to the forfeiture of the enormous bail imposed upon this man, particularly, bearing in mind that his appeal has been upheld by the Appeal Court and that he should be enabled to continue with his appeal without being required to attend, not only at great expense but also at the expense of his health at the present time.

        Dear Senator Missen,
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to your letter dated 17 June 1982 in which you asked the Government to act in a number of respects on behalf of Mr William Sinclair.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the first place your asked that the Government approach the Thai authorities to ensure that bail money paid by Mr Sinclair not be forfeited if he failed to appear on 21 June 1982 before the courts in Thailand. You asked specifically that the Government request that the Thai courts delay the hearing scheduled for 21 June 1982. This is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, I am advised that it would not be appropriate for the Government to attempt to intervene in such a case. I understand however that Mr Sinclair's lawyer appeared on his behalf on 21 June 1982 and that bail has not been forfeited.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, you refer to a document allegedly held by the New South Wales police and to certain alleged conduct of a New South Wales police officer. Mr Sinclair should approach the New South Wales Government regarding these matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, you mention that Mr Sinclair requests evidence that two officers of the New South Wales police had Commonwealth authority to operate in Thailand. I am not aware that any Commonwealth authority was given or that any such authority is required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, you request on Mr Sinclair's behalf an assurance that the Australian Government will again intercede with the Thai Supreme Court and attest to the validity of a record of certain proceedings before a New South Wales court. I understand that if this is required by the Thai authorities, and the New South Wales court authorities can provide an authenticated record of the proceedings, the Department of Foreign Affairs is willing to assist by transmitting the record to the Thai authorities in an appropriate form.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am informed that information provided to the Australian Embassy in Bangkok by Mr Sinclair's lawyers concerning the proceedings is being passed on to Mr Sinclair by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra as it arrives.
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of the fact that the matters you raise on behalf of Mr Sinclair are not within my area of responsibility, I would be grateful if you would communicate with the responsible Minister and/or Government should your wish to pursue these matters further.

         â€”With that letter I sent him also a copy of the letter that I had written to the Attorney-General and a copy of the Attorney-General's reply. I sought to ascertain whether the New South Wales Government would make available the original document, which it is contended is not a genuine document, so that it could be inspected by forensic experts and could then be returned, as it should be, to the Thailand Supreme Court and used in the appeal which my constituent was then to undergo. I also sought authentication of documents in New South Wales because in a case in the New South Wales court the original informer-the man who originally gave evidence against Sinclair-in subsequent court proceedings against Sinclair's son and others on conspiracy charges admitted that he had made these statements merely to satisfy the police, and that they were not true. That request was made to the Hon. Neville Wran on 30 June. Never has any satisfaction come from that request despite much more correspondence since. That letter was acknowledged by the Premier's Department on 5 July. I was told by the Premier's secretary:

        Then, on 10 August, on a television program entitled The Reporters on Channel 10 in New South Wales, the New South Wales Minister for Police, Mr Peter Anderson, displayed the original document which he said was the original document that Sinclair had signed. It was shown to the interviewer but, of course, it was not available for inspection by Sinclair's lawyers or put to any study. As a result of that program-I have heard the tape of the program although I did not see it myself-on 17 August 1982 in this chamber, I asked a question of the Attorney-General in which I again sought his good offices to try to aid the production of this information. The Attorney-General was surprised that I had not been able to get anywhere with the New South Wales Government. He said:

        I want to emphasize that I am particularly concerned that the original document , which is alleged to have been signed by Mr. William Sinclair, be made available for inspection by him and his legal and forensic experts. This document was, according to evidence given in the Thai court, made available to that court after the case was adjourned to enable this to be done but, of course , it now appears from the disclosure made by your Minister of Police on a recent television programme, that the original is still in the possession of the Minister. Apparently, what is in the Thai court is, again, another photostat.

        It is, of course, desired that the authenticity of this original document be tested and that subsequently it be made available to the Thai court, so that the interests of this Australian citizen in a foreign court can be preserved and properly tested.

        In addition, the Minister of Justice has advised that he has been unable to identify any proceedings now before any New South Wales Court involving findings concerning Mr Sinclair, or admitted evidence provided by him.

We were informed by Mr Stewart that the original document which should, of course, have been in the Thai court and which apparently has never been in the Thai court, had been returned to the police by the presiding judge and returned to Australia . He also complained that he could not identify the proceedings which I was talking about. I had always been talking about proceedings in Thailand. He seemed to be somewhat confused. He could not identify any New South Wales court proceedings in which the document might be required. An extraordinary piece of obfuscation took place at that stage.

        Re: Mr William Sinclair Having now returned to Australia I have had the opportunity of considering your reply dated 7 September 1982 (under the hand of Hon. Kevin Stewart, M.P.) relating to the representations made by me in my letters to you of the 30 June and 23 August 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        The representations concern the documents which are held by the New South Wales police relating to the charges against Mr William Sinclair, that are still pending on appeal in Thailand. The references in your reply to proceedings now before courts in New South Wales or to Royal Commissions are confusing-I have never suggested there is any current litigation save the pending appeal in Thailand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am most concerned about the apparent confusion which exists as to why the original document is required. I point out that, ''the original document is required first for for forensic study and then for return to Thailand in connection with the appeal in Thailand'' (not any litigation in New South Wales) .
       </para>
       <para>
        I said in my earlier correspondence with you on this matter, ''it is desired that the authenticity of this original document be tested and that it be made available to the Thai court, so that the interests of this Australian citizen in a foreign court can be preserved and properly tested''. In the light of additional information, this becomes of even greater relevance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note the statement by the New South Wales Minister for Police and Emergency Services that the original statement was produced to the Thai Court and subsequently released by that court to Detective Sergeant Dunn and returned to Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I enclose a photostat of a statutory declaration by Chai Suawansri (Mr William Sinclair's trial attorney in Thailand) dated 11 October 1982, (the original of which can be produced) which confirms that there is ''no evidence in the record of the Criminal Court that the court was ever shown or received the original of said purported document''.
       </para>

He is indignant that he now finds that he was the unknowing medium for delivering the letter not to the Thai Supreme Court but to the man against whom the allegations are made.

        I believe that it is important to put these matters on the record. Mr Sinclair is an Australian citizen. He is a man who I think has had a somewhat difficult past. Some authorities may think that he is a man who has not shown a great deal of credibility in the past. They might have even hoped that he would stay in gaol in Thailand and not come back to Australia. This man has rights. At all stages he has protested his innocence. In fact, the courts in Thailand have found that he is not guilty, that he is not part of the charges which have been raised. As the position stands at the moment, his bail is now forfeited. There is a warrant for his arrest. This country may be asked to extradite him. I believe that this is a shocking record, and an indictment of the Government and the authorities of the State of New South Wales, of the police and of the higher officials who have sought, in the last six months, to avoid allowing evidence to be obtained and given. I hope that both the Attorney-General and the Commonwealth Government will feel it necessary now to intervene or at least bring their good offices to bear to ensure that some justice is done in this case. I hope that the people of Australia will be able to appreciate that injustice is being done to a citizen of this country.

         â€”I take this opportunity briefly to raise a matter in connection with the Royal Australian Air Force base at Learmonth and the proposed base at Derby, both in the north-west of Western Australia. The base at Learmonth has been operational for several years now and, as the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) recently pointed out, has been the subject of recent capital works to improve the airfield's capacity for handling aircraft deployments. That work includes extensions to some of the parking aprons, improvement to flight line facilties and upgrading of the fuel storage capacity on the base. I understand that the base now has a fuel storage capacity of some two million litres in semi-buried tanks supplied by road from Port Hedland, some 919 kilometres to the north. I suggest that that is a quite large quantity of fuel and a very considerable distance over which it must be transported.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also point out to the Senate that as the main Air Force installation in Western Australia north of the 26th parallel-indeed, the only installation between Pearce just north of Perth and Darwin in the Northern Territory-it would be extremely important in the event that Australia became involved in some sort of threat or perceived threat. Yet, as I said, Learmonth receives its fuel from Port Hedland by road transport. It is almost the same distance as from Canberra to Brisbane. In the event of hostilities that supply line would be extremely vulnerable. The single road link between the two towns would be a logical primary target, and a successful strike on that road would leave the north-west of Western Australia devoid of air cover except for that which could be provided by using the fuel already on the base. It is a matter about which, in my view, we should all be concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Government for its initiative so far in increasing the air defence of the north-west of Western Australia by constructing a new air base in the region. Construction of the new $50m project near Derby is expected to commence next year. It will provide the next step in what the Minister recently described as the 'umbrella of forward operating facilities' in the north and north-west of Western Australia which will eventually include the construction of a patrol boat base at Finucane Island off Port Hedland. As I said, I commend the Government for this initiative which will greatly assist in coastal surveillance as well as provide the infrastructure to deal with an attack on this vulnerable portion of the nation's vital coastline. However, it would seem that the same problem has arisen with respect to the new facility at Derby as arose at Learmonth. It is no secret that the harbour at Derby is very shallow and has siltation problems. Recently the State ship Pilbara ran aground at Derby , prompting an investigation of the harbour facilities which concluded that expensive dredging would be necessary to maintain the harbour. Given the small trade through the port, such expenses were deemed not to be necessary. The State ship Pilbara which ran aground at Derby was a vessel of 13,000 tonnes. The average tanker engaged in the Australian coastal trade, the BP Enterprise type, is a vessel of about 26,000 tonnes. There is clearly no prospect that vessels of that size could use Derby and, therefore, no prospect that the airfield at Derby could be supplied with fuel in that way.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two alternatives, as I see it. Firstly, coastal tankers of the BP Enterprise type could supply the base through the deep-water port at Broome, though that would once again necessitate a vulnerable road section. In this case the fuel would have to be transported about 220 kilometres from Derby to Broome, once again a costly exercise on what in a time of hostilities would be a very fragile link indeed. The alternative is to use the shallow draft Chinese tankers of about 3,000 tonnes which can use the port of Derby. I simply say to honourable senators that the experience of the company which operates through Derby in that way has not been encouraging. Indeed, I am advised that the company is looking at long term alternatives at present. Given that fact, I would not have thought it a viable proposition for the Royal Australian Air Force to consider supplying fuel to its new base at Derby in that way. As I said , that once again leaves road transport. In fact both RAAF bases in the north- west of Western Australia will be dependent for their fuel on single road links. I say single road links because in the north of Western Australia there is rarely an alternative route.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that in the case of the Derby base, which is not yet built, such a simple thing has not been overlooked by defence planners. If it has not, I would be pleased if the Minister could explain to the Senate how this problem can be overcome. At Learmonth, on the other hand, the existing base has a very real problem. Fuel is rarely taken by road from a port almost 1,000 kilometres away. Therefore, I urge the Government to consider sea-fed storage faclities being developed at the United States Navy base at Exmouth which would have the capacity to take the coastal tankers operating along our coast. From there it would involve a road journey of only 22 kilometres or, if it were thought to be warranted, a buried pipline could be installed from Exmouth to Learmonth. This would guarantee the security of supply of fuel to Learmonth which I believe could be very important if Australia were ever to be involved in hostilities along our western coastline. Even if we are not involved in such conflicts, the advantages of a sea-fed fuel supply to Learmonth are obvious. There are economic advantages-cost savings brought about by bulk transportation of fuel in tankers rather than in several trucks run and maintained by supplying oil companies at the expense of the RAAF. Certainly there is nothing in road transport for the oil companies. Their costs are defrayed by the Government through simply being able to build the extra cost into the cost of the fuel. However, I understand that they too would welcome this initiative because of the greater convenience it would afford them in this trade. The Royal Australian Air Force should also presumably welcome it for the eventual cost savings, the undoubted convenience, greater surety of supply and, above all, for the obvious advantage that supplies would not be so easily placed in jeopardy in a crisis. In conclusion, I therefore seek a response from the Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) on the viability of a sea-fed fuel supply line at Learmonth and a clarification of the position at the proposed base at Derby.

      <para>
       In New South Wales no recent surveys have been undertaken but Aboriginal children in most parts of the State are regularly screened for hearing defects.
      </para>

       In Victoria Aboriginal adults attending the Aboriginal Health Service, Fitzroy have been surveyed. Aboriginal children in the country regions of Warrnambool, Swan Hill and Shepparton have also been surveyed.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Queensland a Hearing Conservation and Treatment Program for ear diseases in the State's Aboriginals has been conducted since 1974. In 1981, 17 rural communities were surveyed and during 1982 up to and including May, 14 have been assessed.
      </para>
      <para>
       In South Australia surveys have been undertaken since 1970 in remote communities and in the north-west of the State, in 1974 and 1980 and yearly since then.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Western Australia fifteen surveys have been mounted during the last two years to estimate the extent of hearing problems and ear disease in Aboriginal children aged 0-12 years. The principal areas surveyed are Eastern Goldfields, Murchison, Pilbara and Kimberley.

       In Tasmania no recent surveys have been undertaken.

       In the Australian Capital Territory the main Aboriginal population is located in the Wreck Bay area of the Jervis Bay territory. No surveys of hearing defects are undertaken but routine examination of toddlers, pre-school and primary children are carried out. Secondary school children attend N.S.W. High Schools and are screened in that State's school program.

       (2) and (3) New South Wales. Accurate estimates of the number of Aboriginals in the State having hearing defects cannot be made. Limited information would be available for some communities but it would not be possible to extrapolate such information for the State. No accurate estimates are available on the prevalence of hearing problems in either urban or metropolitan areas.

      <para>
       Victoria. The Fitzroy (metropolitan) survey revealed that more than 50% of Aboriginal adults have a significant hearing loss. In country regions, the Warrnambool survey indicated that 33% of Aboriginal children suffer a significant hearing loss. The Swan Hill survey disclosed a figure of 25% and the Shepparton survey 36%. Based on these figures it could be estimated that 30-35% of Aboriginal people in Victoria have a significant hearing problem but it is not possible to separate rural and metropolitan populations.

       Queensland. The Hearing Conservation and Treatment Program referred to in (1) aims to identify ear disease and hearing loss in Aboriginal communities, to provide and evaluate treatment and to improve rural health by increasing awareness of ear disease and hearing loss. It is conducted by the Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland with Commonwealth funds. In 1981 and 1982 the prevalence of hearing loss was as follows:

       South Australia: The main emphasis on the surveys referred to in (1) has been on detecting the cause of defects viz middle ear infection. A 1971 survey in the Yalata region disclosed that 23% of children examined required treatment for hearing loss. In the remote north-west a survey in 1974 showed 42% of Aboriginal people evidenced ear drum perforation and some hearing loss. In a 1980 survey the incidence of perforation was 21%. A generalist in 1976 and a specialist in 1977 reported a lower incidence of middle ear disease than was found in the 1974 survey. In 1978, almost 350 children under 15 years of age in remote communities , were examined and 27% showed perforation and received specialist treatment. In 1980 about 80% of Aboriginals had no significant hearing defects and it was also estimated that less than 1% would suffer from serious defects. No figures are available to estimate the hearing problems of Aboriginal people in other rural or the metropolitan areas.

      <para>
       Western Australia: Of 1 054 Aboriginal children from the initial surveys, 69% were found to have normal hearing and 31% had a hearing loss in one or both ears . 21% had a mild loss, 9% had a moderate loss and 1% had a severe loss.
      </para>
      <para>
       No surveys have been carried out on adults. It is estimated that in adult Aboriginals 10% would suffer hearing loss.

       Northern Territory: The 1981 survey showed that 38.6% of Aboriginal children had some degree of hearing impairment in one or both ears. No true comparison between urban and rural Aboriginal hearing defects can be made because urban surveys do not distinguish between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. However a survey of all school children in Darwin in 1981 indicated that 12.5% suffered some degree of hearing impairment. No data are available on Aboriginal adults.

       Australian Capital Territory: The routine examinations of young children referred to in (1) have revealed 11% suffering hearing defects, none of which were severe. No data are available on Aboriginal adults.

      <para>
       During a time of threat to Australia it cannot be discounted that there could be a requirement for the airstrips (and a wide range of other civil resources) to be used by the Australian Defence Force in the defence of Australia. Whether there would be a need for these particular airstrips to be utilised and the nature of defence use, if any, would depend very much upon the circumstances at the time. Exercises for the Australian Defence Force in northern Australia are not restricted only to the use of Commonwealth-owned facilities and some defence use may occur in the future in this context, although none is specifically planned at this stage. There is no threat of military hostilities against northern Australia in the foreseeable future.
      </para>
      <para>
       If hostilities were to occur these five airstrips along with a wide range of other civil facilities in the north could be potential targets. Defence Force use of any particular facility while perhaps, but not necessarily, increasing its value as a target, also contributes substantially to its defence against attack, as well as contributing to the overall defence of Australia.

       (2) I am advised that the personal care subsidy payable by the Department of Social Security to hostel residents in receipt of approved personal care services was increased from $80 to $120 per qualified resident per 28 day period with effect from 6 July 1982. This change will give greater financial assistance to organisations providing care within hostels for active, confused elderly persons. A Working Party consisting of representatives of the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations, the Australian Council on the Ageing , and the Departments of Social Security and Health has been established to review the present basis for recurrent Commonwealth financial assistance to hostels. One of the matters being considered by the Working Party is whether additional subsidy should be paid in respect of care provided to active, confused elderly persons.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In my 1982-83 Budget Speech, I announced that the Government is to take action against certain tax evasion practices in the so-called 'cash' economy. The new measures-the deduction of tax at source in relation to selected payments for labour and services and associated arrangements for reporting by householders of payments made in connection with certain building and construction projects-are aimed at preventing evasion of tax by failure to declare income consisting of such payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's decision to introduce these measures, with effect from 1 July 1983, follows long and careful consideration of the most appropriate and effective means to counter this kind of evasion, which has grown in recent years because persons who have traditionally stood in the relationship of employer and employee are, for various reasons, entering into arrangements under which the former employee assumes the role of an independent contractor providing labour and services who is entitled to be paid without deduction of tax at source.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is also currently reviewing the adequacy of the penalty provisions of the taxation laws with a view to increasing the level of taxpayer compliance with those laws. While I cannot, at this stage, indicate the likely outcome of this review, I can say that significant deterrents to tax evasion practices, whether involving the 'cash' economy or not, are under consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) I am not aware of any particular tax avoidance or other practices that are peculiar to people in the roofing industry in New South Wales. I am, however, aware that some people engaged in the building and other industries do seek cash in hand payments for labour and services free of tax deductions, and that in many cases these people have failed to disclose this income in their tax returns.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) I had not been aware that the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union had been campaigning as advised by the honourable senator. The Union and its officials have not made any representations to me, or to the Commissioner of Taxation with whom I discussed this aspect, regarding this matter. However, if the Union is able to supply the Taxation Office with information regarding specific cases where tax evasion is suspected to have occurred, these will be fully investigated.

       (1) to (4) The Public Service Board has informed me that on 21 October 1982 the Acting Public Service Arbitrator issued a consent determination giving effect to salary increases offered to engineer or related groups by the Board on 24 September 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is the view of the Board that the salaries of engineers employed by the Australian Public Service are now broadly comparable with those of engineers in the New South Wales Public Service. Any anomalies that it is claimed existed between graduate engineers and drafting grades prior to the increases were largely the result of the different timing of pay reviews concerning those groups. The salary of a graduate engineer is now higher than the starting salary of a draftsman.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition the Public Service Board also considers that these increases should largely, if not totally, remove situations where the maximum salary of a subordinate technical officer/draftsman exceeds that of his professional supervisor. A process for dealing with any remaining situations of this nature was included in the offer that was accepted by the relevant organisations.

No specific cases have been referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Hobart for advice as to the possible prosecution of those involved in the schemes, but in one case counsel's opinion has been sought through the Crown Solicitor regarding the liquidation of a company. As to prosecution action, however, representative cases on an Australia wide basis have been the subject of advice from the Crown Solicitor and review by the Solicitor-General. In the light of this advice, a special prosecutor was recently appointed by the Government to look into pre-tax profit stripping activities designed to evade payment of company tax with a view to instituting prosecutions in the courts for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.

       (1) Yes, although precise figures on the number of these operations are not available. Based on claims under Item 6299 of the Medical Benefits Schedule-' Amputation of the Clitoris' (the only item covering operations on the clitoris), my Department estimates that there were 23 cases in 1979-80 and 12 cases in 1980 -81. These are the most recent years for which estimates are available. Age breakdown is not available and the data may be incomplete as they do not include operations for which no claims have been made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I am not aware that any of these operations are carried out for ritual rather than for medical reasons. Previous investigations by my Department revealed that most operations were carried out in cases of indeterminate sex of children due to congenital or genetic disorders.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. However, traditionally such ritual circumcision operations are carried out by tribal women in secrecy and not by doctors. Such operations would only come to notice should complications arise or during gynaecological examination in later life. Appeals for information on this matter were made in 1979-80 through the Maternal Health and Reproduction (Standing) Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. A similar appeal was published in the Australian Medical Association 'Monthly Bulletin'. While no confirmation of Australian cases was obtained from any of these sources, my Department continues to keep the matter under review.
      </para>
      <para>
       In any event, legislative control of such operations is a State responsibility and is covered by common law or the Criminal Code in each State.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Two procedures which, broadly, may be regarded as ritual operations are performed on both migrants and non-migrants. One is circumcision of male infants ; the other is ear-piercing, which is often carried out by non-medical personnel .

       It is presently expected that work on the new automatic exchange should be completed during September 1983. Concurrently at least 12 additional trunk lines will be provided to Thursday Island. A manual trunk exchange will be retained on the Island at this stage to handle subscriber traffic requiring operator assistance.
      </para>

       The next stage planned is the extension of the Cairns-Coen broadband trunk route to Bamaga/Thursday Island. This will cost about $2.5m and is programmed for completion during 1986. Sufficient trunk lines will be obtained from this installation to enable the connection of the Thursday Island exchange to the national STD grid.

       On 10 August 1982 I made public the results of part of that review, namely, the Government's decision to increase from 10 per cent per annum to 20 per cent per annum the rate of penalty tax for late payment of income tax and other taxes.

       With certain limitations, the present income tax law allows a court which imposes a pecuniary penalty to extend the time for payment or to permit payment of the fine by instalments. However, I recognise that the limitations prescribed may not, in today's society, be ragarded as entirely appropriate and that there is an absence of alternatives to imprisonment for non-payment of court-imposed taxation fines by persons who cannot pay or would experience severe hardship in paying.

      <para>
       (1) Did the following long service awards exist for members of the Army prior to 1975: (a) for Australian Regular Army Other Ranks-the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal; (b) for Army Reserve ( previously CMF) Officers-the Efficiency Decoration; (c) for Army Reserve ( previously CMF) Other Ranks-the Efficiency Medal.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Was it recognised, around 1970, that Australian Regular Army Officers were the only category not covered by a Long Service award, and was a decision taken to issue such an award.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Was progress on this decision reported regularly in the Service newspaper Army and did one report state, inter alia, 'the award when issued would carry no post-nominal initials'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Was the issue of such an award deferred, after 1972, because it was intended to replace it with an equivalent award under the new Australian system of honours.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Did the deferment of the introduction of the Australian system of honours until 14 February 1975 have the effect of rendering ineligible, through retirement, many officers with upwards of thirty years service (including war service) who otherwise could have qualified for the Imperial Long Service award had it been instituted in the early 1970's.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Does the Minister for Defence still consider, as he stated in his reply to my Question No. 1872 (Hansard, page 844, 16 March 1982) that 'Until 14 February 1975, permanent officers in the Defence Force had no expectation of receiving a Long Service Award'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Does the service given by Australian Regular Army Officers in the period 1945-1975 deserve to be recognised; if so, can steps be taken to make them eligible either for the Australian or Imperial Long Service Award.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Until 1975, there was no long service award for which officers of the Permanent Forces were eligible. During the period 1967 to 1972, the Defence Group of Departments examined the general question of awards for the recognition of long service in the Defence Force. A long service award for permanent officers, including Australian Regular Army Officers, was one of a number of options considered. No final decisions were made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) See (2) above. The option of a long service award for permanent officers was the subject of a number of letters to the Editor of the Army newspaper. In reply to one such letter, it was stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       '. . . that such an award . . . should not carry any entitlement to post- nominal initials.'
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) See (2) above. Consideration of the matter fell into abeyance in December 1972, when the Prime Minister called for a review of honours and awards practices with a view to establishing an Australian system.

       (6) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) See (5) above. While respecting the significant contribution of Australian Regular Army Officers in the period 1945-1975, there is no intention of extending eligibility for Australian long service awards to Australian Regular Army Officers who retired before 14 February 1975, the date the Australian system of honours and awards was introduced.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1), (2), (3) and (4) Early in August and September 1982 surveys of furniture in married quarters administered by HMAS Cairns were carried out by a Board of Inspectors. Items surveyed included washing machines, clothes dryers and refrigerators.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those items classified as unserviceable but of some residual value were transferred to the Department of Administrative Services for disposal by auction . Items classified as beyond economical repair were sentenced to disposal by dumping.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dumping was carried out at the Cairns Municipal Tip by the Navy establishment HMAS Cairns on two occasions, that is, after each survey. Items recorded as having been dumped were: 8 washing machines, 10 clothes dryers, 12 refrigerators , 46 mattresses (single and double), 10 lounge suites, 8 tables (of various types), 37 chairs (lounge, dining and baby), 1 cot, 4 ironing boards.
      </para>
      <para>
       Before dumping was carried out the Commanding Officer, HMAS Cairns, gave consideration to seeking approval to give the furniture to charity but did not proceed when the local Branch of the Society of St Vincent de Paul assessed the items as being of no use. Any suggestion that some of the items were in good order is therefore incorrect.
      </para>
      <para>
       Scavenging at the tip is known to be a common practice and no evidence has been found that would suggest collusion between personnel involved in the disposals and other persons who may have illegally removed material from the tip. In any event the surveys and disposals were carried out in accordance with Departmental procedures under Finance Regulations and Directions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since June 1981 replacement furniture to the value of $72,807 has been purchased for HMAS Cairns married quarters. In the same period $10,153 has been expended on furniture for new married quarters. These purchases have been made from a number of firms in Cairns.

        â€”On 18 March 1982 (Hansard, page 925) Senator Elstob asked me a question without notice concerning setting up experiments in Australia similar to those being conducted in Japan and America on sailing ships using fully computerised sails and, in conjunction with the Minister for Transport, to consider granting funds to the Australian National Line for a feasibility study on the use of computerised sailing ships. I undertook to get further information on the matter and to direct the content of the question to both NERDDC and the Minister for Transport. I am now able to provide some additional information as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the past decade there has been extensive world-wide research carried out into the application of sailing ship techniques to modern cargo vessels. In addition to the work at Monash University to which Senator Elstob has referred, work has been carried out in Australia by at least one commercial naval architect, Mr W. J. Hood. The British Ship Building Research Association conducted a symposium in London during 1980 on 'Wind Propulsion of Commercial Ships' and the proceedings of this symposium have been published. Experimental work on prototype applications has also been carried out by Japanese interests and others, and these have resulted in useful economies in certain highly specialised applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Japan a 1,600 tonne sail assisted motor tanker 'Aitoku Maru' has been constructed and is undergoing trials. Use of the sails reduces fuel consumption by about 13 per cent. This study indicates that the capital cost of wind assisted vessels would be higher than that of conventional vessels.
      </para>
      <para>
       In America current interest in sail power is directed towards the fishing industry and the merchant marine. Preliminary results in the fishing industry indicate that overall fuel savings of between 25 and 40 per cent would be possible under normal operating conditions. In regard to merchant shipping, the general consensus appears to be that sail power would be most viable for smaller vessels operating over relatively short routes. However the economics would depend on the particular application and the effects that the addition of sails would have on capital and operating costs including maintenance and manning levels.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to this work, the fuel supply problems during the 1970s also focussed attention on a number of other promising approaches to fuel economy for marine transport. These include the use of larger propellers matched to slow running engines resulting in considerable oil consumption savings and the use of improved navigational aids such as the Omega and Navstar navigation systems which allow for more accurate position-fixing than astro-navigation. Coal-fired ships are also being introduced by Australian ship owners and at least one bulk carrier is operating on CNG.
      </para>
      <para>
       In terms of commercial ship building and ship design work, Australia does not have a sufficiently large industrial base to support the substantial research effort which is traditionally carried out by the major ship building nations. However, it is clear from work to date that there is no shortage of information available to enable Australia's commercial ship owners to form appropriate judgements concerning the most economical approach to particular ship operations. In these circumstances I do not consider that it would be appropriate for special arrangements to be made to fund the Australian National Line to undertake feasibility studies in this field, particularly at a time of general restraint in Government spending. The adoption of particular technical options for carrying out its commercial activities is, of course, a matter for the judgement of ANL management.
      </para>
      <para>
       The National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) has considered two applications for support of R&amp;D into sailing ships. The two applications were not recommended for funding because it was considered that research in the area is of relatively low priority for Australia.

       The study referred to by the honourable senator was reported in the Medical Journal of Australia 1982; 2:178-183 and was entitled 'Health attitudes and knowledge, and coronary risk factors in high-school children, Sydney and Inverell'.
      </para>

       The results of this study indicated that 20 to 30 per cent of children (aged 11-16 years) surveyed were smoking cigarettes; 30 per cent were overweight or obese; 9 per cent had high blood cholesterol; and 8 to 15 per cent of boys and 2 to 7 per cent of girls had high blood pressure.
      </para>
      <para>
       To date, no national study has been carried out on the health status of a statistically representative sample of Australian children. Consequently, information is not available as regards the 'real position' of the health conditions of young people. However, within recent years a number of studies have been conducted into both the life-style patterns and health parameters of selected groups of Australian children. These studies have consistently yielded results similar to those reported in the subject article.
      </para>
      <para>
       Just as health services are mainly provided by State and Territory Governments , so too health education is primarily the responsibility of those authorities. They and various voluntary organisations are conducting a wide range of health promotion and intervention programs, many of which are directed to parents and young people. These bodies are considered the most appropriate avenues of disseminating-direct to parents, as part of the programs they conduct-the results of studies such as that reported in the subject article.

It has recently drawn up a set of dietary guidelines, published in a booklet 'Dietary Guidelines for Australians', to assist Australians to make decisions about the selection of a nutritious diet.

       My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is it a fact that no instructions or requests to prosecute under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 have been made by the Australian Taxation Office to the Crown Solicitor's Office? Did the Crown Solicitor, in evidence before Estimates Committee A yesterday, claim that he had had to phone the Taxation Office during the last few weeks concerning this matter and had received contradictory statements as to the number of cases being ready for prosecution-at one time five and at another time nine? Has there been a deliberate cover-up in the Taxation Office in order to sustain the Treasurer's oft-quoted assertion that the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act stopped the entering into of the schemes covered by that Act? If not, what is the explanation for the failure of the Taxation Office to seek prosecutions after nearly two years of operation of the Act?

      <para>
       The Treasurer has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       No prosecution proceedings have yet been instituted under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That Act came into operation on 4 December 1980 and applies to arrangements or transactions entered into on or after that date for a purpose of securing that a company (or trustee) will be unable to pay its tax. It follows that, before it can be said that a possible breach of the Act is apparent, it is necessary for preliminary investigations to have been carried out, for an assessment to have been made for the year of income in question and for the tax assessed to have remained unpaid after the due date. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that those processes have been completed in seven cases in which breaches of the Act are suspected to have occurred during the year ended 30 June 1981. On 10 September 1982 information in respect of those cases was referred to the Australian Federal Police for formal investigation. The Commissioner understands that these cases have now been referred to the Special Prosecutor (Mr R. V. Gyles, Q.C.) by the Federal Police .

      </para>
      <para>
       The study, of which Dr Beard was the principal investigator and to which the honourable senator referred, found that 4 out of 5 cases of hypertension were able to either discontinue all medication or reduce the dose, following the use of a low sodium-not a salt-free-diet. The proportion of patients who could be treated effectively solely through the use of a low sodium diet, was 1 in 3.
      </para>
      <para>
       The National Heart Foundation's Risk Factor Prevalence Study, of which I am aware, was carried out on a sample of Australian adults aged 25-64 years and living in the State capital cities. It found that approximately 20 per cent of people included in the study were hypertensive and, of this group, 33 per cent of men and 61 per cent of women were under treatment for raised blood pressure.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is the total sodium content of the diet that is related to the development of hypertension. Salt (sodium chloride) is only one of twenty sodium compounds that may be used in food manufacturing. Therefore, it is important that consumers be informed of the amount of sodium-not salt-that is contained in packaged foods, and that legislation be based on total sodium content.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matter of the declaration of sodium content on the labels of packaged foods is currently under consideration by expert committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC); these include State representation. The Council has already recommended that food ingredients, including added salt and monosodium glutamate, be declared on labels.
      </para>
      <para>
       While the content of sodium of many prepared baby foods is not specified on the label, the content of sodium in canned baby foods is so specified under legislation in the States of Victoria and Queensland. An expert committee of the NH and MRC is now preparing detailed standards, including sodium limits, for all baby foods and the major manufacturers of these foods are represented on this committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       Existing State legislation limits the sodium content of canned baby foods to 1 gram per kilogram-half the recommended limit of the Codex Alimentarius Commission of the Food and Agriculture Organization. I understand that manufacturers of baby foods are conforming nationally to this legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under these circumstances, where measures are already in place or under consideration to limit the sodium content in prepared baby foods, I do not consider there is a need for a study as proposed by the honourable senator.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the sodium content (provided mainly through added salt) of home- prepared foods and other family foods that are introduced into the diets of infants remains a problem. A recent study in Canada showed that home-prepared foods, compared to milk foods and commercial baby foods, were the major source of sodium in the diets of infants over six months of age. Nutrition education material prepared by my Department advises parents to limit the use of salty foods in the diets of young children. With increasing public awareness of the effect of salt on health, parents will hopefully become more discerning in their use of salt, particularly when preparing infants' meals.

       The article in the Institute of Public Affairs' journal was based on financial data relating to Medibank Private's operations up to 30 June 1981. The Health Insurance Commission's 1981-82 annual report was tabled in the Parliament on 27 October 1982. In the year to 30 June 1982, Medibank Private recorded surpluses totalling $16.9m in four States and losses totalling $2.4m in two States. As at 30 June 1982 Medibank Private had total reserves of $40m or $20.3m higher than at 30 June 1981. I hope that this favourable trend will continue. I see no sound basis for the suggestion that Medibank Private will need regular injections of taxpayers' funds to enable it to survive.

       The Minister for Health has provided the following answer:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's policy on reserves held by organisations registered under the National Health Act applies equally to Medibank Private. There is no legislative requirement in relation to reserves held by the organisations. Medibank Private is pursuing a policy of building up its reserves as competitive circumstances permit. Similar policies have been adopted by other funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medibank Private's accumulated losses on trading to June 1981 were as indicated in the IPA Review article referred to by the honourable senator except that the figure for New South Wales should be $6.5 million and that in Western Australia Medibank Private accumulated losses of $0.6 million in the five years to 30 June 1981. However, since the article appeared, the 1981-82 Annual Report of the Health Insurance Commission has been tabled in Parliament. This report shows that, on an overall basis, Medibank Private made a surplus of $14.5 million for the year. Losses were incurred in only two States: South Australia and Western Australia. As at 30 June 1982, total reserves stood at about $40 million, $20.3 million higher than a year earlier.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a fact that over the five years to 30 June 1981 Medibank Private's management expenses, when related to contribution income, were well in excess of the average for the industry. However, in 1981-82 Medibank Private's management expense ratios varied from 11.0 per cent to 15.0 per cent and are now much less above the industry average than they used to be.
      </para>
      <para>
       As to whether Medibank Private will charge the AMWSU the full management costs for handling its business, as mentioned in an earlier answer to a question from the honourable senator (Hansard, 26 October 1982, page 1795), Medibank Private regards the arrangements as being a purely commercial transaction and has informed me that the transaction would be profitable and in the interests of contributors.
      </para>
      <para>
       Concerning Medibank Private's superannuation liability, it is the policy of the Health Insurance Commission to meet its commitments on an emerging costs basis. These commitments are reflected in Medibank Private's management expenses.

       The collection of basic data and statistics relating to Aboriginal health is mainly a matter for the States and Territories in the first instance.

       Until such time as there is an increased flow of basic details from these sources, my Department can do little but maintain the existing level of statistics as published in the Annual Reports of the Director-General of Health . These data are prepared under the supervision of a Medical Officer Class 3 with assistance from an officer at Class 8 level. In addition, Dr L. R. Smith, B.A., Ph.D., a medical demographer who prepared the Aboriginal Health Bulletin Number 1-'Aboriginal Vital Statistics: An Analysis of Trends', has acted as a part-time consultant to my Department without renumeration.

       My Department's resources allocated to this task are to be strengthened by the imminent appointment of an experienced statistical officer.

       Each year, an amount is included in Defence Estimates under Division 235, Equipment Repair, for very limited ship repair in overseas ports. The work undertaken is to remedy urgent defects which cannot be left until the ship returns to Australia, and preventative maintenance which is declared essential by the Fleet Commander. The 1982-83 Estimates include $100,000 for overseas expenditure on these aspects, $75,000 for repair of urgent defects and $25,000 for preventative maintenance. These amounts are consistent with provision made in previous years.
      </para>
      <para>
       In May 1982, whilst Stalwart and Parramatta were in Singapore, it was necessary for operational reasons associated with the Fleet Program and the need to complete basic ship husbandry activities within that program, to perform some ship's side gritblasting and repainting. The work was performed alongside a wharf.

Until the precise form of the wage pause is agreed , however, it is not possible to calculate the further revenue loss which might be involved.

Under what conditions do associations obtain tax exempt status for donations to their funds? Has there been an application by the organisation known as Right to Life for such status?

       The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that an application was made on behalf of the organisation Right to Life Association for gifts to it to be tax deductible in accordance with section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Because the organisation did not come within the scope of any of the provisions of section 78 the application was not granted.
      </para>
      <para>
       The possibility of amending the law to include the Right to Life Association in the list of those specifically named in section 78 was also considered during the 1982-83 pre-Budget deliberations along with the many other requests received by the Government for new or extended taxation concessions. However, given the Government's desire to introduce broad measures of tax relief for the benefit of Australian families generally and a program of social security and welfare benefit increases, it was not found possible on this occasion to amend the law in the particular manner sought.

       (2) The Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States Government and the Australian Government relating to the procurement and co-production of a New Tactical Fighter Aircraft as presented to the Parliament by the then Minister for Defence on 18 November 1981 states at paragraph 24:
      </para>
      <para>
       'Should the United States aircraft production program be suspended or significantly reduced, or there be a significant change in cost factors or substantial delay or other default by the prime contractor, or performance resulting from trials of the aircraft and its weapons indicate to Australia that the aircraft and its weapons will not meet the basic characteristics or the performance requirements agreed to at the time of the acceptance of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance, or the national interests so require, the Australian Government may wish to cancel, suspend, or significantly reduce its purchases. To the extent practicable and subject to authorization and appropriation of funds by the United States Congress, the United States Department of Defence will endeavour to apply any material cancelled by the Australian Government toward the satisfaction of its own approved requirements in order to minimize cancellation costs to the Australian Government. This undertaking shall not relieve the Australian Government of its responsibility for net cancellation costs under the terms of the Letters of Offer and Acceptance.'
      </para>
      <para>
       This provision is also included in the Letter of Offer and Acceptance relating to Australia's 75 FA18 aircraft. Recognising the possibility of reduction in the production rate of FA18 aircraft in the early years of the program and the attendant possibility of increased costs, to contain such cost growth there are also provisions in the Letter of Offer and Acceptance which stipulate that the manufacture of the first of our aircraft should not precede a specified number of aircraft in the US program unless we decide otherwise.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. The Government has no advice to the effect that the future production of the FA18 is in doubt.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) If the sub contracts on Australian industry involved in the FA18 Australian Industry Participation Program are cancelled as a result of the US FA18 not being approved, Australian industry would have the right to recover accrued costs under the terms of the sub contracts negotiated between Australian industry and their US suppliers. As to the Australian Government's position in that event, the provisions of paragraph 24 of the Memorandum of Arrangements would generally apply.

       Four negotiating meetings for the Sixth International Tin Agreement were held in Geneva, namely, 14 April-14 May 1980, 1-18 December 1980, 9-26 March 1981 and 9-26 June 1981. Australia participated in all the negotiating sessions which succeeded in establishing the text of the current Agreement.

       Countries representing 50.31 per cent of total consumption percentage and 82 per cent of total production percentage notified by the due date, 30 April 1982, their intention to deposit instruments or had deposited instruments to participate in the Sixth Agreement. The United States declined to join and therefore the required percentage of total consumption (65 per cent) represented by consuming countries to enable the Agreement to enter into force provisionally was not met.

       However as provided for in the Agreement, governments of those countries which had, by 30 April 1982, notified of their intention to deposit instruments or had deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession met in Geneva on 10, 11 and 23 June 1982 and decided to bring the Sixth Agreement into force provisionally among themselves from 1 July 1982.

      <para>
       (2) Membership of the International Tin Agreement is consistent with Australia' s longstanding policy of support for international co-operation aimed at bringing greater stability into international commodity trade and expanding and improving the market for commodities. Australian membership is considered important to the success and continued viability of the Agreement and to protecting Australia's trade and economic interests through the only specialised international forum on world trade in tin. In this regard, representatives of the tin industry have recently confirmed the previously expressed view that, on balance, it was to Australia's advantage to be a member of the International Tin Agreement. In addition, there are broad trade and foreign policy reasons for adhering to the Agreement because it covers a commodity of particular concern to developing producing countries, including the ASEAN countries, and because it helps to promote the mutual interests of tin producing and consuming countries generally.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) Australia could not withdraw immediately from the International Tin Agreement without incurring a severe penalty. If Australia were to decide to withdraw, it would have to give 12 months notice after 1 July 1983 of its intention, in order to be entitled to a share of the proceeds of the liquidation of the buffer stock on the termination of the Agreement. In this regard, Australia has contributed $10.8m to the buffer stock under the Sixth International Tin Agreement. Until Australia's withdrawal became effective, Australia would be obliged to observe the provisions of the Agreement including export controls. A declaration of intention to withdraw could be expected to have serious repercussions for Australia's relations in tin matters with the remaining members of the Agreement, for the future of the Agreement itself and thus for the stability of the world tin market for some considerable time.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1), (2) and (3) The experience of the Foreign Investment Review Board is that there is not a high level of investment in beef cattle grazing properties on the part of Japanese investors. On the contrary, there has been relatively little interest shown by these investors in beef cattle grazing properties since the Board was established in 1976.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) There is no evidence to suggest that this type of investment should have an adverse effect on Australia's balance of payments. It is apparent that the level of Japanese investment in beef cattle grazing properties is very low in relation to Australia's beef industry and beef exports as a whole. The Government's policy requires that all foreign investment proposals be consistent with Australia's national interests, including in respect of such matters as the development of, or access to, new export markets; taxation considerations; and industry circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposed investments in beef cattle properties are assessed on their merits on the basis of the approach announced by the Treasurer on 20 January 1982 and outlined in Hansard on 9 September 1982 in response to the honourable senator's Question No. 1520.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government is not considering measures to limit investment in the Australian beef industry by investors from Japan or any other country. The administration of the foreign investment policy is non-discriminatory as to the country of origin of investors.

       The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       On 21 September 1982, the Minister for Defence, in response to Question Nos 4686 and 4687, informed the House of Representatives of Commonwealth-State responsibilities for civil defence and detailed action taken by the Commonwealth to fulfil its responsibilities.

      <para>
       From those statements the honourable senator would be aware that civil defence is primarily a State responsibility, but with Commonwealth support.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some State authorities have undertaken an analysis of the effects of a large disaster, including nuclear explosions on a major Australian city, for use in their counter disaster and civil defence planning. The general effects are well known. Effects specific to a city require detailed knowledge of that city including geographic and demographic factors.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth has provided support over recent years by organising a number of national studies and reviews at the Australian Counter Disaster College on subjects related to the effects on communities of major disasters. These have included a Mass Burns Casualty Management Study, a Port Disaster Seminar and a study on the Protection of the Public from Ionising Radiation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government rejects out of hand the suggestion that it does not support research on this subject. Equally, any suggestion that large additional resources should be poured into civil defence should be viewed most critically given the continuing assessments that attack is most unlikely, and other pressing demands for resources.

Is it a fact that in a television program produced by a Norwegian team and shown recently in a number of countries, visual and oral evidence was produced in relation to the huge number of people held in detention, without trial in Vietnam? Is it a fact that the number is not less than 15,000 and could be as high as 200,000 people? Since the war in Vietnam finished seven years ago, is it not a gross infringement of basic human rights that any of these people should continue to be held without trial? Will the Australian Government raise the matter in the United Nations and all other appropriate places to muster international pressure to force the Vietnamese Government to observe fundamental human rights?

       On 24 September this year Vietnam acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Vietnam has therefore now acknowledged the legitimacy of international scrutiny of its human rights record. As senators will be aware, the Covenant specifically proscribes detention without trial and maltreatment of detainees. Australia has been a consistent supporter of the Human Rights Committee, the body which supervises the implementation of the Covenant. Our Missions in New York and Geneva and our representatives to bodies such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights will be instructed to note Vietnamese violations at an appropriate opportunity.

       The Royal Australian Navy routinely uses charter aircraft under contract for specialised tasks such as target towing and for simple tasks such as radar tracking. In the case in question aircraft were required for anti-submarine air controller (ASAC) training. While Trackers would have been the preferred aircraft, insufficient Tracker hours remained available and pending revision of the FY 1982-83 estimates for this task, charter aircraft manned with naval Observers were used. Since that time Tracker hours for FY 1982-83 have been increased and further increases are being considered.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Piper Aztec aircraft used for the ASAC training were provided by Phoenix Airways, a Melbourne based company which currently holds the contracts for this particular type of aircraft and service. The RAN was advised recently by the Department of Defence Support that Phoenix Airways had gone into receivership but would continue to provide aircraft services under the terms of the contract while they attempted to trade themselves out of difficulty.
      </para>
      <para>
       The aircraft did suffer several minor routine unserviceabilities while operating out of NAS Nowra. The RAN did provide limited assistance in the rectification of several of these defects in preference to wasting valuable ship operating time due to cancelled or delayed sorties.
