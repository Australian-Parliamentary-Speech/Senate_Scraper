       (1) That in 1964 a Liberal/Country Party Government granted Mr Anthony M.P. a Commonwealth Government Home Loan Mortgage of $17,964 for a period of 45 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.75% and that at 1.9.1982 the amount of principal had only been reduced by $395.06, since 1.10.1981 leaving a balance of $14,609. 94.

       Tertiary Education Funding

      <para>
       To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate of Australia in Parliament Assembled. This petition of certain citizens of Australia concerned with continuing cuts in Federal Government funding of higher education respectfully showeth that the Federal Government cut-backs in funding have:

      <para>
       made it increasingly difficult for many Australians to contemplate study at a university or college of advanced education.

      <para>
       seriously jeopardized Australia's ability to keep pace with and contribute to technological developments in a whole range of areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       reduced the quantity and quality of community education programs offered, especially in rural colleges.
      </para>
      <para>
       forced universities and colleges of advanced education to cut back on the numbers of staff available to teach existing courses endangering the quality of education offering and narrowing the range of courses available.

Is the Minister further aware that strikes at Esso's Gippsland operation have cost the company $ 40m in lost income and a drop in production of 20 per cent and that Esso estimates that this, in turn has cost the Commonwealth and State governments some $560m in lost revenue? In view of this fact, what action does the Government intend to take in order to stop the rapacious actions of waterfront and seamen's unions which are holding up coastal shipping in 10 ports and four States, which have cost Queensland Alumina Ltd $2 1/2m over the past six weeks and which are stopping oil shipments to and from Port Stanvac in South Australia ?

         â€”My attention was drawn to the comments which were made on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM this morning, although I did not actually hear the program. With respect to the various questions asked by Senator Jessop I can only agree that disputes, whether they touch the oil industry or prevent the free movement of Australian imports and exports, are very serious and costly to Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Jessop will appreciate that I cannot verify the precise figures in dollars which Esso claims to have lost and which it claims the Government has lost because of strikes within Australia. But it is certainly true that strikes of the sort mentioned do have a considerable effect not just on the private companies or the private enterprise bodies which are involved and the workers who lose wages; indeed, there is also a clear loss of revenue to the Government. I think Senator Sir John Carrick would be able to give more detail than I can on the loss of revenue which has been occasioned because of the holding up of oil production in Australia, the losses that we sustained in connection with the oil levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Jessop mentioned current maritime disputes in his question. I can advise the Senate that the River Boyne which was held at Gladstone for several weeks because of demarcation disputes has now sailed, is returning to that port and is expected to resume its normal operations. The dispute about the River Boyne was the subject of a number of Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hearings. The parties concerned are committed to further talks which are aimed at reaching total resolution of the problem.

         â€”I think there are still to be talks between the parties. But as I said before, the ship is back in operation and it is hoped that it will continue in its normal operations henceforth. There is another serious dispute involving a number of maritime unions manning tugs at various Australian ports which is causing many ships to be delayed. The matter of dispute there concerns hours of work or rostered days off. The issues have been argued before a Full Bench of the Commission and a further hearing has been set down for 17 December. It is quite clear that there is very little gained by anybody, and indeed a great deal lost, both by strikes and by failing to comply with the requirements of the Arbitration Commission. Certainly if we get continued industrial action in this field it will continue to damage Australia's reputation as a reliable trader. That is something which we can ill afford in these very difficult economic times.

         â€”I am aware of the matters raised by Senator Chipp. I do not think there is any prospect of a direct diversion of funds from the wage freeze to welfare agencies of this sort. Rather, the Government is seeking to direct any savings which can be effected by a wages pause to capital works-which will be employment creating. As Minister for Social Security I support what I see as a very strong welfare element in that. Undoubtedly the major cause of pressure on the welfare agencies mentioned by Senator Chipp is the increase in unemployment. Indeed, the report to which he referred makes that point. Even staunching the increase in unemployment is an important element from the welfare viewpoint.

        The Commonwealth's involvement in emergency relief is relatively modest. For the last three or four years we have put half a million dollars into emergency relief Australia wide. That is a very small proportion of the total commitment to emergency relief around Australia. Traditionally that has been a matter which has been handled by State governments and voluntary agencies. It is a fact that the Victorian Government is rather less involved in the provision of emergency assistance than most State governments, so I think this is an area where some additional State activity would be warranted.
       </para>
       <para>
        I expect to be making decisions shortly concerning the distribution of about $ 125,000 to Victorian agencies. I think I am awaiting a recommendation from the Victorian Emergency Relief Committee at the moment. But in any event that is something which should occur shortly. A more substantial contribution though, which will, I think, impact favourably upon the sorts of agencies mentioned and upon the Victorian Government-there are some hundreds of welfare agencies in Victoria, I think some 600 or more-is the new mortgage and rent relief assistance which we are providing. Victoria will be getting, I think, $5.3m this year, which is a comparatively large sum in those fields. This contribution will be matched by the State Government and the money will be spent on mortgage and rent relief, which is usually a very important component of the requests which are made for emergency relief by people who are having difficulty in managing. This represents a very significant increase in emergency relief capacity in Victoria to which the Commonwealth is contributing 50 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the Commonwealth's responsibilities are concerned, there have been requests that we should become more heavily involved in the emergency relief field. In general, I have adopted the view on behalf of the Government that emergency relief should remain a matter for State governments and voluntary agencies with the Commonwealth commitment being to maintain as best it can an adequate income maintenance system which will remove the need for emergency relief as far as possible.

         â€”Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked me a series of questions relating to the dairy industry. It is a fact that there have been many adjustments within that industry over the last 10 years. Ten years ago milk production was over seven million litres, and last year it was a little over five million litres. This has brought about a very significant restructuring of that industry. We are going into the 1980s with a smaller industry, but it is a stronger one and it relies on export markets to a lesser extent than it did 10 years ago. So there is probably less danger now of domestic market disruption occurring in the absence of equalisation arrangements than in the past. It is worth noting, I think, that the Government recently referred to the Industries Assistance Commission the question of assistance to the Australian dairying industry. One of the matters that I expect the Commission to examine is the relevance of equalisation schemes in the current environment.

        Senator Bjelke-Petersen also asked about the situation of cheese imports and pointed out that EEC imports are coming into the country at a rate which has increased by 38 per cent in two years. It is a fact that consumption of cheese in Australia has been increasing but imports have been increasing at a faster rate than consumption. The local industry believes that it can produce the products to meet fair import competition but it is, of course, concerned about the prospect of dumping or any other form of unfair competition. In regard to imports of cheese from the EEC at subsidised prices, complaints were filed last week under the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. If dumped or subsidised exports are found to be harming the local industry, corrective action will follow immedately. Discussions have also been opening up with the EEC with a view to having restitutions on cheese exports to Australia withdrawn.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bjelke-Petersen also asked why there is no effective import controls and anti-dumping legislation. It is the belief of the Government that the anti- dumping legislation is effective, although it has been announced recently that it is to be strengthened. Indeed, we will have amending legislation in the Senate soon. Senator Bjelke-Petersen will have a chance to support that legislation in this place. We anticipate that that will increase the effectiveness of the anti-dumping arrangements in this country. The last part of the question asked what effect all these matters are having on the industry. Obviously, the industry is concerned at the current level of imports and at what it sees as unfair competition. The Government is committed to ensuring that unfair import competition does not drive down returns from the producer. That does not mean to say that there will be an end to competition from imports but rather that we should look to having an end to unfair competition and, in particular, to any dumping which may be found to have occurred.

         â€”Of course I totally disagree with the suggestion of gimmickry that is made by the honourable senator. He should ask his Victorian colleagues about the advertising which was taking place in Victoria which featured the Premier of Victoria at a time when State by-elections were proceeding. The fact of the matter is that the Government announced a whole range of changes to programs which were of benefit to the Australian community. On a number of occasions it has been drawn very forcefully to my attention that there is a need to publicise those programs. For example, at the Housing Ministers conference the point was made very forcefully by both Labor and Liberal Ministers present that there was a need for an advertising campaign to draw to the attention of home purchasers the benefits which are available in Commonwealth programs. I made the point to those Ministers that that could be seen as political advertising. In response to my point they reaffirmed that they thought the advertising was necessary.

        The Opposition spokesman, Senator Grimes, has suggested that the Department of Social Security needs to use a wider-ranging and more sophisticated type of advertising and that it should not just rely on newspaper advertising, although he has, of course, objected to the precise form of advertising we followed. The rationale for advertising by the Department of Social Security is that there is a great range of benefits and clients that it wishes to contact. To do that by tightly directed advertising to each group would result in our needing to take up virtually the whole of the advertising time on every television station. The use of television was, therefore, simply to draw attention to the other mediums of advertising which could give more detailed information. The newspaper advertisements, in turn, indicated that detailed information could be obtained from my Department either by contacting the Department, by writing or by sending in a coupon, in which case material would be sent out. Indeed, we have had a pretty good response to that. I have no difficulty in justifying that spending. I have done a number of things which were specifically suggested by the Opposition.

Let me make it quite clear that we will also be using the ethnic Press because another substantial area of difficulty has been in ensuring that benefits are understood by our very large immigrant population. I will get the precise figures. The advertising campaign was not run by my Department, except that it contributed to that part of the campaign which was relevant to social security matters. I will get the figures relevant to my Department and give them to the honourable senator. I would welcome even more specific suggestions than I have had in the past as to how we should go about the quite difficult task of ensuring that people who are entitled to benefits have their attention drawn to them. We have used a range of measures. We have used enclosures with cheques, we have used advertising on television and in the newspapers and we have used direct mailing.

My understanding is that the article in the Age has caught up some months after the event with a decision taken by the Commonwealth Schools Commission and endorsed by me regarding procedures which should be put into place to make the already rigorous testing of income even more rigorous in 1983. I think the journalist concerned was Mr Tom Ormonde. He came across something which had been ignored or missed by other journalists.

       <para>
        Since all non-government schools get a basic grant for each student, it is those schools which receive more than the basic grant which need their income tested. The schools that get only the minimum level will not get any less. Since they get the minimum level of grant anyhow, income testing is not an issue for them. It is for those schools that want to get more than the minimum grant that the procedures need to be applied. That is the reason why it has been decided to apply to all those seeking more than the minimum grant the more rigorous procedures laid down by the Schools Commission. As I said, these decisions were taken quite some time ago. We agree that the public interest requires that the rigorous testing already in place should be made even more effective. That is the reasoning behind the proposals which I believe were reported on Saturday.

I have some information which I think is relevant to the question on the applications to the Federal Court of Australia under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act concerning decisions under the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. The Court has not proceeded to a full hearing of the facts in any case so far. Finality has been reached in three cases in circumstances other than the Court proceeding to a hearing.

        The proceedings have resulted in each instance from decisions by the Comptrollers-General of Customs to require provisional measures in respect of imports for which there has been a finding of a prima facie case of dumping or subsidisation and consequent material injury to Australian industry and where the cases were considered to require provisional measures for the duration of the investigation of the complaint. Whether the history of these shows any fundamental defect is a matter which is not clear to me. I do not think it does. I will ask the Minister to consider the need for any further amendments and to give a further answer to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress that the Government sees it as important to have effective anti- dumping measures in place in 1982. Clearly the world trading conditions are such that there must be a very great temptation on exporters of both manufactured and other goods to put them on to the world market at dumped prices. The Government will be concerned to ensure that Australian producers are not subjected to unfair competition through this means.

         â€”I did read the article in the Weekend Australian to which Senator Martyr referred. It is a fact that Russia today has the largest, the most modern and the most rapidly growing naval force in the world. The evidence is that it has moved its forces progressively both into the Indian Ocean and into the Pacific Ocean. The victory for the communists in Vietnam was a significant victory for the dispersal of communist forces in the Pacific and elsewhere. It enabled the USSR to get a warm water port; Vladivostok is an icebound port for a large part of the year. Access to Cam Ranh Bay is the direct result of the victory for communism in Vietnam. It has enabled the USSR to disperse its forces and therefore to offer a significant threat in terms of an imbalance of forces in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Under those circumstances ANZUS becomes of enormous importance. It is the linchpin of the Australian defence system. It is the one assurance that we can have that in the Pacific Ocean there can be some balance. I stress that the communist victory in Vietnam and the securing of what was an American naval port, Cam Ranh Bay, has enabled Russia to get a naval port of immense strategic significance.

The Board was concerned that, in the highly competitive international market, Australia is the only substantial supplier that does not hold a long term contract with the USSR for the supply of wheat. That sort of long term agreement or understanding is a recognised feature of the Board's marketing strategy. Such agreements will be of particular importance when Australia's wheat production returns to normal. Sadly, that will not be a problem in 1982. The Minister for Primary Industry has advised the Chairman of the Board that it is a matter for commercial judgment as to the nature of the arrangements it pursues for future wheat sales to the Soviet Union. Any long term arrangement with the USSR wheat marketing authority should be discussed in the context of normal commercial negotiations.

Partially obscured on the label were the words 'anger Uranium'. The police, I think rightly, assumed that that might mean 'Danger Uranium', and notified the Atomic Energy Commission. It in turn notified the New South Wales Health Commission's relevant division. I am happy to say that the words on the box were 'Ranger Uranium'. Having been checked first with a geiger counter for safety reasons, it was found to contain stainless steel tubing and flanges. So in fact it was a consignment of ordinary materials on behalf of Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd. But I do not reflect upon the natural caution of the authorities there. They did the sensible thing. Happily, it was not radioactive material, and the incident is concluded.

Is it the all time record of $4 billion now forecast, or is it whatever figure the Fraser Government finally produces? Will he table the detailed revised estimates of receipts and expenditure?

         â€”I repeat that last week when I was asked a question I said that the Government had brought down a Budget that it considered had a very acceptable deficit, a conservative deficit, and that the figures in that Budget were given to the Government by the Treasury and not altered by the Government. The figures were supplied by the bureaucracy in this Government. Subsequent to that was the onset of a drought of immense consequences. No one could have predicted and still no one can predict the extent of the drought. Nevertheless, the Government has estimated the cost of the drought at $356m or $357m. Subsequently, unemployment rose at a rate and in a nature that had not been anticipated either by Treasury or the Government, particularly among mature aged and married people, with the result that not only the numbers but also the quantum of money for unemployment enlarged. As a result of that, it is necessary for the Government to do what must be done, that is, provide unemployment benefits. On both drought relief and unemployment benefit the Government is responding as it must.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The ideal deficit is one that will not bring undue pressure upon the money supply or upon interest rates. The Government had sought to have such a deficit, but due to an act of nature-the drought-and the pressure of overseas recession upon this country in terms of unemployment it has not been possible to obtain an optimum deficit. The Government has revised the deficit. It is very unhappy that it should be approaching $4,000m. Clearly, that will put pressure upon its refinancing and upon the loan market in borrowing and, therefore, a pressure on interest rates that we would not want. Of course, we do not like a deficit of that size. But in judging the deficit I remind the people of Australia that it is of a magnitude that was not in any way found unacceptable by people such as Mr Hawke and other spokesmen of the Australian Labor Party.

The figures that the Budget was constructed upon were given by the departments concerned, and notably by the Treasury. The figures on which unemployment estimates were based were Treasury figures. Neither Treasury nor anyone else could have anticipated the harsh onset of the world recession or the drought. As a result of that, of course it has been inevitable for the Budget to blow out. That is, in itself, serious because of the upward pressures it puts upon interest rates.

Is the Minister aware that the Merchant Service Guild of Australia, the union to which the shipwrights belong, has defied four different determinations by an arbitration commissioner that the winch should be operated , on mooring, by seamen? As this lawlessness has tied up the ship for seven weeks, has cost Queensland Alumina over $2.5m as of Friday of last week, in ship charges alone, and has occasioned the Comalco company in considerable additional expense at Weipa, which will lead to the retrenchment of some of its labour force in the near future, I ask: How many more jobs has the Merchant Service Guild to destroy and how much more damage has to be done to the Australian economy before the Government is prepared to deregister this union?

The dispute to which the honourable senator referred is the tying up of the vessel known as the River Boyne. It was held at Gladstone for some weeks and this caused significant losses. The vessel has now sailed and is expected to resume its normal operations. The question of the deregistration of the union evidences the strong dissatisfaction which would be felt not only by Senator MacGibbon but also by everyone who has been watching this dispute or who has been affected by it. I will refer the question to Mr Macphee for his consideration.

         â€”Does the Minister representing the Treasurer recall the document widely circulated and published by the Liberal Party secretariat describing the Australian Democrats proposed Budget of last August as 'a recipe for economic collapse' because it suggested a Budget deficit of the order of $4 billion? Why has a proposition which was regarded as 'a recipe for economic collapse' in August now been embraced by the Government, as disclosed in the Minister's answer to a question this afternoon when it was admitted that the deficit has now blown out to the order of $4 billion? Will the Minister admit that a deficit of the scale I proposed back in August would have stimulated the economy at that time, re-employed tens of thousands of Australians and reduced inflation without putting undue stress on interest rates?

         â€” The present projected deficit of about $4 billion results from the present economic circumstances. In part it relates to additional expenditure that has been undertaken and announced. It results also from lower receipts in almost every area of government revenue. The downturn in the economy and the shedding of employment have resulted in lower pay-as-you- earn collections than were projected. It has resulted in lower sales tax collections. Provisional tax collections on company profits are also expected to be considerably lower than was projected at the time of the Budget.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Budget proposals put forward by the Australian Democrats bear little relevance to the present economic circumstances. The fact that the Democrats happened upon a $4 billion deficit at the time of the Budget does not relate to the circumstances leading to the now projected figure for 1982-83. The Treasurer , in the context of discussing these matters with the Premiers this morning, released the figure that has recently been given to him. There are people who, in the context of those discussions, imagine that a further billion dollars or two billion dollars on the deficit would not really make any difference to the present economic circumstances. Many of them held that view when they thought the Budget deficit would be about $2 billion. Therefore, I think that if we are looking at figures at any particular time we need to look at the elements that constitute both sides of the Budget and result in a deficit. What was proposed at the time of the August Budget was a realistic figure on the projections that were given to us at that stage. The downturn in the economy has been at a much more rapid rate than I think anyone expected. Certainly, the shedding of employment has been at a much more rapid rate than anyone would have expected.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know whether the Budget proposals of the Democrats would have had the miraculous stimulus that the Democrats envisaged, given the overseas situation and the unavailability of expanding markets for us. So, I think we need to look at what was projected at the time our Budget was formulated and what is now the reality of a number of factors that have changed since that time. The fact that two figures seem to be the same does not mean that our Budget and the one proposed by the Democrats bear great comparison.

I have approved tasks, funding levels and periods of contracts to take effect from 1 January 1983 for the former children's services development officers sponsored by the City of Belmont, Western Australia, the City of Blacktown, New South Wales, the City of Randwick, New South Wales and the City of Blue Mountains, New South Wales.

       ALLEGED SOCIAL SECURITY CONSPIRACY CASE: DR NICOLAEDIS

         â€”Another matter which was raised by Senator Grimes last Thursday in Question Time concerned the role of a Dr Nicolaedis in the review of former Greek invalid pensioners which was undertaken by an Australian medical team in Athens last month. Senator Grimes implied in his question that the review team' s results would be biased against the pensioners and he queried the involvement of Dr Nicolaedis in light of his earlier involvement in these matters.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Following Senator Grimes's question I sought detailed advice from my Department on the matter and can now inform the Senate that there is no substance to the allegations in the question. I am advised that prior to the medical review team's departure for Greece, it stated that it would require the services of an interpreter familiar with medical terminology. The selection of interpreters and external Greek specialists was left, by necessity, to the discretion of staff at the Australian Embassy in Athens who have the requisite local knowledge. The services of a Greek panel doctor, Dr Nicolaedis, were accepted for interpreting duties on the basis that the doctor had been used by the Australian Government for several years. The identity of the doctor was not known to my Department. I would say, however, that the medical review team had no reservations about Dr Nicolaedis and commended the way in which he undertook his strictly limited and defined duties.
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of Senator Grimes's question, it is worth stressing that Dr Nicolaedis 's role as an interpreter was deliberately confined by the team to interpreting duties. The medical review team has advised that he did not attend the team's discussions on the findings of any examination, nor did he take part in the preparation of reports or recommendations to the Director-General of my Department. The team has stated categorically that Dr Nicolaedis was entirely neutral in his role of interpreter. Dr Nicolaedis is a radiologist and, on occasions, he was requested to take additional X-rays as requested by the review team. The team has commented that the X-rays provided were manifestly of the patients in question and the quality of the X-rays were found to be entirely satisfactory. It is most important to note that Dr Nicolaedis was not asked and did not provide any evaluation of the X-rays he took. This evaluation was left entirely to the review team which was itself competent in this area. Again, Dr Nicolaedis was not present at such discussions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is clear that Dr Nicolaedis's involvement in the earlier reviews has not influenced in any way the course of the current review. Consideration is currently being given by the Director-General to the team's findings. I suggest to Senator Grimes that when the outcome of those findings is known he may wish to speak with me further on the matter. The allegations put forward by Senator Grimes last week were first advanced to the Australian Embassy in Athens by the Greek-Australian Pensioners' Association in Greece during the team's examinations. The allegations were rejected by the medical review team. I am proposing to make copies of the correspondence available to Senator Grimes today.
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of the very great effort that has been made by my Department to ensure a careful re-examination of these cases under the most objective conditions, I have made that fairly full response to the question because I would want any queries which are raised to be answered both to the satisfaction of Senator Grimes and to the satisfaction of any members of the public who are interested in the matter.

         â€” On 25 November Senator Teague asked me a question about the information resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following response to Senator Teague's question. Professor Millar's article in the publication Australian Foreign Affairs Record makes a number of favourable comments on the Department' s operations and effectiveness. There is no doubt that the professional operations of the Department require readily accessible information and research materials, as well as trained and experienced officers capable of offering the highest standard of advice to Ministers and an effective service to the public. The Department maintains a standard filing system, which suffices for most tasks, and a specialist library. Officers also have ready access to background documents and publications covering the range of foreign affairs interests.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Department has substantially upgraded its information distribution and retrieval system through the application of computer technology to the Diplomatic Communications Network. A study is now being made of the possibilities of using computer technology to cover other departmental documents so that information retrieval would be improved over existing filing systems. The effectiveness of departmental advice depends heavily on the day to day assessment and advice of our missions overseas, which monitor and report on issues and developments of direct concern to Australian foreign policy. This is one of the most efficient and responsive areas of departmental activity, the effectiveness of which has been enhanced by the application of new techniques.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department attempts to encourage as much specialisation of its officers as is practicable, whether in functional areas or on the basis of their geographical experience, thereby retaining and building upon their expertise for application both overseas and in Australia. Staffing policy is also aimed at ensuring that officers in key policy areas in the central office spend longer periods there between overseas postings. At the same time, the rotation of officers between home and overseas postings needs to be balanced to maintain an effective foreign service overall. A recent development in the Department is an agreement in principle by the Public Service Board to a reorganisation of the Department's top structure. One result of this will be to restore a policy planning role to the Department and relate this more closely to the overall advancement of Australian strategic interests.

I advise Senator Mulvihill that Standing Order 36AB, which governs the operations of Estimates committees, does not empower Estimates committees to send for persons, papers and records. The attendance of officers before Estimates committees is a matter for the relevant Ministers and departments. Therefore suggest that Senator Mulvihill approach the Minister representing the Minister for Defence and ask him to arrange for the relevant officers to appear before Estimates Committee D when it meets during the autumn sittings next year. Alternatively, or additionally, he may care to discuss the matter with the Chairman of the Committee, in order to provide notice to the Department from the Committee of his areas of interest-a practice which is followed by Estimates committees in the normal course of their activities.

        That the Senate take note of the Government's response to the Progress Report of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment on the River Murray tabled in the Senate on 2 December 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regret that I was not in the Senate at the time of the presentation of the Government response. I was not informed about it and therefore I sought leave to take note of the paper today. I regard this report as quite important and regret very much that it took 12 months for the Government to respond to it. The Committee went to Adelaide, having been alerted to the closure of the River Murray mouth at that time. It considered that as a matter of public interest and urgency it should do so. The Committee submitted its report in November 1981 and it has taken 12 months for the Government to respond. I should like the Government to take note of that criticism because it is not the first time that chairmen of committees have risen in this place and requested that more attention be given by the Government to responding far earlier to these important reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The response took the form of a letter written to me on 11 November by the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick. One or two of the Committee's recommendation were accepted. Among them was 1 (a) which stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The River Murray Commission be empowered to undertake an integrated and comprehensive approach to the problems of the River Murray.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Government has responded in part to that recommendation, perhaps not as fully as we would like it to; but at least the River Murray Waters Agreement has been altered to a degree that the River Murray Commission now has some more say as far as water quality is concerned. Recommendation 1 (b) states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth and State Governments should consider the establishment of a national body to determine water quality standards and to set guidelines with respect to future development along all Australian river systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        That recommendation was contained in an earlier report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment which dealt with a progress report on the River Murray. It was also a recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution headed by former Senator Davidson a number of years ago. As indicated in the report that we have presented it was also recommended by the former South Australian Government, under Premier Tonkin. The report stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The South Australian Government sees the problem facing the River Murray as a serious national one in which the Commonwealth Government must take the lead for its early resolution. The South Australian proposal is based on the Commonwealth Government initiating the necessary works and measures which will enable the Commonwealth and the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments , through the River Murray Commission, to manage the River Murray in concert and in harmony and in such a way that both the rights of the three States and those of all users of the River Murray are protected. The South Australian Government in its Bicentennial proposal has also recognised that a permanent solution to the problems of the River Murray has been frustrated by the Australian consititutional framework.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee therefore recommends that the Commonwealth Government give serious consideration to the proposals put forward by the South Australian Government aimed at achieving a permanent solution to the River Murray salinity problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is still quite important that the Government deal with those recommendations, particularly now when there is a drought. Unless we come to grips with the challenge that is thrown out with respect not only to the River Murray system but also, as out report states, to all river systems in Australia, I am afraid that by the year 2050 the development of this country will be seriously impeded, if it has not stopped altogether. I think it is a matter that transcends individual States and the Commonwealth. It is a national problem with which we need to deal. I asked a question about the Delaware River Basin Commission three weeks ago last week. I suggested that that was an example of co -operative federalism. The Commission has extraordinary powers and seems to be managing quite well despite the fact that four or five States are involved as well as the Federal Government. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.

         â€”by leave-I take it that the document which we are discussing is a letter dated 11 November 1982 which was addressed to Senator Jessop. I will be brief in my remarks. Having read the document, I think something needs to be corrected. In part of the document, the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) said:

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I understand that it is not uncommon for a sandbar to develop at the mouth of the River Murray in late summer or autumn, when practically all available flows in the river are used for urban and agricultural supplies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was attracted to that statement because I hoped that Senator Sir John Carrick would make a similar statement about this time last year or some time earlier when the then Minister of Water Resources in the Tonkin Liberal Government was castigating the New South Wales Labor Government. He was on public record as saying that the New South Wales Government was stealing South Australian's water and that was the cause of the sandbar building up at the mouth of the River Murray and closing it over. Great publicity was achieved by the then Minister. A lot of taxpayers' money was spent in engaging heavy machinery to cut channel through the mouth of the River Murray. I said at the time that it was political expediency on the part of that Government when it claimed that the New South Wales Labor Government was stealing its water. Mr Tonkin was on record as saying that the then South Australian Government was contemplating cutting off gas supplies from the Moomba Basin to New South Wales if it did not stop stealing water. I flew over the mouth of the River Murray a few weeks ago and it is very near to being closed over again. However, I think that the letter said that it has depth of 6 metres. I doubt whether that is the depth of the Murray River there now because it has very nearly closed again.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we debate the River Murray in this chamber and when State governments, particularly the South Australian Government, seek to safeguard our water supply -we in South Australia depend mainly on the River Murray-we have to take a reasonable point of view. We should not engage in cheap politicking. We should not try to score cheap political points such as the Tonkin Government did with its Minister of Water Resources, Mr Arnold. I am very happy to say that Mr Arnold is no longer the Minister. Mr Slater is now the Minister. We will get some cohesion between the three States involved because they are three Labor States-New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. I hope that-

       <para>
        Of course the National Water Research Council came into being only after my friend and colleague from South Australia, Mr Ralph Jacobi, introduced in the other place a Bill to set up an Institute of Freshwater Studies. That Bill was passed by the Senate and sent to the House of Representatives where it is still languishing on the Notice Paper. The Government will not bring it forward for debate or decision. I give Mr Jacobi due credit for the research that he did to bring that Bill into being and to introduce it in the other place. I was given the privilege of introducing it in this chamber. I was very pleased when the Australian Democrats joined with the Labor Opposition and we were able to pass the Bill. That institute is the body that should be brought into being in this country, not the National Water Research Council. We should have an Institute of Freshwater Studies as envisaged by Mr Jacobi. I venture to say that will happen when Labor returns to government. I am not criticising the people who make up the National Water Research Council but to some extent they are hamstrung. If we had this Institute of Freshwater Studies I am quite sure that the whole water problem in Australia would be looked at in a much clearer light. We would be able to come to a solution to the problem which has now been brought home to us all by this very severe drought.

         â€”The Northern Territory (Self- Government) Amendment Bill 1982 was introduced into the House of Representatives in the first sitting week of the Budget session, which session is now in its fourth month. It has taken that considerable period to move across King's Hall for the consideration of the Senate. I think that is but an indication of the way in which the Government has developed its program in this place over the last three to four months. However, having said that, the Opposition indicates that it does not intend to oppose the Bill, which naturally follows and seeks to make a number of adjustments to the principal Act of 1978 which gave self- government to the Northern Territory. I suppose it is natural that there needs to be some amendments following the operation of the original act.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The major function of the Bill is to confirm and clarify the rights of the Commmonwealth in respect to minerals on lands which were reacquired by the Commonwealth Government after the declaration of self-government for the Northern Territory. It is natural that mineral rights over those lands should be vested in the Federal Government. The Bill also deals with the length of time prior to a general election in which a vacancy in the Legislative Assembly must be filled. It deals also with indemnifying the Treasurer in respect of loans which the Treasurer has given a guarantee. The Opposition does not quibble with the legislation on that point, but we wonder why there is a need to remove sub- section (7) from section 47. It is conceded that it is a discretionary sub- section and that it allows the Commonwealth Treasurer to ask for an indemnity in exchange for a guarantee, should the Treasurer require that. Another amendment will in fact move some of the sections of the Act more towards self-government provisions. So in that sense, it is part of the evolution of self-government in the Northern Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will increase the number of people who can have dormant warrants, but basically it has been introduced in this House in order to protect Commonwealth rights over Commonwealth lands in the Territory against the issue of mining leases or the use of land for that type of purpose. It is a provision which may well be necessary in other forms of legislation in respect of Commonwealth land, but this provides what we see as adequate protection for the land in that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also gives the Commonwealth, and rightly so, clear rights and clear authority over minerals found in Commonwealth land. Therefore, the Commonwealth has control over mining of this land. Of course, the question of mining is very vexed. It has been very vexed in respect of the Northern Territory, because when we talk about mining any of our natural resources there we have to have regard for the rights of the Aboriginal communities, whose living conditions and environment would be drastically altered by such mining development and in many cases would suffer. We also have to have regard for the environmental aspects because a great amount of the land which appears to have mineral resources situated under the surface is in national parks. We also have the problem of the nuclear fuel cycle which the Northern Territory has some particular interest in.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we talk about mineral rights on Commonwealth land in the Northern Territory we are talking about a number of features which have to be considered. When we talk about it in that sense the question of the mining of uranium is raised. I would like to make some comments to make the position of the Australian Labor Party clear. It is our clear and unequivocal policy that no future uranium mining will be allowed to develop. We will be pulling Australia out of any links in the nuclear fuel cycle. This will involve firstly, the phasing out of current uranium mining commitments and secondly, a refusal to allow further development to go ahead. Labor will be using all its Commonwealth powers to ensure that this policy is carried out.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mention here also the Labor Party's policy on the situation as it now exists in the Northern Territory, particularly in relation to those important areas I have referred to-environment, Aborigines, the nuclear fuel cycle and national parks. Stage 1 of the Kakadu National Park, which has been a concern of the Senate and particularly of Senator Mulvihill over a long period, was declared in 1975. However, Stage 2, which is a larger area than Stage 1, has yet to be proclaimed. Perhaps the Government recognises its obligations in this area. If it is the Government's intention to declare Stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park this Bill will certainly facilitate the process. Traditional Aboriginal land owners through their land trust are required to lease sections of their land in the Alligator Rivers area to the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service for declaration as a national park. During the complex process of granting Aboriginal land claims and then the establishment of the Kakadu National Park the Fraser Government excised the sensitive areas of Ranger, Jabiluka and Koongara for the purposes of uranium mining. To that extent concern was expressed in the Aboriginal movement, the environment movement and the peace movement in Australia about those moves taken by the Government, particularly as it was for the purpose of uranium mining.
       </para>
       <para>
        Koongara is now a uranium mining enclave within Stage 1 of the Kakadu National Park. When Stage 2 is declared the Ranger and Jabiluka areas may also become uranium mining enclaves within the Park itself. It is necessary to expedite the full transfer of the Alligator Rivers Aboriginal land claims and to establish Stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park including those mines which would not proceed under Labor's anti-uranium mining policy. I am sure there is a concern in Australia for these matters. One has only to look at the writing on ballot papers on conservation matters during the Flinders by-election over this last weekend. I think it is a tremendous event of citizen consciousness when we have 41 per cent of such people commenting on ballot papers-it is true that most of the comments appear to be on Labor ballot papers, but a substantial number of Australian Democrats and Liberal Party people also exercised their right to express that view in a voluntary way during the Flinders by-election. I think that indicates a tremendous concern in the Australian community about conservation issues as they relate of course to South West Tasmania.
       </para>
       <para>
        Writing on ballot papers is one way in which people on the mainland of Australia have been able to express themselves in a non-legislative way. I think that probably indicates that something like two-thirds of the Australian people feel very strongly about South West Tasmania. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party believes that same concern is expressed about uranium mining. Of course, I am speaking in this debate not only as a result of my concern and my shadow ministerial capacity but also at the request of Senator Robertson who is not here but who is convalescing in hospital after an operation last week. I know that if he is listening to the broadcast he will be endorsing the remarks I am making in respect of these problems because he has expressed concern both within the party and to me personally about his interest in and concern for this legislation and all that flows from it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Parks and Wildlife Service has overall management responsibility for Uluru-Mount Olga National Park, but the Northern Territory Conservation Commission provides day to day management. In the current financial year, 1982- 83, half a million dollars will be allocated by the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory Government for this purpose. Of course, that positive step will be endorsed and continued when a Federal Labor Government is elected in 1983. I think we can concede that there will not be an election in 1982, although there has been no denial of an early election. I think we can say in the latter weeks of this session that the election will take place in 1983. The Labor Party is very confident about what the Australian people will do when the election is held.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two more points I want to make briefly before finishing. Firstly, the Government saw fit originally to make the term of the Northern Territory parliament four years and has decided to maintain that. I think honourable senators recall that we, on this side of the House, have attempted this year to take steps towards encouraging the Commonwealth Government to move towards a four-year parliamentary term for the Federal Parliament and to regularise the ways in which electoral reform can be enacted towards stabilising the position in respect of the rights of the Senate and the House of Representatives. We have not always been successful in that, but our objectives have been clearly set out by Senator Evans and by me. Secondly, the section relating to the nomination for parliament and the holding of office is much more reasonable than the one that currently persists for the national Parliament. It allows for the resignation from public office at the time of nomination rather than 14 days prior to nomination, which we are shackled with federally. I am sure that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) will agree with me that this is an anomaly. It affects the rights of persons in the Public Service and in State parliaments. There are certain restrictions. This Bill seeks to remedy the situation in respect of the Northern Territory. It is about time that we took those steps nationally to overcome some of those anomalies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lastly, I am still at a loss to know why section 71 needs to be amended to allow 'the Northern Territory' to be substituted for 'the Commonwealth' in contracts that may have been drawn up in the last four years. It was concluded that this was necessary, at the time the principal Act was prepared and debated in the Parliament but it was not proceeded with. However, the updating bears no relationship to the other amendments. What contracts, for example, have been drawn up in the last four years that would be affected by this amendment? There was no suggestion in the second reading speech why these matters have now been rectified. It would be interesting to know the intentions of the Government and why it has decided that these changes should now be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated earlier, the Opposition does not intend to oppose the Bill. The Bill has a number of machinery provisions which establish the rights of the Commonwealth with respect to mining in the Northern Territory. We think that is a positive step forward. It also removes some of the anomalies which exist as a result of the evolution of self-government in the Northern Territory. To that extent, the Opposition gives this Bill its support.

         â€”I thank honourable senators for the support they have expressed for the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill. It is a small Bill. It amends the principal Act as has been said by Senator Geitzelt. I think the honourable senator concedes that it does not concern uranium mining or Aboriginal land. It does concern a number of matters relating to self-government in the Northern Territory. I will answer only two points raised by Senator Gietzelt to obviate the need for a lengthy debate in the Committee stage. He asked a question about clause 9 of the Bill, which relates to borrowings other than from the Commonwealth. Our advice is that the section to be deleted is no longer needed. The Commonwealth is adequately protected without that section. The Treasury believes it is no longer needed. For that reason it seems appropriate to delete it from the principal Act. It seems to us to be just a tidying up measure. As the honourable senator said, the matters are not of great consequence, but that is the reason behind that one.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        He also asked about clause 12 which amends section 71 of the principal Act. A number of contracts have been entered into. Three periods are involved. There is the period before self-government, the period from self-government until now and any succeeding periods. A number of contracts are involved, including simple contracts for cleaning which may have been entered into with the Commonwealth but which properly should be transferred to the Territory for administrative purposes. The provision proposed in clause 12 will simply enable that to happen. With those two explanations, I thank honourable senators for their support and commend the Bill to the Senate.

        â€”I indicate briefly that the Opposition supports the Bounty (Berry Fruits) Bill 1982. I do so on behalf of Senator Walsh who is unable to be here today. The Bill provides assistance for the production of fresh berry fruits which are used for processing. An important part of the legislation is that it provides a bounty, and the bounty will be paid to the producers. In essence, it implements the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its report of 21 August 1981 entitled 'Fruit and Fruit Products'. A bounty was preferred by the Government in this case because much of the jam and juice manufactured in this country is in fact manufactured from imported fruit. The bounty is payable at the rate of $100 per tonne and is paid directly to the growers based on information provided by the processors. So at least we know that the bounty is to be paid to those who produce the fruit. This is particularly important for the berry fruit producers in Tasmania who produce, apart from strawberries, some 90 per cent of the berry fruits produced. Tasmania has some 250 berry fruit producers.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The scheme will operate for five years from 1 July this year and the cost in the first year is expected to be some $300,000. It is hoped that in this and subsequent years it will provide assistance for the berry fruit producers in this country to improve their technology and their methods generally and to increase their production. This is important, particularly in my State where in recent years berry fruit producers have had a pretty bad time. This is the equivalent of tariff assistance of about 10 per cent, in keeping with the IAC's recommendation.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I said, the Opposition prefers bounties as a form of assistance. It is to be hoped that this bounty, which has been recommended by the independent inquiry, will assist berry producers in competition with other countries, in particular New Zealand. I am aware that berry growers are worried by imports generally, in particular imports from New Zealand, and about what will happen to those imports after the closer economic relations agreements are finalised. But there is already essentially free trade between Australia and New Zealand under the present New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which includes berries in schedule A. I do not believe there should be too much difficulty. But for the first few years of CER with the New Zealand producers at present getting 10 per cent assistance as an export incentive and with some of them continuing to receive the suspensory loans that they have been receiving, life may be difficult for some of our berry producers. I am sure that all Tasmanian members of parliament and certainly the Tasmanian berry fruit producers will be watching this very carefully.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have said, we believe this assistance to the industry is justified. We believe we must watch the industry very closely in the future to make sure that it is not damaged by closer economic relations with our neighbour across the Tasman. I hope that the assistance will result in a more efficient, larger and more effective industry in this important area.

        â€”I also support the Bounty (Berry Fruits) Bill 1982. I think it is worth noting that this is about the twentieth occasion on which this Bill has appeared on the Notice Paper this session. In common with what are normally referred to as 'small Bills' it goes on the bottom of the list in case there is some necessity for a stuffer at some time to keep the program going. Nevertheless, to the small fruit industry it is not an unimportant Bill. I support it because it provides a bounty, which is more appropriate than a tariff. It is important to Tasmania and to other selected parts of Australia even though at present the industry is fairly small. In Tasmania in particular there were times when it was a much bigger industry than it is today. Over the passage of time it has lost ground so that now it is a fairly small but hard- core industry which is endeavouring to grow. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a schedule from the Industries Assistance Commission report on fruit and fruit products showing the quantities and values of the various fruits.

        â€”The berry fruits industry is important inasmuch as it deals with small areas of land and small holdings. Fewer than 5 per cent of berry fruit farms are greater than five acres in area. Farmers live in all sorts of out of the way areas on small pockets of land. Decentralisation is more than just a notion and it needs to be pursued. Diversified industries in these areas should be encouraged. The importation of fruit for processing purposes causes a lot of difficulty. It usually comes in in fairly large quantities, without planning or notice. This leaves the local producers in difficulty when they come to dispose of their main crops. I have four further tables which show, firstly, the production of processed fruit for Tasmania; secondly, the prices paid by producers; thirdly, New Zealand berry fruit production; and, fourthly, import statistics. I seek leave to incorporate those tables in Hansard.

       * A 2-tier price was set for blackcurrants for the 1981-82 season. Fruit sold on the domestic (Australian) market attracted a price of 80c; the export market 55c. An advance, paid by producers on receipt of fruit, of 60c was made. The final payment depended on the sales mix of export and domestic sales and was calculated as 10.282 cents per kilogram making the total payment to growers by processors of 70.282 cents per kilogram.

        â€”I included New Zealand's figures because they are very important now and they will become more important in the years ahead. At present the processing of fruit produces about $2.25m for the Tasmanian industry. About $400 ,000 of that amount goes to the fresh fruit market. Of this total about $1.75m is actually available to the growers. I may have made an error earlier on this. The value of the fruit to the processing industry in Tasmania is about $2.25m. Of this the growers receive about $1.75m. There is no doubt that there is great potential and there could be achievements if the matter were handled properly. I am not convinced at present that the Tasmanian industry is operating under the best marketing scheme. I think this matter needs a certain amount of rethinking and reorganising. I believe the industry is not organised sufficiently to maximise potential markets. I would have to say that it is substantially hamstrung at present by the lack of plant variety rights legislation.

       I read a release from the British High Commission only in the last few days headed 'New soft fruit has promising future'. The item states that the tayberry, a new soft fruit developed in Scotland, will shortly go into commercial production. So it may, but it will not happen in Tasmania or elsewhere in Australia because of the lack of PVR. There is no way in which we can get our hands on a new variety such as that. It is said that the tayberry has performed particularly well in canning and jam making tests. It is also suitable for freezing. These are the sorts of qualities which people are looking for in berry fruits. Regrettably we do not have access to those things.
      </para>
      <para>
       A few months ago I was able to visit some research stations in the United Kingdom. I was terribly impressed with the extensions to the varieties that they have produced which are unavailable to us. These include varieties which are appropriate for their long carriage or easy freezing qualities. Various species are appropriate for the juice market only and so on. Our industry is being held back. The Dr Doolittle community in Australia, the people who are trying to hold us back from all sorts of developments and progress, have a lot to answer for. While we are being held back, for various reasons which I do not understand, other countries are going past us. It is regarded as smart to stop industries progressing with the use of new varieties and so on which are developed overseas .
      </para>
      <para>
       I incorporated the table showing New Zealand production because I see New Zealand as being very much a part of our future. Over the years ahead the development of our industry will be very much tied to the development of New Zealand and its industry. If honourable senators look at the New Zealand figures they will see that since 1978 New Zealand's raspberry production has doubled. Its blackcurrant production is up 2 1/2 times; boysenberries 3 1/2 times; strawberries 4 times; and loganberries and gooseberries considerably more than that. New Zealand has found that there is a market. Recently I found that gooseberries from New Zealand were being sold in Germany at $6 a kilo during their off-season market. The Bounty (Berry Fruits) Bill gives us time to catch up. It gives us time to develop, organise and work with New Zealand on establishing a sound base to trade in the off-season market of the Northern Hemisphere and to relieve the Australian market of the sudden influx of fruits which come, unheralded at times, from New Zealand. I believe that by working with New Zealand, as I hope we will from now on, we should be able to remove this problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       At present soft fruits are coming in to Australia duty-free. This is part of the old New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Under CER they will still come in duty-free but if they can be shown to have been dumped from New Zealand or from any other source, action can be taken where necessary. I hope it will not be necessary. I hope that we will be able to work closer with New Zealand and to develop new markets instead of doubling up on the ones that already exist . I believe that there are markets in North America and East Asia and South East Asia that we should be able to capitalise on without damaging one another.
      </para>
      <para>
       The industry has had much difficulty in overcoming a shortage of statistical information. Because it is a small industry such details have never been attended to as those in the industry would have wished. Those people involved in the Soft Fruit Industry Board have sought changes in government statistical information. I have a copy of a letter which they have written, in which they specify what they would like to have done. I wish to include some of the details of this letter in Hansard because I think it is important that their wishes be understood. They have been in touch with the Bureau of Statistics and the Bureau is investigating the possibility of providing figures in the format that they require.
      </para>
      <para>
       They are asking specifically for five sets of figures: Firstly, specific tonnage required by the Australian market; secondly, the form in which the end user requires that fruit; thirdly, the price paid by Australian users; fourthly, from where users currently obtain their supplies; and fifthly, possible alternatives for underdeveloped uses of fruit. They believe that if they can get the necessary co-operation and have that information provided, certainly they will be better able to meet the market and supply what is required in the form that it is required.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again I find it necessary to draw attention to the New Zealand incentives. Whilst we do not wish that type of operation to be set up in Australia, we must consider that it has placed New Zealand in a very advantageous position. I hope that with the restructuring of CER negotiations some of these benefits will come back on a reasonable basis to our growers. The bounty that we are speaking about represents about 10 per cent on factory prices in an industry that produces about 10,000 tonnes of fruit a year. Because of the location of the industry, it has many advantages in that it is labour intensive, it has good export potential , and a first class growth capacity fostered by suitable local conditions. It is an industry that deserves support. Tasmania has skilled people, small holdings and the right conditions. Certainly the industry can progress. While I support the Bill, I hope that after the five-year duration of this arrangement it will not be necessary to extend it.

        â€”The Australian Democrats support the Bounty ( Berry Fruits) Bill. It is amazing that a Bill that has all-party support and has been on the Notice Paper for at least the past six weeks, if not longer, could not have been brought on for debate earlier and disposed of. It seems to me that a little more constructive thought as to the order of business in the Senate may enable us to get out of the way more quickly some of the Bills that are supported by all parties. Be that as it may, this Bill gives practical effect to a particularly sensible recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission which the Government accepted on 21 April this year. For once the Government has acted even reasonably promptly in translating an IAC recommendation into law. Just over 13 months have elapsed since the report of the IAC was published. Honourable senators will be aware that I have no great love of the IAC. I have fought too many fights with that august body of wiz-kid economic purists to be a servile acceptor of its advice. However, I am happy to say that the report that gave rise to this Bill is an exception to the general run of IAC reports, which consistently seem to advocate the dismantling of Australian industry.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Senator Grimes indicated that the Australian Labor Party favours bounties, not tariffs. I am particularly fascinated by the variable position taken by the IAC. In this case it has recommended a bounty and not a tariff. Yet, in the wheelchair case which we debated some time ago earlier this year, the reverse was the case. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) whether he can explain the reasons for this difference. One time the IAC recommends a tariff and another time it recommends a bounty. Is it that the IAC is an authority that capriciously makes recommendations that the Government then accepts as a matter of course? Does it have some black box out of which one answer pops one day and another answer the next day? The Government seems to find it necessary to accept these answers presumably on the basis of economic efficiency. The Democrats welcome this Bill as a sensible approach to an industry that has been calling for assistance for some time. May there be many more intelligent and constructive reports from the IAC. We support the Bill.

        â€”With my two Tasmanian colleagues, Senator Archer and Senator Grimes, who have already spoken in this debate, I support the Bounty (Berry Fruits) Bill 1982. This legislation is much needed. I well recall visiting the Huon area some time ago with my predecessor, Sir Reginald Wright. As we drove through the hills and valleys he felt a deep feeling of despair and concern at the decline of the berry fruit industry, particularly in the Huon Valley of Tasmania. This legislation, which seeks to provide a bounty to the extent of $100 per tonne or 10c per kilogram, will certainly provide a shot in the arm to the industry, which is now not so great as it was.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This legislation applies to a wide range of berry fruits including bilberries, black currants, blackberries, blueberries, boysenberries, cranberries, elderberries, gooseberries, loganberries, mulberries, raspberries, red currants, rowanberries, strawberries, white currants and youngberries. Essentially the industry in Tasmania is fairly small. The legislation applies to fruit which is to be used for processing. The Bill specifically states that the Comptroller- General of Customs must be satisfied that the fruit is of good and merchantable quality. This is a significant provision.
      </para>
      <para>
       The industry sought to have fruit in stock covered by the legislation but that application was rejected. The legislation applies only to fruit produced in the course of carrying on the business of cultivating bountiable fruit which is harvested or picked in the bounty period-that is 1 July this year for five years until June 1987. The legislation also requires that the processor complete the carrying our of the first or only process to which the fruit is subject at registered premises during the bounty period. So the fruit must be produced within the bounty period. The legislation does not cover items in stock, which are quite substantial at the moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is an important piece of legislation for the local juice and jam industry. It will tend to keep the costs down and give a degree of competitiveness. The Tasmanian climate and soils are particularly conducive to this form of agriculture. My colleague Senator Archer indicated that the industry was pressing for plant variety rights legislation. He drew attention to a new type of berry that could be introduced and pointed out that because Australia does not yet have PVR that type of fruit is being denied to the Australian market. The industry is also pressing for the introduction of improved varieties of existing fruits such as blackcurrants. It wants introduced improved varieties in terms of yield, texture, quality and so on. However, this would be possible only through PVR legislation. We hope that following the report on PVR from the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources the Senate will be in a position speedily to pass legislation which the berry fruit industry requires with a good degree of urgency.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another matter about which the industry and I have some concern is the position of the industry under closer economic relations with New Zealand. New Zealand export incentives are to be phased out between 1985 and 1987. Many people within the industry are concerned about what might happen during this period. No doubt this Bill, which proposes a 10c per kilo bounty, will help the industry. Goods from New Zealand which are put on the Australian market at subsidised values can have an adverse effect on our industry. We hoped that the phase-out period of export incentives could have been introduced earlier. However, it has not been possible to negotiate such an arrangement. Therefore, I think the industry will have to recognise that there is to be a period of hardship because of the unevenness of the incentives.
      </para>
      <para>
       My colleague in the other place, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), whose electorate covers the main berry producing areas of Tasmania, referred to the need for an orderly marketing system. Over the years the industry has had certain difficulties in the marketing area. I know that the industry is addressing itself to this matter at the moment. One of the difficulties the Australian industry faces is that a lot of the imports are in the form of a concentrated product. I am rather pleased that as a result of a number of representations-certainly I made some on behalf of the industry-the Australian Bureau of Statistics has now agreed to provide additional statistical information in relation to the berry fruit industry. This will have the effect of assisting the industry in handling dumping type problems from overseas. Because it is a small industry there was a certain aggregation of items which made it difficult for individual producers of, say, blackberries or blueberries to be able to pinpoint the damage to the industry which might occur from dumped products from overseas. I very much welcome this Bill. It will be a Bill that will substantially help the industry. Providing the industry can rejuvenate its marketing arrangements, and with the possible introduction of new varieties of berry fruits from overseas and with improved technology I believe in the long term the industry will be able to reverse some of the problems that it has had in the past and return to being a viable industry within the Tasmanian economy. I hope that the Bill has a speedy passage.

        â€”I thank honourable senators on both sides for their strong support of the legislation which, of course, the Government supports equally as strongly. During the debate some mention was made by Senator Grimes and in particular by Senator Archer when he referred to the problems of New Zealand competition in the berry industry, of the future closer economic relations negotiations with New Zealand. During the CER negotiations the Tasmanian industry in particular expressed concern at the significant increase in New Zealand berry fruit production in recent years and the potential for increased future exports to Australia.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The facts are that berry fruit and berry fruit products from New Zealand are already tariff free or are subject to minimal rates of duty. New Zealand has a 10 per cent tariff on imports of Australian berry fruit not containing added sugar and quantitative restrictions apply to Australian frozen berry fruit and fresh berries other than strawberries. New Zealand exports are subsidised under the Export Performance Taxation Incentives Scheme. Under CER these subsidies are to be cut in half in 1985 and eliminated in 1987. New Zealand's tariff on frozen berry fruit will be phased out by 1984. CER will, therefore, place the Australian industry in an improved competitive position in relation to imports from New Zealand and will provide it with an opportunity to increase exports to New Zealand. In the interim the CER arrangements provide for expedited anti- dumping and countervailing duty remedies if export subsidies are causing or threatening material injury to the Australian industry. Of course, there will also be recourse to the special Government industry liaison arrangements for horticultural products to enable the speedy determination of whether a legitimate complaint exists under the anti-dumping Act. The Australian berry fruit bounty arrangements will not be affected therefore by CER. In these circumstances I am firmly of the view that the Australian berry fruit industry will be in a more favourable position under CER than would have been the case if current trade arrangements were to continue. Nevertheless, it is necessary to acknowledge the points made by Senator Archer and Senator Watson in the course of the debate. It will be a matter for constant monitoring.

       As to the future of the industry generally, I think the Senate was very greatly enlightened by the informed remarks of our Tasmanian colleagues who are very closely associated with the industry.

        â€”This is the commencement of a very important debate because it is a debate dealing with Bills that raise very sensitive and very difficult questions. Not the least of those questions of course is the motivation of the Government in bringing this National Crimes Commission Bill forward at this time. Perhaps one of those motivations is the Government's desire to do something to rid itself of the embarrassment which has constantly been its lot so long as the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union continues to sit. Another motivation possibly is the desire of the Government to bring forward a good resounding law and order issue in time for a possible early election. But I do not think that much is to be gained and much purpose is to be served by continuing the gales of rhetoric that have attended so much of the earlier debate on this issue in the other chamber and elsewhere. I think it is time now that we got down to a fairly cool and reasoned analysis of the proposal before us and indeed treated it in the form in which it comes before us on its merits.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I think the issue is best approached in three parts by asking three quite different questions in succession. The first question is: Is there a need for some further and better investigative and law enforcement machinery to deal with organised crime in related areas? The second question is: If so, what is the best way of providing it? The alternatives in the debate are essentially three- fold; first, to upgrade the powers and capacity of the police; secondly, to continue the existence of ad hoc royal commissions, perhaps with some further expansion of their powers; and thirdly, to establish some form of permanent crimes commission. The third question is: If one comes down in favour in principle of the crimes commission mode as being the best of those three alternative approaches, is this particular Bill good enough?. Does it hit the target? Does it get the balance between community interests and individual rights accurate?
      </para>
      <para>
       If I may summarise briefly at this stage, the answers which the Australian Labor Party gives to those three questions are as follows: Firstly we say, on balance, yes; there is a need for some better investigative machinery in this area than presently exists. Secondly, we say, on balance, and after carefully considering the alternatives, that we support the crimes commission concept in preference to those other alternatives. Thirdly, in answer to the question relating to whether this Bill and the crimes commission provisions contained in it are good enough, we say no, we are not happy with this Bill. We will support it on the second reading because we think the concepts and the basic spirit lying behind it are supportable but we will actively seek to amend the Bill in a number of respects in the Committee stage. If we are unsuccessful in substance in securing those amendments we will then oppose the Bill at the third reading. I will have something more to say later on the question of whether we will support the reference of the Bill to a standing committee of this Senate. But that is one option that does suggest itself in the event that it appears that the amendments that we will be proposing are either unlikely to be accepted or are not accepted.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn now to consider in detail the three major questions that I previously identified, beginning with the question of need. The primary evidence of the need for some better investigative mechanism is the series of reports which have been made in recent years involving royal commissions, special company investigations and, occasionally, police task forces which have amply demonstrated that a large amount of organised crime is occurring, especially in the areas of drug trafficking, tax evasion and corporate crime, which involves a considerable measure of official corruption. Further, those reports appear to amply demonstrate that existing law enforcement machinery is not very good at pinning down that organised crime and securing the convictions of those reasonably believed to be involved. The kinds of reports I am referring to-it is perhaps worth listing them-going right back first of all to 1964 are: The Cusack report to the Victorian Government on murders at the Queen Victoria Market; then more recently, beginning the run of the more up to date reports, the Moffitt Royal Commission into Allegations of Organised Crime in Clubs in New South Wales in 1974; the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs in 1980-the Commonwealth body; and the Woodward Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking in 1979-80-the New South Wales exercise out of which arose the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking between 1980 and 1982, which task force investigated Nugan Hand Limited and others in terms recommended by that Woodward Report, which report was recently tabled in this Parliament. There was the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking which sat between 1981 and 1982 with jurisdiction conferred on it not only by the Commonwealth but also New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. There was the report of the other Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry involving not the New South Wales Mr Justice Woodward but the Federal Mr Justice Woodward in 1982-again a joint exercise, on this occasion between the Commonwealth and Victoria. There was the McCabe-Lafranchi Special Companies Act Investigation reporting in 1982 in Victoria and, of course, finally the ongoing Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which has been sitting since 1981 under commissions vested in it by the Commonwealth and Victoria.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not claim that all these reports are equally impressive demonstrations, either of the existence of serious organised crime or of the need for royal commission-type inquiries to deal with it. Indeed, I have been critical in the past of the shoddiness of some of these reports, in particular, it must be said, that of the New South Wales Mr Justice Woodward in his report on drug trafficking. Certainly it is the case that others, not I, have been critical of the accuracy of other aspects, for example, of the Costigan report. I also acknowledge that the need for some further and better machinery has been disputed by a number of commentators especially, for example, the Victorian barristers, Robert Richter and Jack Lazarus in the well-publicised forum on the proposed national crimes commission which was held at the Law Institute of Victoria on 15 September this year, both of whom talked of a miscellany of existing bodies and powers and of the real immediate need being not so much the creation of new bodies and powers, rather a better analysis or a better use of facts which, by and large, are already known or already available.
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to those comments, which received wide attention, I think it should be acknowledged that both speakers were talking in the shadow then of an unknown body which they I think anticipated as being rather more fearsome than the body which has finally emerged in legislative guise from the Government. So it may be that the argument under those whose circumstances was a little more coloured than it might otherwise have been. Certainly, however, the police are in no doubt that the existing weaponry against serious or organised crime is inadequate. While they have not, understandably, been quick to endorse the Costigan findings so far as the lack of personnel with 'appropriate intellectual ability and training' to undergo analysis is concerned, they certainly have been quick to support other aspects of the Costigan report findings. For example, I refer to the findings relating to the absence of sufficient appropriate equipment and, more pertinently even than that for present purposes, the absence of wide-ranging powers which Costigan argued to be necessary to get ready access to documentary evidence, especially taxation and banking records, and to engage in more exploratory searches and seizures than the law presently allows and, furthermore, to demand answers to questions in circumstances which the law does not now permit.
      </para>
      <para>
       When one weighs and balances all the claims and counter claims which are made about the need for further and better machinery in this area, the Opposition comes down, on balance, on the side of the proposition that the case has been made out both as to the existence of very significant levels of organised crime in this country and for the need for better investigative enforcement machinery to deal with it. The $64,000 question, however, now becomes: What kind of further and better machinery ought we to opt for? As I indicated previously, the options seem to reduce themselves basically to three-to upgrade the powers and capacity of the police; to continue the existing ad hoc pattern of royal commissions; and to establish some form of permanent crimes commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dealing firstly with the question of the police, this is, of course, the option which appeals most to the police, who have made a number of communications both directly to members of parliament and through the media to this effect. But equally it is a course which the Opposition quite strongly resists. While we have conceded in the past a case for additional police powers, for example in the area of wire tapping in relation to certain specifically defined serious drug offences-an issue which we have been debating on and off over the last three or four years-we simply are not prepared to give the police the kind of blank cheque search and interrogation power that Mr Rippon and a miscellany of other police spokesmen have been actively seeking in recent months.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reason for sensitivity on this subject is, I think, fairly evident. It is essentially the enormous coercive powers that are presently vested in the police ; their capacity actually to deprive people of their liberty by way of arrest or otherwise in the course of conducting investigations. We believe those powers should be able to be exercised, if at all, only in the context of the reasonable suspicion by the police of the commission of particular offences. They ought not to be allowed to be exercised by police officers possessing these coercive and liberty denying powers in the context of exploratory investigations of the kind that are necessarily involved when one is dealing with organised crime. Furthermore, there is a real difficulty in confining the powers, once granted in some limited context in the exercise, to a limited area. It has to be acknowledged, as we did in the debate on the drug crime issue and the question of electronic surveillance which there arose, that this is a practical problem in that it all too easily can come to be the case that powers granted for one purpose come to be exercised, de facto, across the whole range of police activity.
      </para>
      <para>
       We see the real need, with respect to police powers, as being not so much to expand those powers but to codify, to define precisely and in some, but by no means all respects, to limit those powers and to limit the way in which they can be exercised. But that is itself a long debate and one that can be better conducted in the context of the continuing argument about the criminal investigation Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are not saying in rejecting the vesting of more powers in the police in the area of organised crime investigation that the police have no role at all in the investigation of such crime. A strong case can be made, as Costigan acknowledges , for relying on police task forces to work very closely with the investigative officers of a commission. Especially is that desirable, I guess, when investigations involving the crossing of jurisdictional boundaries are concerned .
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, there is a strong case for engaging police, I would have thought, actively to carry out the on the ground investigation work rather than have those powers exercised-I am talking, for example, about executing search warrants-by non-police members of the staff of a royal commission. I say that because there does exist now in at least some jurisdictions, certainly including the Commonwealth, reasonably effective disciplinary measures for the misuse by the police of their statutory powers, disciplinary measures and proceedings which are not obviously readily available in the context of other people exercising these kinds of powers. Certainly, we would further acknowledge that a very good case can be made for ploughing further resources into the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and, furthermore, for upgrading significantly the analytical capacity, the data evaluation capacity, of the police forces, both in respect of personnel involved in these tasks and the equipment with which they operate. But we simply do not believe, to repeat, that the police are the appropriate front line agency for the new and more far reaching kind of investigative activity as contemplated in the context of this legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       What, then, of the second option, the continuation of ad hoc royal commissions? Certainly, royal commissions are already well endowed with powers under existing legislation, much of which such legislation has, of course, been in place right back to the turn of the century. Furthermore, the royal commission will have even more wide-ranging powers if the amending legislation that is part of this cognate debate goes through in its present form. Royal commissions have been, as the list I earlier read into the record indicates, the primary vehicles through which the whole recent run of organised crime investigations have been organised . We could clearly, as a nation, go on using this particular model. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party has been critical of attempts to wind up prematurely the Costigan Royal Commission as an exploratory investigative agency in this particular area, and certainly the Costigan Royal Commission, with its quite brilliantly innovative use of computer technology, its willingness to follow leads wherever they go, its ever expanding terms of reference, albeit much against the will of the Fraser Government, and its willingness to hand over evidentiary material to prosecutors rather than simply saving it up for final reports issued in a blaze of publicity shows, in my view, how successful an investigative agency in this area of organised crime, a traditionally organised royal commission, can be.
      </para>
      <para>
       But there are, nonetheless, a number of weaknesses in the traditional royal commission approach which I think ought to be identified. One is the problem of continuity. Clearly, there must be some limits on the extent to which the trail, starting, in the case of the Costigan report, with the painters and dockers, can go on winding. There must be some limits to the extent to which there can be an endless series of supplementary terms of reference, endless further appropriations, and so on. There comes a point at which it becomes clear that some less ad hoc body would, no doubt, be a more appropriate body to follow particular leads or to carry on tasks, a body with clearly defined jurisdiction and with appropriate accountability mechanisms, perhaps more satisfactory than those of the Costigan Royal Commission, involved in it. But that question of continuity apart, I believe that a much more serious weakness in the traditional royal commission model is from a civil liberties point of view. The basic problem here is that royal commissions are traditionally designed to expose what are described as true facts, rather than to operate as part of the law enforcement process. I acknowledge that the expression 'true facts' is sublimely tautological, but that does tend to be the phrase which is commonly used in this area. There are no statutory prohibitions of limitations on individuals being named, causing, of course, massive detriment to their reputations in the process in public hearings and in final reports. Traditionally there has been no right to refuse to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination, although such evidence has not traditionally been admissible against that person in any subsequent criminal or civil proceedings.
      </para>
      <para>
       The absence of privilege against self-incrimination in the context of royal commissions might make sense in the context of a commission inquiring into, for example, a cause of an air disaster but it seems to us to make none at all and certainly has no justification in principle in the context of an exercise designed to accumulate material satisfactorily to found criminal prosecutions. It is, furthermore, notorious that royal commissions, particularly those into aspects of organised crime, have been conspicuously unsuccessful in producing subsequent convictions, even though numerous individuals may have been named in its proceedings and report. This is damaging, in turn, not only of course to the individuals concerned but also to confidence in the system of justice. So all in all we take the view that the royal commission model can work in particular instances, as the Costigan Royal Commission appears to have done at least so far . But it is not well designed for the task of dealing with, investigating, exposing and accumulating evidence about organised crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       That then leads us necessarily to the remaining option, which is the establishment of an ongoing National Crimes Commission. The notion of a crimes commission is not a term of art. There are certainly as many different models and concepts around, in the United States as elsewhere, as there are bodies bearing that description. But I do not think it helps the cause of rational debate to go off on the basis of some notional model of what a crimes commission might be, if that may or may not have anything to do with the kind of body which is actually being floated here and now. What we need to do is to focus, in this debate, on the kind of body which has come forward in the proposal from the Government and to try to evaluate the merits of that proposal. In this respect I think it has to be acknowledged that there are several important differences between the present proposal and the traditional royal commission model which many criticisms, including those from the lawyers organisation, seem to me to have either largely ignored or understated. The most crucial of the differences is that the Crimes Commission, in the form in which it is now being proposed, exists not to expose directly true facts, so called, or individual wrong doing through the identification of individuals and proceedings and reports; rather it is to ferret out by various means, including the search and seizure of documents on judicial warrant, the analysis of documents, intelligence information, oral evidence and, through some limited inquisitorial processes, evidence which would otherwise remain inaccessible and then to hand it over to prosecution authorities for decision as to the initiation of proceedings and the conduct of those proceedings. There is provision-inadequate provision at the moment, in our view, but I will come to the details of that later if I have time-for hearings to be in private and there is indeed some statutory encouragement for this when reputations are at stake. In this particular model which has come forward there is also an express prohibition of the publication of the names of suspects in commission reports. Taking all the aspects of the basic model that is before us into account, the ALP is, albeit very cautiously, prepared to give the Bill a second reading on the basis of those provisions as they presently stand. That ALP support does not, however, imply in any way, and I make this absolutely clear, commitment to the details of the Government legislation which, as I foreshadowed, I will get to shortly.
      </para>
      <para>
       The basis for that support I think can be summarised very briefly by repeating, to some extent, what I have been saying so far. Our support is based on a belief , first of all, that the various royal commissions and other recent developments have demonstrated a need for more effective enforcement methods to be employed than hitherto. Secondly, it is based on the belief that the development of the necessary analytical skills within the existing police forces is likely, to put it politely, to be a prolonged and complicated process. Thirdly, it is based on a belief that if additional powers of any kind are to be exercised in this area it is safer on the whole for them to be exercised by some accountable body other than the police force which will, quite apart from any other consideration, be tempted to employ the powers in question right across the whole field of its activities. Finally, our position at the second reading stage is based on a belief that it is possible to devise appropriate safeguards in the detailed provisions of the legislation to ensure that neither a new star chamber nor a Frankenstein monster is in fact created.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to the present Bill and to the question whether it is in fact good enough in the form in which it presently stands. The Opposition sees this as being the crucial issue. We approach the Bill, I guess, from the outset from the perspective that any Bill which is vehemently opposed by, among others, Mr Russell Hinze, Mr Bill Hassell from Western Australia, Mr Tom Rippon of the Police Association and by the Law Institute of Victoria and Victorian Bar Council cannot be all bad. But nonetheless the Bill still has a number of substantial defects which I want to canvass very briefly in the short time available to me. A number of changes were made to the legislation in the House of Representatives to make it more palatable, including the removal of the obligation to produce self-incriminating documents. But not enough amendments were made to make it palatable to the Australian Labor Party. Accordingly, we opposed the Bill at the third reading stage which we will do again in the event that our proposed amendments are not substantially adopted. In the event that those amendments are not substantially adopted-let me spell it out again-or that it becomes clear in advance of the Committee stage of the debate that they will not be adopted the Opposition will move, at the appropriate time, for the reference of this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for detailed inquiry and report. It seems likely at this stage that one way or another the numbers will be found in this chamber to ensure that result.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of the 10 amendments that we propose to move, seven are aimed at correcting matters which were adversely commented upon by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its 18th report. I will list the most important of those amendments. They are those designed, in the first place, to limit strictly the categories of offences which may be investigated to those involving organised crime, sophisticated techniques or official corruption. The trouble with the present clause 7 is that it is much too wide-ranging. It gives credence to fears about the use of the Commission as a vehicle for a renewed bout of Macarthyist hearings in this country. Secondly, our amendments will be designed to remove the power to seize material which is not properly identified in a search warrant. Thirdly, our amendments will be designed to remove the protection which is available under the law of defamation for reports of public hearings of the Commission. This appears to us to be the only practical way, short of requiring compulsorily all Commission proceedings to be in private, of ensuring that reputation destroying hearsay evidence of the kind which is not admissible in ordinary court proceedings is not given wide currency. Our amendments will be further designed to remove the additional coercive powers which now appear in clause 18 of the Bill which could result in a recalcitrant witness not just being punished by six months gaol or a $1,000 fine but also by open-ended gaoling for contempt of court. We will further be seeking to narrow the contempt of Commission prohibition to disruptive behaviour of the kind which would, in other forums, constitute contempt in the face of the court. Finally, in this list of the more substantial of our amendments, we will be seeking to reduce the terms of commissioners to two years as distinct from the present proposed five years, renewable once only so that there is a regular turnover at the top and to reduce the prospects of the Commission developing an unaccountable life of its own.
      </para>
      <para>
       In summarising the objections to the Crimes Commission model that has come forward, it is evident that they come from three basic sources. I have dealt with the objections from the police. I think the civil libertarian objections will be accommodated if the amendments that I have foreshadowed are adopted. That leaves only the objections which have been rather noisily mounted by the States. No doubt they will be equally noisily mounted by those States righters we hear so much from in this chamber. The Labor Party's position is simply this: Provided the Commission continues to work in co-operation with joint police task forces and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and that the States eventually show themselves prepared to refer authority in those few areas where the Commission will be unable to investigate fully a matter without it, we do not see formal Federal-State co-operation from the outset as being a necessary condition for the usefulness of the body. Indeed, one of the most alarming aspects of the originally floated proposals was that they involved just that-a system of joint accountability through a ministerial council which we believe would, in practice, mean a body effectively accountable politically to no one.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is not time for me to say very much about the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 1982. I will have to wait until the Committee stage of the Bill. I simply indicate that the Opposition, despite a number of aspects of this Bill which have generated a degree of controversy, will not oppose it. We accept the explanation of the self-incrimination provision which is contained in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and which will, no doubt, be the subject of Committee stage discussion. We do, however, oppose those aspects of the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill which raise the same points as those in issue in the National Crimes Commission legislation. Indeed our objections to things like the search warrant power and the imprisonment for contempt power are stronger in this case because of the very different character of royal commissions and the proposed National Crimes Commission.

        â€”I rise to support the second reading of the National Crimes Commission Bill 1982 and the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 1982. I indicate that I am in general support of the Government's propositions that it should set up a National Crimes Commission and strengthen the powers which royal commissioners have. As I will indicate in my speech, I have certain considerable reservations about some of the provisions of the Bill. I have listened with interest to what Senator Evans has said on behalf of the Opposition. I find very little that one can challenge in the criticisms that he made and the general proposition he put forward for establishing the need for such a body in this country. I think it is important in the first place to say that I consider that there has been inadequate discussion of these Bills among Government senators. The way in which hurried decisions have been made about the Bills and decisions delayed about whether there ought to be amendments is a matter of some concern to me. It puts me in a particularly awkward position. I received this morning a bulk of material relating to the matter. In my capacity as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills I have not had the opportunity to be given advice from the counsel that advises that Committee. I expect to be much more informed about that situation and about the extent to which the Government's responses to our criticisms are satisfactory by tomorrow morning.

        â€”I understand that. I am very relieved to know that. There is obvious need for further discussion about the terms of this Bill. I think it is important though to deal with the general propositions contained in this Bill. It is useful to outline the purposes of the two Bills because I think they tend to be forgotten in some of the criticisms that are made. The National Crimes Commission Bill sets up a body which has the function of investigating organised crime and official corruption with a view to prosecution action where appropriate. The Government further maintains that while the Bill provides for investigation by the Commission of breaches of Commonwealth law, provision is also made for participating States to give the Commision functions relating to the investigation of offences against State law. Criticism can be made of the Bill in that it relates, of course, essentially to Commonwealth law. But, as is said, it gives the States the opportunity to participate in this course of action.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The other purposes of the Bill are, of course, the investigation of offences and the assembly of evidence with a view to prosecution. The Commission may also be authorised to conduct investigations of a more general character and nature relating to criminal activity and to make reports and recommendations thereon to government. The Bill gives the Commission important powers necessary to its functions. However these powers are made subject to appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals. Whether the safeguards are appropriate is the subject of very considerable discussion by a number of groups in the community, including law bodies, civil libertarian bodies and individuals who are concerned that rights under the law should not be abandoned.

       The second Bill which we are dealing with in this cognate debate amends the Royal Commissions Act. The principal amendments to that Act are made to provide that those royal commissions whose letters patent so provide are to have certain additional powers. Firstly, there is to be the power to issue certificates that witnesses have refused or failed to comply with certain requirements. Where such a certificate is given the Federal Court or a Supreme Court may, on the application of the Attorney-General, inquire into the case and order the person to comply with the requirement. Secondly, the Commission may apply to a judge of a prescribed court for the issue of a search warrant where, among other things, it believes a thing connected with a matter in respect of which it is conducting an inquiry might be concealed or destroyed if a summons were issued for its production. In circumstances of urgency an application for a search warrant may be made by telephone. That was an amendment which was added, I think at the suggestion of the Opposition, in the House of Representatives.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other major amendments made by the Bill deal with the privilege against self- incrimination, extend the power to issue summonses to require the production of non-documentary material and provide protection to counsel assisting or appearing before the Commission. Royal commissions will also be empowered to communicate information that relates to or may relate to the commission of an offence or afford evidence of the commission of an offence to various Commonwealth and State authorities. Provision is also made for functions or powers conferred by State authorities under State laws upon the Commission to be performed or exercised in conjunction with the performance of its functions or powers under the Royal Commissions Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is important that we appreciate the scope of these two Acts. They have quite a lot in common; indeed they have some problems in common. Senator Evans has made out what I believe is a sound case for the establishment of a national crimes commission and he has investigated the alternatives that have been suggested. In particular I refer to the idea that it would be sufficient to increase the investigatory powers of present law enforcement bodies. I do not think that this answers the problem, particularly in relation to organised crime in this community. I accept the fact that it is established that a very substantial degree of organised crime seems to be beyond the power, and perhaps in some cases even the will, of enforcement bodies in the various States. I believe that the public of this community is calling for action which will be at least as efficient as organised crime bodies which, of course, operate willy- nilly across State boundaries and are not in anyway restricted by federalism.

        â€”There is a most extraordinary conglomeration of commissions in the United States. Some are private and some are formed for quite specific purposes. I believe that the proposed commission would be more efficient. We have had the example of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which is sometimes criticised but to my mind it is doing a very substantial and important job in this community. That is a royal commission. However, one could imagine that a national crimes commission operating in a similar way would turn up many things and provide evidence for prosecutions which otherwise would not be obtained by State bodies. So far as the case for a crimes commission is concerned, Senator Evans referred to the number of bodies which have pointed out over many years the deficiencies of existing organisations dealing with organised crime. I do not propose to repeat the names of those various commissions but I do want to refer to a couple of remarks which have been made by royal commissioners, in particular the Williams Royal Commission on Drugs in 1980. The Commissioner had this to say about the alternative to law enforcement agencies:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Law enforcement regards its functions as discharged once the individual is arrested and charged in respect of a particular offence. To say these things is not to criticise law enforcement agencies in the performance of their duties. The criminal law in Australia is ill equipped to deal with any 'organised basis' of illegal activities-establishing the 'organised basis' will have no consequence so far as the law is concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore I think we must recognise that something over and above the existing law enforcement agencies is needed. More recently the Costigan Royal Commission, in its interim report No. 4, set out a number of reasons which show there is a need for something of this nature. In particular, I think it is important to recognise the following comment made in the report about existing law enforcement agencies:
      </para>
      <para>
       They do not have sufficient personnel of the appropriate intellectual capability and training to undertake that difficult analysis of facts which is necessary to identify major criminal organisations. In part I believe this is attributable to a reluctance by police forces to recruit graduates from Universities directly into their criminal investigation branches. The reluctance springs out of fierce opposition to recruitment at officer level. The opposition is difficult to justify, particularly when one takes into account that it has been the practice in the military forces for a very long time. The opposition will have to be defeated if police forces are to have available to them in sufficient numbers men of the appropriate intellectual calibre to match those who are in the criminal organisation. It is sufficient to draw attention to the academic qualifications of . . . to make the point that the criminal organisations do not suffer from the same disadvantage.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also pointed out that at present State police forces are not properly equipped to do these things and also that they lack power and are confined to traditional methods which have not made them successful in achieving these results. I believe that there is a strong case for a crimes commission in this country. But it is important that we consider the details of that crimes commission and that we do not abandon at the same time the rights of individuals in this community which have taken hundreds of years to accumulate and which are still essential to them. We must not be panicked into removing those rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the things that has been raised in criticism of the proposed body is the fact that it will be purely a Commonwealth body. I know that negotiations have taken place with the States and I am sorry that after a long time they have not come to the party in reaching agreement on this matter. I hope that they will take up the options in this Bill which make it possible for them to co-operate. Even if a number of States co-operate that in itself will be very valuable. It is my belief that when one creates a crimes commission of this nature it is not a matter of interfering with some essential State powers. We are dealing here with a hiatus of State powers; we are dealing here with all the grey areas. People engaged in criminal conspiracy and with unlimited money are able to run roughshod over the weaknesses of limited State organisations. I hope that the Commission will be seen in that light by the States and not in the light of providing some sort of objection to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       We must recognise that in recent years there has been undoubted corruption in some State police forces. Unquestionably, even at a high level, there have been persons who have not pursued the fight against organised crime. I believe that some of the objection that comes from police bodies relates to a desire not to have interference in their internal affairs. Perhaps it may highlight activities and lead to some embarrassment. I do not say that in a general way about the police forces of this country but I believe that to some extent there is that fear. Some of the corruption that has been revealed by various royal commissions around the States-royal commissions which one need not enumerate but which are probably very close to our minds-concerns the failure of the police to observe proper standards of conduct. These are matters that indicate that we cannot rely entirely on the police forces of the States to achieve the necessary and desirable results.
      </para>
      <para>
       While this debate has been going on there has been some strong criticism, particularly by legal bodies, of the proposed Crimes Commission. In the early stages I think some of the criticism was a little demented and excessive. I believe, as I think Senator Evans does, that when the protections that are written into the Bill are seen, some of the earlier comments which suggested that we might be returning to the days of the Stuarts or star chambers will prove unjustified. At the same time we must be careful that there is no ground for such criticism. One of the big concerns has been about whether such a commission will meet openly or secretly. The Bill provides that the Commission may sit in secret. In many cases I think that is desirable to protect reputations and secrets which people properly have. It also provides that their wishes shall be taken into account. Of course, those wishes may be overridden.

        â€”Yes, it is a very difficult thing to reach an accommodation in this area. Consequently, I think the more discussion we have about this the better to try to ensure that we do not overbalance it. It is true that this Bill provides for a five-year term. I think, the Australian Labor Party wants a two- year term. Assuming the appointment is for a limited period nonetheless great damage could be done to individuals in that time if we are not careful. I think we must carefully test the balance between secrecy and openness in regard to the investigation of people, because many of these investigations will be fishing expeditions. Royal commissions have a fixed term of reference. The Crimes Commission may find itself turning-as the Costigan Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union found-its inquiry into different and surprising areas. Of course people called before the Commission will be examined in different ways.

        â€”Yes, I see. Some of the concerns expressed by the law bodies perhaps deserve more consideration than they have been given. There have been discussions in regard to self-incrimination and the difference which existed between the production of documents and persons being required to give individual evidence that might be incriminating. There have been changes. I understand that the Government will be moving a further amendment in this area. From my reading of it, it seems to me to have some common sense about it. I would like to see the details of it. The law bodies are concerned that a person called before the Commission might not know of the area in which he is to be examined.

       I note that the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) in his response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills pointed out that the principal target of investigation-that is, the person likely to be charged-should not be questioned. When the examination is commenced, very often it will be difficult to say who that will finish up being. Of course, such a person who has to come before the Commission and decide whether he requires counsel does not know whether he will be asked to give information merely of some use-in which case he need not expend a great deal of money on counsel-or whether he will be questioned on the basis of malicious information given to the inquiry which would totally embarass him publicly. The open-ended nature of this matter and the fact that people who are asked to appear get no knowledge beforehand are serious concerns of the legal bodies. They have not been answered yet.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Labor Party's foreshadowed amendments to the Bill raise a number of concerns. I think one needs to look carefully at them. I certainly will do so before determining how I will vote on them at the Committee stage. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee in its eighteenth report-Senator Evans has already referred to this-set out a considerable number of problems. I stress again that the Committee highlights matters that are referred to it. It does not form concluded views. It raised certain matters some weeks ago. As of this morning I had received a response from the Acting Attorney-General on matters relating to both Bills. That response went to our counsel, Professor Pearce, this morning. I hope that tomorrow morning the Committee will have a chance to discuss and settle a report, which should be presented here by tomorrow afternoon. That will set out the ministerial response and will say in which areas that response satisfactorily answers the queries raised and nominate those areas which are still open for serious consideration by the Senate. In that way we might be able to narrow the source of dispute which could arise. As honourable senators will see, the time factor here is very short. Therefore, it is made very difficult for me, as Chairman of that Committee, to go into details of criticism. That criticism covers such matters as the functions of the Commission, search warrants, the provision for passport seizure, hearings and their openness, the problems relating to a spouse who may be called to give evidence, and false and misleading evidence which is raised an which can be an offence before the Commission. It also covers contempt and secrecy provisions. These matters need to be considered seriously by us in Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Scrutiny of Bills Committee likewise has reported its concerns about the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill. The Government was concerned with what is known as the Hammond case. That is a case in which the High Court of Australia ruled that a royal commissioner could not ask a person already on charges questions which might incriminate him. The High Court left open the question of whether, if that person were not on charges, those questions might be asked. The Government is resolving this by requiring such a person to answer if no charges are in existence. I think that has to be carefully considered in the light of the long history of British law.

In this case not only did the Opposition perform well but also Mr John Spender and a number of other Government members moved amendments, some of which were accepted. I think the Bill was truly improved by the amendments. However, I am certainly not happy about one of the amendments which was rejected by the other place. That was an amendment in regard to costs. I propose to move the same amendment as that moved by Mr John Spender in the other place in respect of the provision of costs and where the Commission thinks it is suitable that person appearing before the Commission should be awarded costs. I believe that if people are expected to do their public duty, to spend their time appearing before the Commission and to employ counsel they should be able to recover their costs. It is not to be conluded that all the people who come before the Commission will be crooks, rogues and vagabonds. Of course they will not; many will be worthy citizens expected to spend days appearing there. I will say more about this when the amendment is debated.

       The other amendments are in the melting pot. Discussions about these amendments by Government members will take place as late as this evening. Of course, the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills will meet in the morning. I believe we must overcome some of the problems that have arisen in this legislation because of the hurried way in which it has been formulated and brought before the Parliament and because of the limited time in which members of the Parliament have had the opportunity to consider it to date. On the other hand, I believe that this proposed Crimes Commission is a very necessary institution which the Parliament should have. I am, therefore, not happy to see a delay in the implementation of the legislation. I hope that the Government will look very carefully at the legislation and accept some of the more essential amendments proposed by senators from various parts of the chamber. If this is not done then I am afraid that insofar as concern has been expressed about the maintenance of the rights of Australian citizens we may have to look at the Bill further and a little more slowly. I hope that in the next 24 hours there will be a continuing, searching and worrying look at the provisions in the two Bills to make sure that they are adequate and do not wipe out the progress, success and glory of the provisions that protect individuals in the community. I support the second readings of both Bills and hope that, with some amendments, they will have a successful passage.

        â€”There is no doubt that the state and extent of organised crime in this country are such that there has to be a response of some sort to the growing problem that obviously exists. But the Opposition, correctly I believe, poses the question whether the establishment of a National Crimes Commission is a totally adequate and correct response. We need to say that because we have some doubts about whether the Government, in proposing the National Crimes Commission has really grasped the nettle in respect of organised crime in this country. The establishment of a similar organisation in the United States of America, for example, has not, in any way, shape or form, resolved the problem of criminality at the top levels of society which has been paramount in that country for most of this century. In fact, evidence is certainly available to show that the more the industrialised countries develop and the more capitalist economies develop, the greater the extent of corruption, unfortunately at the top. It does not matter whether it is the United States, Japan, Italy, West Germany or now Australia; there is this phenomenon of the development of white collar crime and a growing incidence of this sort of activity. I think it flows from the fact that the value system upon which we base our society is one that believes that making or accumulating money is the most important feature. While that value system operates there will be probably tens of thousands of people in this country prepared to engage in activities that enrich them at the expense of others. Nowhere does this legislation attack that aspect of criminality.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It does not matter what royal commissions we establish or what evidence is available, there is a growing incidence of people attempting to accumulate money at the expense of others. After all, when this Government established the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to look at waterfront crime the Commission finished up considering crime at the top level. It finished up considering tax evasion which was being carried on by wealthy sections of the community. Last week and in preceding weeks 23 senators-I think the largest number of senators to be involved in a debate in more recent years-took part in a debate on taxation legislation, justifying or criticising the legislation. That legislation was about white collar crime and wholesale tax evasion by people with assets who wanted to evade their responsibilities. I put them in the same category as those who rob organisations to which they belong such as the financial institutions and the houses of commerce. I put them in the same category as drug runners, bank robbers and employers stealing from their organisations which has been so much a feature of recent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The growth of white collar crime has been alluded to consistently by people involved in the investigation of crime in our community. I recall statements made almost annually by people such as Mr Clifford, the Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology, who pointed out growing incidences of white collar crime in Australia. What is this Government's attitude to it? It is the establishment of yet another bureacracy. I think there is enough evidence to indicate that some of the existing bureaucracies have been penetrated by the criminal element. It has penetrated various law enforcement agencies and other agencies established by this Government such as the Narcotics Bureau, sections of our police forces and other agencies. Under the guise of protecting the community from crime people have been able to penetrate and infiltrate those organisations and carry on their nefarious activities.

       We have to accept the fact that within our society there is wholesale corruption which occurs mostly in the white collar area. It occurs in professional groups who see nothing wrong with evading their tax responsibilities and who spend their time with accountants and lawyers who advise them how to avoid their tax responsibilities. This has become evident by the consistent appointment, at both Commonwealth and State level, of royal commissions. The Commonwealth- New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking has investigated the problem of drugs in Australia and how it has penetrated our business community. I see no evidence to show that drug trafficking has penetrated the trade unions, the working class centres. Certainly, there is abundant evidence that it has penetrated the business community. Consequently, that Task Force has had the herculean task of attempting to obtain evidence of the degree of involvement of officials in the drug running that has taken place in this country. The Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, the Stewart Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking and the Costigan Royal Commission have pointed out the inadequacy of skilled staff and resources to combat white collar crime. So whose responsibility is it if it is not the Commonwealth Government's responsibility to make sure that there are adequate trained and skilled personnel to fight this evil that exists in our society? The establishment of another organisation to do this will not necessarily resolve the problem. Will the establishment of another bureaucracy give us the skilled personnel referred to by Mr Costigan and other royal commissioners? In my State of New South Wales we have had the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking, investigating a degree of organised crime in that State.
      </para>
      <para>
       In respect of each of those royal commissions, one has to say that governments have fallen down on their tasks. Without exception in every case governments have been asked, subsequent to the establishment of the royal commissions, to extend their terms of reference. Why was it not done in the first place? Why was there such reticence? Why did we have such terms of reference that put constraints upon the investigations into the subject matter of those royal commissions? It is suggested that by the establishment of a National Crimes Commission the problem will be resolved. This is in the face of opposition from all of the States. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Everingham, said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The impression is that everyone's at it, one way or another.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is probably overemphasising it to say that everybody is at it. Plenty of people in the Australian community are not attempting to amass money and fortunes by acts of criminality. Nevertheless, because people highly placed in our society are at it, one gets the impression that everybody is. Mr Everingham went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       Public servants are running escort agencies, doctors are burning the midnight oil falsifying Medibank claims. The professional accountant is in league with the lawyer building whole business empires in the murky depths of various harbours.
      </para>

       It is clear that Police Forces across Australia need greater powers to investigate, and bring before the courts, people whose activities have only been revealed by the lengthy and expensive procedures of Commissions of Inquiry.
      </para>

       These revelations lead us to ask what is wrong with our criminal justice system when it apparently allows serious crime at the highest and best organised levels to go undetected by normal investigation procedures.

       That raises a very important point. If we look at the speeches made by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, and by Mr Lionel Bowen on behalf of the Australian Labour Party, we see that Mr Newman admitted what we have been asserting-that is, Mr Hayden, Mr Bowen and I-in respect of Nugan Hand. It was involved in drug running and gun running. I will quote from what Mr Newman said when he presented the report of the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking. I quote from House of Representatives Hansard page 2857 of 9 November. Mr Newman said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The report contains compelling evidence that Nugan Hand, in its many manifestations, paid little regard to the laws of the land and engaged in illegal and criminal activities. In particular, it knowingly laundered and moved money internationally for drug traffickers.
      </para>
      <para>
       What was the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation doing while these sorts of activities were being carried out by the Nugan Hand organisation? It was more concerned with whether Arthur Gietzelt was talking to a member of the Socialist Workers Party, a National Civic Council member or a member of the Communist Party in some pub or other, following proper legal political activities, instead of really carrying out its task of investigating criminality taking place in this country. Mr Newman, the Minister for Administrative Services, who introduced this Bill in the House of Representatives, dealt with the activities of that organisation and with the activities of the Joint Task Force that was established in co-operation between the Australian Government and the Government of New South Wales to look into drug running and all of its manifestations. Some of the reports are so hot that they have not even been tabled or made available. Mr Newman admits that these illegal transactions occurred. What is the Reserve Bank of Australia doing? Where are the people in the community whose responsibility it is to protect us from these nefarious and subversive activities? What are they doing? We have seen a drastic increase in the amount of money given to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I have only to look at my colleague Senator Mulvihill to remember how he, together with Senator Murphy and others, was involved with activities of that organisation and the Ustashi affair during the period of the Whitlam Government. That organisation fell down on its job. It has fallen down on its job in respect of white collar crime in Australia. The defence and the security of this country is about white collar crime-drug running, gun running and other subversive activities involving currency transactions in and out of Australia. As Mr Bowen pointed out, ASIO was used to bring in dubious characters from the United States who had intelligence links in Australia with the Central Intelligence Agency--

Yet these very dubious characters, whose records should have been known by our departments and certainly by our intelligence organisations, were given not only citizenship rights but also rights to move in and out of this country without a passport and without the normal restrictions imposed on ordinary citizens. As Mr Bowen pointed out, the first report of the Joint Task Force had to be kept confidential. I note that the Government is now saying that the matters which are the subject of the present report will be the terms of reference for the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking under Mr Justice Stewart. Mr Bowen went on to point out that it is necessary to expand the terms of reference to include the actions of international intelligence agencies and particularly those people who have been named in this report and elsewhere as being associated with those intelligence agencies.

        â€”It was given to government agencies, to government agents. I mention also Mr Volkman who came to me and who subsequently I put on to Mr Bowen , who dealt with his case in great detail in the House of Representatives. Mr Volkman gave evidence in camera and then received a visit from the Australian Federal Police at which they took his notes. He was subsequently forced into a position where he lost his job with a Commonwealth agency and found himself persecuted by our Attorney-General (Senator Durack). He was forced to go into the supreme court to defend his good name when he was framed in respect of a so- called transfer out of Australia of protected species of birds. When the matter went to the court the judge laughed it out of court. Nevertheless, this gentleman gave evidence because he believed that intelligence forces were involved in white collar crime. It was part of his duty as a member of the Narcotics Bureau. He has been persecuted ever since he gave that evidence and he stood to lose not only his job but also substantial sums of money in trying to protect his good name. Naturally the Australian Labor Party is concerned about the civil liberties involved in this question of a National Crimes Commission. If one dares to go before a National Crimes Commission to expose the obvious degree of corruption that is at the top level of our society one must protect not only one's good name but also one's life. Let us have no bones about it at all. Knights of the realm are involved in this activity. They come and go at their pleasure because the agencies in this country turn a blind eye to their activities. Because they have a handle to their names they are looked at with less suspicion than ordinary citizens who-as we saw in the report of the Commissioner of Taxation-were prosecuted and fined for their couple of thousand dollars worth of tax evasion, whereas the big fish not only got away with it but also in some respects were defended by people in high places.

       I have been somewhat surprised at the extent of representations that have come to us over the last month or so since the Government made its decision, in defiance of the State Attorneys-General. Every State Attorney-General or chief officer has expressed reservations about the legislation and said that it is not adequate, that the existing law enforcement agencies are adequate to carry out the task. Those representations have come from police associations, whose integrity I am prepared to accept even though I think there are a few rotten apples in some of the police organisations and the agencies, but one does not throw the baby out with the bath water. When we receive representations from legal associations, lawyers societies and police associations expressing reservations and when there is a unanimous view that the States do not believe the establishment of this organisation is the answer to the problem, then we are entitled to ask: Why is it that the Government has sought headlines in respect of this but not been prepared to give the sort of backup assistance to the existing law enforcement agencies which could carry out the task if they were given adequate resources?

      <para>
       We are concerned about the right of the individual, who probably does transgress at some stage but then realises the enormity of that transgression and seeks to redress the misdeed and to give evidence. One is not confident that this legislation will protect that person. I believe somewhere between 30 and 40 investigators from the corporate affairs commissions in both Victoria and New South Wales are continually investigating white collar crime. Those bodies, and the personnel in them, are looking at the corporate criminals and the people who are using their positions in society to enrich themselves at the expense of their fellow persons. Where is our similar organisation? Are we suggesting that the National Crimes Commission can fulfil that function? What sort of co- ordination have we got? It has been suggested to me by some of the Attorneys- General that we have inadequate organisation, co-ordination and resources to carry out the task that is at hand.

       As was indicated we will be moving a range of amendments which seek to protect the right of the individual and to take into account criticisms that have been made by the States and by some of the persons concerned with fighting crime and those who are concerned about the civil liberty aspect. I heard Senator Missen suggest in his contribution that the Government take on board sufficient of those amendments to allay our concern about the civil liberty aspects and about the weaknesses that exist within the legislation. If they are not accepted in the spirit of which the amendments have been put the Opposition will find itself having to vote against the third reading, not in an expression of obstruction, which is the favourite word that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) uses if the Senate exercises any powers of revision or review of legislation, but because we genuinely believe that the proposals that are embodied in this legislation are not adequate to deal with the problem. There is nothing in the legislation about the recommendations of the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union or the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking which constantly refers or alludes to a lack of human resources and funds and the inadequacy of the existing agencies because of Commonwealth government policy with regard to fighting criminality and organised crime in this country.

       During the hearing of an Estimates committee I asked the Deputy Superintendent of the Australian Federal Police, whether the Police had adequate resources to deal with the Medibank fraud or other frauds that were taking place. He was interrupted by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle who answered in the affirmative and said that the Police did have adequate resources. Now that flies in the face of all the evidence available to us that the Commonwealth Government, in its inane and insane desire to reduce public sector spending, is removing and reducing the capacity of our law enforcement agencies to operate in the area of fighting organised crime in this country. It is because we do not believe in the sincerity of this Government that we have grave misgivings about the legislation .

       While I am on my feet I will refer to another of our agencies which concerns me , as it did Mr Clyde Cameron, a Minister in the Labor Government. I am talking again about one of our own intelligence organisations which also ought to have been involved in the detection of white collar crime and intelligence gathering and the operation and transfer of large sums of finance in and out of this country. I refer to the Australian Security Intelligence Service, which Mr Cameron exposed because of its activities in our embassy in Santiago during the period of the Allende Government. Evidence has been produced in the last few days which indicates that when the Allende Government became aware of the subversive activities of the Criminal Intelligence Agency in Chile during its period in office-I emphasise that that government was a democratically elected government-the Australian Security Intelligence Service, without the consent of the Australian Government, was used as a centre for carrying out the activities that led to the downfall and the overthrow of the elected government.

       So, some of those people ought to be put on trial in respect of these matters; we should not be just establishing some sort of gimmicky organisation that sounds good for those who do not really examine what the organisation is really about. It sounds nice, clean and correct to establish a National Crimes Commission in the belief that it will solve this problem whereas in fact, of course, I and many of my party colleagues believe that some of those people in those organisations and agencies which operate on behalf of a government have turned a blind eye, and in so doing are protecting the very evil of criminality which is rampant in so many of the countries in the Western world. To our everlasting discredit governments do not pay sufficient attention to the detail of cleaning out this cancer which exists within our society. It is a cancer that will weaken the democratic fabric of our society unless governments have the courage and guts to get on with the job of fighting organised crime.

        â€”As a result of the existence of organised crime in Australia as revealed by various royal commissions, task forces and investigatory bodies, the Commonwealth has proposed a National Crimes Commission to investigate organised crime. There is very little doubt that with the increasing sophistication with which crime is being carried out, particularly in that area which is commonly known these days as white collar crime, it is necessary for law enforcement agencies charged with investigating these crimes to be given the best possible environment in which to operate. A National Crimes Commission would have three fundamental features which would create the right environment. It would have certain powers which are not available to other agencies or jurisdictions. It would be able to attract, as a result of the funds which it would have, the very best personnel with the requisite expertise to deal with sophisticated crime and it would have access to the very best equipment to enable detailed intelligence gathering analysis of the type which we have seen in the Costigan Report into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth has two vital assets in this area. It has the power to give to the National Crimes Commission certain rights which are not available to other agencies. Of course, it has the funds to finance the ever-increasing cost of sophisticated criminal investigations. While these assets are to be employed to fight against organised crime they are not in themselves, in my view, sufficient to ensure that the contest is successful. The Commonwealth must ensure that it has the co-operation and the active participation of the States and State criminal investigation agencies whose task it is to enforce the great bulk of our criminal laws. The Commonwealth cannot go it alone on this matter, if it genuinely expects to combat organised crime effectively. By the manner in which the National Crimes Commission Bill has been presented and prepared and by the manner in which it seeks to establish the National Crimes Commission which would operate under the terms of this Bill, it is quite clear that support from the States will not be forthcoming.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is very important to consider the sequence of events which led to the introduction of this Bill. On 20 August this year a meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council first considered the Commonwealth Government's proposal for a National Crimes Commission. The proposal was not in the form in which this legislation seeks to set up the Commission, but nevertheless it was similar to that which is being proposed. Without exception, every State and the Northern Territory rejected the proposals which were then based on the model of the United States Crimes Commission. At that meeting in Canberra a working party was set up which consisted of representatives of the Commonwealth Government, the Western Australian Government and the New South Wales Government. Those two State governments were virtually delegated to represent the other States in the working party. The resolution of the Australian Police Ministers Council meeting of 20 August acknowledged the existence of organised crime in Australia. The resolution stated that the Commonwealth's proposal was 'one possible option to be considered'. The resolution also acknowledged:
      </para>
      <para>
       A second option advanced by Western Australia might be to upgrade and further develop the ABCI-
      </para>
      <para>
       That is, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence-
      </para>
      <para>
       including established links with operational law enforcement agencies throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 24 September there was a combined police Ministers and Attorneys-General meeting. That meeting examined the proposals of the working party that had been prepared until that stage. The meeting asked the Australian Police Ministers Council to refine further the proposals for the multi-jurisdictional course of action-that is, a proposal involving some upgrading of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence with more emphasis on task forces to combat crime. It must be emphasised that at that point the Commonwealth was party to those proceedings and was represented on the working party. Without going into excessive detail, it was agreed that the working party would report after further refinement of its proposal by 5 November to the Police Ministers Council and to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. At that point the Commonwealth was still a member of the working party and of those subsequent committees.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the very day that the National Crimes Commission Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives a meeting was taking place in Adelaide of senior officers of the various police forces. Those officers were putting the final touches to the working party's proposal to present to the Standing Committee. On that very day, 21 October, the Commonwealth introduced this Bill even as the working party was putting its final touches to the proposal. At that point an endeavour was being made to reach consensus amongst the States in Australia and the Commonwealth. On that very day senior police officers would have looked at the final proposal at a joint meeting and would have been ready to submit it, as arranged and agreed, on 5 November to the meeting of police Ministers in Melbourne. The proposal, was considerably different from that which is embodied in the present legislation which I shall seek to demonstrate later. But even at the time the Commonwealth was participating in the working party-for all we know it was drawing on the information that it was learning from the working party-it was surreptitiously drafting the legislation which we have before us today, in the form which the States have repeatedly, month after month, rejected and said is not acceptable to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question that should be asked is why the working party's plan was not considered as it had been originally intended and arranged. If the Commonwealth had already decided that the plan was not to its liking-of course, it already knew the proposal because it was a party to the developments-why was not at least the form of 20 August adhered to? The States were delivered a fait accompli. The Commonwealth, which has only limited jurisdiction over criminal matters, has presented the States which, under the Constitution, have control over the greater part of criminal activity, with a National Crimes Commission which will run largely according to its original model with the States simply tagging along. There are indications that if the States do not approve or agree, it is just too bad; the Commonwealth will go along without them. There are indications that the Commonwealth believes that with the money it has to finance this national anti-crime body and with its sole power to authorise certain investigatory proceeding, such as telephone taps, access to taxation records, and the opening of mail, the States have no option but to join in with the National Crimes Commission in the form which the Commonwealth Government wants.

        â€”We will not do it. Nevertheless, there are several objections to the Commission as this legislation would establish it which do not ensure that the States will go along. As I have said already, all the States, including the Northern Territory, have opposed the establishment of a permanent crimes commission. They contend that there is no justification for creating a new investigatory body such as the National Crimes Commission and for such a body having a judicial function. There is no justification for the creation of a new police force, albeit seconded from the Commonwealth, State and Territory police forces, which will duplicate the investigative roles of the existing agencies.

       The Commonwealth is following the United States example. When its crimes commission was first established similar justification was given at that time. It had to do with the fact that the United States Government had to involve itself in matters which transcended consideration of the States concerned. The havens for organised crime such as prostitution and gambling, with the exception , perhaps, of the importation and exportation of drugs, are matters which come within the State jurisdictions. What is proposed by this legislation is that the Commonwealth, in its jurisdiction, will come in over the top of the States' jurisdiction and do many of the things which are presently being done. In my view, that is totally unacceptable. The States and the Australian Federal Police have set up a joint task force to deal with crime where it transcends State boundaries. They have been very successful. The more notable inquiries have been the Royal Commission into the Builders Labourers Federation, the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry and the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union.

Where they have included the Commonwealth they have on occasions been granted some of the powers which are exclusively vested in the Commonwealth and will be vested with the National Crimes Commission. I refer the Senate to the Commonwealth Government's paper on the National Crimes Commission issued by the Attorney- General, Senator Durack, in August which states:

      </para>

       The last of these powers is embodied in this Bill. The first was recommended especially by Commissioner Costigan. The second is already being used by the Australian Federal Police in investigations into drug-related matters, either alone or in a task force situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The police in Western Australia have been seeking for some time now, quite unrelated to this legislation, the same rights and privileges the Commonwealth has in respect of telephone interception-they have been doing so quite independently of the considerations which brought forward this National Crimes Commission-as a necessary extension of the tools already available to them in the fight against organised crime. They have argued, quite rightly, that it is absolutely ludicrous that only the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Bureau of Customs have, and can obtain, these powers when the bulk of criminal jurisdiction is conducted by the States. Without the participation of the States the Commission which this Bill seeks to estabish will not have jurisdiction to carry out the functions for which it is designed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The alternative, which has been supported by all the States, is to give the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence the right to seek from the appropriate authorities the sorts of investigative powers outlined by Senator Durack in his August paper. The ABCI was established by agreement in February 1981 following suggestions contained in the reports of the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking and the Williams Royal Commission into Drugs specifically to fight organised crime. The structure is already there and is capable of being further upgraded and developed. All the Commissioners of Police are on the Board of Control of the ABCI. Their function is to identify from within their jurisdiction appropriate targets for investigation. They are, after all, presumably in the best position to identify areas of criminal activity most in need of attention. The ABCI then gathers the information for the jurisdictions, either acting individually or as part of a task force. I believe that that is the most logical and the only practical way in which the targets can be determined. This therefore leads one to ask: If the States opt not to participate in the Commonwealth Crimes Commission, how can this Commission expect to identify the appropriate targets in the first place? The Crimes Commission would not have access to ABCI information and without the agreement of all those participating in the ABCI it could never gain access to it. Yet, as I have said, it is the one body in Australia which is ideally suited to identify targets for investigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I return to the point I raised earlier. Because of the ABCI's particular unique relationship to all the jurisdictions in Australia, the advantages it has over the proposed National Crimes Commission and its relationship to other joint Commonwealth-State-police arrangements, such as the National Police Research Unit and the proposed national institute of forensic science, it is the logical body to boost these additional powers. To fight organised crime the police need the money to counter sophisticated developments in crime and the power to carry out these investigations. There is nothing complicated about that. One needs money for the right personnel and the right equipment. One needs the power to gain access to important information sources which hitherto have been denied the State jurisdictions. What is implied in this Bill and the manner in which it has been introduced, pre-empting proposals which were put forward on 5 November by that working party and the Government's recognition that any such body needs wider investigative powers, is that the only way the States can get these powers and the necessary funds is to join the Commonwealth National Crimes Commission. If the States were to do so they would be creating an anomalous situation in respect of the Constitution by giving to the Commonwealth, through its National Crimes Commission, jurisdiction over criminal matters which the Constitution left in the hands of the States.

        â€”That is right. Without State participation the National Crimes Commission needs the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence to function in a broad domestic sense. Agreement for that will not be forthcoming from participants in the agreement which set up the ABCI. That was clear from the reactions of the Western Australian Minister for Police, the Queensland Minister for Justice and, indeed, the Australian Federal Police Association. The comments of the Secretary of that body are particularly appropriate here. Mr Curtin, when asked about the National Crimes Commission, stated:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       While it may reveal organised crime in Australia, what happens afterwards? It has to go back to the police. It seems it's duplication of the judicial system.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, that is exactly what it is. It is a duplication of what is already in place, which needs only some upgrading and strengthening to do what is intended to be done by this legislation. Within the agreement by which the ABCI was set up there was scope for it to be broadened, particularly in respect of its field operations. Presently it does not have an operational wing. It is purely an intelligence gathering body that relies on information being fed into it by the Commonwealth, State and Territory police forces. It then disseminates that information to various jurisdictions. It could of course, be broadened to give it an operational wing and it would then do precisely what the National Crimes Commission is intended to do. But of course it would have the States' support. The structure would be very different in one way-it would have the support of all the States.
      </para>
      <para>
       The legislation before us today would create a commission which is a Federal commission answerable to the Federal Attorney-General. To operate effectively it needs the States to cede their jurisdiction so that both the Commonwealth and the States have jurisdiction over general criminal matters. Without exception, the States and the Northern Territory have said that they do not want a Commonwealth crimes commission. In accordance with agreements on these matters which are already in operation and by which co-operative interstate arrangements have functioned for the last two years, they want a combined body. They are seeking a commission, a task force, or whatever we like to call it that belongs to all governments, just as the ABCI belongs to all of its participants, just as the national research body belongs to all governments and just as the new Australian Police College and the Institute of Forensic Science will belong to all governments equally. In my view, they are proof of the success of co- operative arrangements operating under the auspices of the Australian Police Ministers Council. No one government, State or Federal, has control over these bodies that have arisen out of these joint arrangements. Similarly, with the proposed upgrading of the ABCI, nobody would have control over it and it would be guaranteed its independence and freedom of action so that it would be seen to be beyond political control. As it is proposed, the National Crimes Commission will have the power to initiate investigations of its own volition or at the behest of the Federal Attorney-General or the Attorney-General of a participating State. But the Federal Attorney-General alone, under this legislation, may, and I quote from clause 12 of the Bill:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . give direction or furnish guidelines to the Commission, including directions or guidelines with respect to the priority to be accorded by the Commission to particular investigations or classes of investigations . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       By that power the Commonwealth alone would have the ability to deter the Commission from certain investigations on the pretext of a greater urgency with respect to another matter. I put this forward as a hypothetical proposition. It may be that the real intent of any government to deter a crimes commission from a particular source of activity is to ensure that it does not uncover something and cause that government embarrassment. I put it to the Senate that that limitation on the scope of action of the Commission as it is proposed by this legislation, and under the original proposal of the States for an upgraded ABCI run jointly by all its participants, could not occur. It could not occur because the likelihood of collusion amongst all participants to deter the Commission from one particular investigation is so remote as almost to be quite impossible.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the time remaining to me I should like to direct my remarks briefly towards the working paper which was being developed by the Australian Police Ministers Council and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I have indicated and I remain convinced, and I understand that the States remain convinced, that the best way to tackle organised crime is through an upgraded ABCI. However, at the meeting on 20 August it became apparent that the Commonwealth would not accept anything less than some sort of commission structure. Therefore, having regard to the political realities of the day, the working party set about reconciling the States' views with the Commonwealth's requirements. As a result, the working party produced a form of upgraded ABCI to be responsible to the Police Ministers of each State and of the Commonwealth, either directly through a ministerial crime council or an intermediate office attached to the Australian Police Ministers Council. In this way the Police Ministers would be able to discharge their normal functions across the broad spectrum of law enforcement with the added assurance of co-ordinated advice available to them from the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. Of course, the task forces attached to the ABCI to give it an operational wing would have the investigative powers necessary for this upgraded structure to be effective. The real departure from the original State notion was a special joint commission concept. Under this concept, special commissions would be set up with the existing powers of royal commissions, including the power to subpena witnesses and documents, the enabling powers which I have already mentioned, and the power to deal with contempt and to compel witnesses to co-operate. These commissions would have joint jurisdiction, multi-disciplined support units drawn from police officers, supplemented as necessary by Crown law officers, accountants, forensic scientists, tax experts or whoever was considered necessary to assist the commissions' inquiries.
      </para>
      <para>
       But there would have been three crucial differences between this proposal and that which is embodied in the legislation before the Senate today. In effect, these three differences summarise why the States are all objecting to the National Crimes Commission proposal as it has been put forward by the Federal Government. First, it would have been a joint effort, jointly run and it would have been required to report to all participating governments. Secondly, it would have its jurisdiction by virtue of its participants being equally involved in the running of the commissions and would, therefore, not offend against the proper division of powers as laid down by the Constitution. Finally, and most importantly-this covers one of the most serious objections which the States and the Northern Territory had to the Commonwealth's original proposal-it would not have been a standing royal commission-type structure but rather one that was brought into being as the need arose.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is also one crucial operational difference between the two proposals; that is, that the special joint commissions would refer matters to normal courts to prosecute. Again, as a concession to the Commonwealth, it was agreed that prosecutors could be used as consultants and, in particular cases, prosecutors could work with the special joint commission with a view ultimately to undertaking the prosecution. The proposal in this legislation is for the prosecutor to be an integral part of the Crimes Commission appointed under the recently enacted Special Prosecutors Act to handle prosecutions arising from the Commission's operations. The tradition that there is a need to preserve the integrity of the prosecutors by keeping them distinct from the investigation process in my view has not been taken into account.
      </para>
      <para>
       In my view the proposal before us is not a good one. The manner in which it has come before us, in an apparent breach of an undertaking given at the Australian Police Ministers Council, leads one to have initial doubts about the legislation . The fact that the proposal ignores virtually all the objections unanimously raised by the States and the Northern Territory which have both had jurisdiction and vast experience in criminal investigation matters has led to very serious deficiencies. I am not sure those deficiencies will be overcome. I have serious reservations about the immediacy, the urgency, of this legislation. The fact is that by 5 November this year there should have been a complete, comprehensive and presumably co-ordinated report presented by all States, the Territory and the Commonwealth to the satisfaction of all. Now we find that this legislation is rushed through the House of Representatives and the Government is now seeking to rush it through the Senate.

I think we recognise the need for an effective Crimes Commission-one that embraces all jurisdictions, one that has the capacity to go beyond Commonwealth legislation which is very limited in terms of its scope relating to criminal matters and one which has good will and co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. Perhaps in the minds of honourable senators opposite this is a unique occasion on which there was good will, good endeavour and good intent, and good progress was being made towards ensuring that the States and the Commonwealth finally came up with a model that satisfied everybody.

       I think it is a misnomer to name this body the National Crimes Commission. Of course it is not. It is a Commonwealth crimes commission and it is intended to bulldoze the States, by the methods I have outlined, into falling into line. I suspect that they will not. If the participants of the original 1981 agreement- the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence-decline to provide this Commission with the repository of the knowledge that body has gathered over the years I think the Commission is going to be a damp squib. The only way that I can see without that goodwill that information being made available is through the insidious leaking of that information from the Australian Federal Police. I find it very regrettable, when it is vital that we have the right legislation to embrace all jurisdictions for the purpose of fighting national crime which is becoming-to use somebody else's expression-almost of epidemic proportions, that we now have legislation rushed through the chamber which deals in a very limited , imprecise and inadequate way with national crime.

       I have not made up my mind where my position will finally be when the Bill is put to the vote but it would give me a great deal of comfort if I thought that the Government had the common sense, the wisdom, the will and the good will to defer this legislation until such time as there have been further proper, meaningful negotiations with State governments, particularly given the good will that the State governments and the Territories have offered.

        â€”Senator Crichton-Browne has given a short history of the relationship between the present Federal Government and the States in relation to the creation of this National Crimes Commission. Unfortunately, as he has outlined, he has the misfortune to give his allegiance to a government which is arrogant and contemptuous in its disregard for the States and the proper consultation processes that should have been undertaken. I agree with that. It appears, from what Senator Crichton-Browne has told this chamber, that for some months the national Government cloaked its real intentions whilst keeping the States running around in working parties thinking they were achieving some concensus, certainly at the officials level.

        â€”And even at the ministerial level. I have some sympathy with the concern that Senator Crichton-Browne expressed but I do not think that that should obscure what merits there are in this legislation. I know that Senator Crichton-Browne has not made up his mind on this legislation. I hope that he admits at the end of the debate that there is sufficient good in the National Crimes Commission Bill, which is designed to establish a National Crimes Commission to investigate criminal activities-in particular organised criminal activities-with a view to prosecution of offenders, to merit his support. I believe that it does merit the support of the whole chamber; not uncritical support but general support. I believe there is no doubt that there is a need for a nation-wide mechanism to challenge what is a nation-wide problem.

       No one can seriously doubt that Australia is experiencing a type of criminal activity, a range of criminal activity, which is very skillfully organised. No one would expect that criminal activity to have regard to, to be curtailed or hindered by, State boundaries. There is no reason why in response the community should feel it ought to be hindered or restricted by reference to institutions, whether of police investigation or law enforcement activities, which grew up from colonial and then State developments. The tentacles of organised crime are national and this Parliament needs to respond in the face of evident failure of existing police investigation and law enforcement authorities. They have failed. They have an institutional framework based largely on State boundaries. They have not countered the upsurge in crime. Something new is needed and many and various royal commissions have pointed to that need. Senator Arthur Gietzelt's speech was a full listing, a very efficacious listing, of those reports, the constant theme being that some national mechanism was needed to counter national organised crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a fact that whilst in the Bill there is a proposal for a National Crimes Commission, State police forces and State law enforcement authorities will not be supplanted; they will be supplemented. Indeed, I believe that the Federal- State police task forces and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence can be strengthened. Indeed it can be noted that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his second reading speech undertook that further resources would be provided to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. That is to be welcomed. There is no reason to suppose that those arrangements cannot be strengthened. Certainly there is no reason to suppose that this legislation will supplant them. In fact a cursory reading of the Bill indicates the intention that the highest degree of co-operation ought to obtain between the National Crimes Commission and the States. Thus, clause 11 of the Bill states:
      </para>
      <para>
       In performing its functions the Commission shall-
      </para>
      <para>
       The wording is 'shall' not 'may'; this is a direction from the Parliament--
      </para>
      <para>
       so far as practicable, work in co-operation with the Australian Federal Police and the Police Forces of the States and any other authorities or persons responsible for the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth or of the States .
      </para>
      <para>
       The Parliament, if it passes the Bill, intends as a mandatory direction that the National Crimes Commission seek co-operation with the State police forces. As Senator Crichton-Browne pointed out, it is true that the States are encouraged to use the facilities and organisation provided by the National Crimes Commission. Thus, clause 8 reads:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the Commission shall perform any functions in relation to the investigation of an offence or offences, however described or referred to, against the laws of a State that are conferred upon it by or under any law of the State.

        â€”No, far from it. I will come to that in a moment. A State parliament could pass a law conferring jurisdiction on the National Crimes Commission. I believe that will occur as the State communities, their police forces, their law enforcement agencies, their governments and their populations, gather in confidence concerning the functions of the National Crimes Commission. It is not to be forgotten that whilst it is true that State police commissioners and law enforcement officers now have some misgivings about the creation of a National Crimes Commission I understand that the idea was first put forward by Victoria's Chief Commissioner of Police, Mr Miller. He saw it as a means of tackling organised crime in Australia. As I said, he first floated the idea. I do not believe the motion is without support at the highest levels of the police and law enforcement authorities. I concede that the manner of its being brought into this Parliament is a reflection perhaps of the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). As I said, that ought not to obscure the merits of the Bill and the fact that in its terms it is directed to allowing a co- operative growth with State law enforcement authorities in order to tackle organised crime.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Let us not forget the primary functions of the National Crimes Commission. It is true that it is limited to investigating circumstances suggesting an offence against a Commonwealth law or a law of a Territory. That is its primary jurisdictional boundary. Thus one would be able to deal with the importing of drugs or criminal conspiracy to defraud the revenue or social security, or something like that. What it is designed to do is to enable a full attack to be mounted against organised criminal activities; that is, offences that appear to be connected with one another and involving several offenders and substantial planning and organisation. It is required to look at tackling offences involving the use of sophisticated methods, planning or techniques. Finally it is directed to have regard to activities relating to bribery or corruption involving officers of the Commonwealth or of a Territory. There its primary jurisdiction is laid out.
      </para>
      <para>
       We do have something before us which is innovative. Basically it is inquisitorial with very wide investigative powers. It is continuous and it has non-specific terms of reference. The jurisdiction I have outlined is really its terms of reference. It is true that directions and guidelines can be given to the Commission by the Federal Attorney-General. I think that the misgivings that Senator Crichton-Browne had about that clause may be laid somewhat at rest by a fuller reading of the clause. The honourable senator read that part which states :
      </para>
      <para>
       The Attorney-General may, by notice in writing to the Commission, give directions or furnish guidelines to the Commission, including directions or guidelines with respect to the priority to be accorded by the Commission to particular investigations or classes of investigations but the Attorney-General is not entitled to give directions or furnish guidelines in relation to the conduct of a particular investigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The point that Senator Crichton-Browne made remains: By asserting that perhaps the importing of drugs has priority over the investigation of fraud in relation to the Commonwealth revenue, the Federal Attorney-General might thereby effectively remove resources away from an area which, for some reason, he may not want to pursue vigorously or robustly. But clause 12 (2) continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       Where the Attorney-General gives any directions . . . the Attorney-General shall cause a copy of the directions or guidlines to be published in the Gazette .
      </para>
      <para>
       These are not secret guidelines. They are written guidelines published is the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. Therefore, they will be immediately exposed to public observation and criticism if necessary and certainly will be exposed to the critique which may be offered by those in this chamber who might wish to bring them forward at Question Time or in fuller debate. Once again, if the States decide to come into the National Crimes Commission framework and use the facilities which will be available, the Federal Attorney-General cannot establish a priority which puts a State matter, given to the Commission by the State, at the botton of the list without the consent of the State Minister concerned. In all those ways I think that there is some protection against the sort of abuse which Senator Crichton-Browne rightly alerted us to. But, as I said, the innovation in the creation of the National Crimes Commission would be the substantial investigative powers that it would be given. I have already outlined that its substantial jurisdiction is to investigate any circumstances suggesting that an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth may have occurred.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not true to say that this Bill creates a royal commission with a five- year term. The whole direction of the National Crimes Commission is towards prosecutions whereas royal commissions are fact finding exercises on the whole. They have been notoriously inept even when they have suggested that prosecutions should be undertaken against certain persons whom they have named specifically in their reports. It has been a well known fact that very few prosecutions have succeeded because royal commissions have not been concerned to gather and assemble that level of evidence which would satisfy a court.

No doubt, in those instances, a special prosecutor would undertake the assessment of the evidence and the prosecution that might be required. But there is no doubt that in this role of investigation , with all of the resources and facilities available to it, and in assembling evidence, always mindful of the need to assemble such evidence as might lead to successful prosecution, we have quite an innovation on the Australian scene in our desire to combat organised crime. There are some dangers. It is true to say that the Opposition has had as many misgivings as others. We will seek to ensure at the Committee stage that certain basic liberties are not put at risk, that reputations are not wrongfully or needlessly destroyed and that the Commission is fully accountable to the democratic political process. But I think we should freely concede in this chamber that the Government has already made certain clarifications, concessions and modifications in the course of the public and parliamentary debate. To that extent I believe that, insofar as it has so responded, the Commonwealth Government deserves some praise.

       When one looks at some of the differences between the proposed National Crimes Commission and the traditional forms of royal commissions, we find that in this Bill the Crimes Commission is given the discretion to conduct its hearings in private. Of course, this will be entirely appropriate where there is a possibility of prejudice to the ultimate fair trial of a person. Hearings will be conducted in private where there is a danger that the reputation of a person may be needlessly destroyed or that a fair trial at an ultimate future date might be prejudiced.

      <para>
       In relation to self incrimination, which I know is a concern of many honourable senators, there is a substantial meeting of many of the criticisms that were originally levelled at the concept as it was then known. Now a person appearing as a witness before a commission is not entitled, without reasonable excuse, to refuse or to fail to answer a question that he is required to answer by the member presiding at the hearing. Further, he may not refuse or fail to produce a document that he is summoned to produce. But it is a reasonable excuse that to answer the question might tend to incriminate. So where a person alleges that to answer a question or to produce a document might incriminate him, the Bill states that he is entitled to silence; he need not answer unless the Attorney has guaranteed his immunity from prosecution in relation to that point. In that way we have a reasonable response by the Government to the misgivings that many people have. Further, in its public reports the Commission is enjoined and required not to identify the identity of a particular person if to reveal that identity might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or the fair trial of a person who has been charged with an offence.

       So in many ways the Government has already moved a long way to satisfy those who had misgivings about some of the civil liberty aspects which were under some threat by this Bill. As I said, this Bill represents an innovation in our public life. It is not surprising that it has taken some public and parliamentary debate to refine the Bill. There is still room for something that Senator Crichton-Browne pleaded for so eloquently. There is still room for the Government to make a further amendment which would permit us to vote for the third reading of the Bill. Whilst the Opposition will support the Bill in principle at the second reading stage, it will press amendments which it thinks may further protect individuals why may be caught up in this process before the National Crimes Commission. If those amendments are not substantially accepted by the Government, we will reluctantly have to oppose the Bill at the third reading. But there is still time for negotiation.
      </para>
      <para>
       For those who have serious and genuine doubts about the establishment of such a commission I think clause 39 (1) of the Bill can be of some solace. That clause reads:
      </para>
      <para>
       This Act, unless sooner repealed, shall cease to be in force at the expiration of 5 years after the date of the commencement of the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       So there it is very clear. The fact is that this Parliament, the House of Representatives and the Senate-the two chambers-will have to re-create the National Crimes Commission in five years time if it is to continue. It will naturally expire five years from the date of commencement of the Act. So there will be deliberate debate in both chambers on whether to reinstitute the Commission. As I say, we will have to revive it with legislation passed through this Parliament.

        â€”I think even a good Catholic would have to concede that after 1, 982 years the Sermon on the Mount has really not penetrated the social mores. I think another five years is probably too short a space of time to expect it to succeed completely. Within those five years Senator Crichton-Browne's misgivings might prove to be misplaced. That period will give the States, their police forces, their law enforcement agencies and their Attorneys-General time to observe the operations of the Commission, to co-operate with it and to give it references from time to time. Over those five years I believe some confidence might be built up. It would be wrong to deny to the nation this innovation, this new weapon within our institutional armoury to fight organised crime. This chamber ought not to deprive the community of this weapon. The National Crimes Commission ought to be permitted to accumulate experience, expertise, and the trust and confidence of the police and law enforcement authorities of the States and the Northern Territory. Naturally they are cautious, but I believe that natural caution can be overcome. In fact I believe the five-year clause gives the National Crimes Commission and the Federal Attorney-General every incentive to make sure that trust and confidence are created over the five years between now and the lapse of this legislation. But it would be a foolish, a short- sighted and hidebound Parliament which with all the protection we can afford to those who might appear before the Commission's investigations and furthering and assembling of evidence for prosecution, would deny the National Crimes Commission a five-year term of existence to help the nation fight-I repeat this- its jurisdiction. This is what we are setting up this Commission for and this is why the Labour Party supports in principle the creation of a commission. Clause 7 states that the commission shall direct its activities in relation to organised criminal activities, offences involving the use of sophisticated methods, planning or techniques; or relating to bribery or corruption involving officers of the Commonwealth or of a Territory. I believe that this is a bold experiment. It can be refined a little further at the Committee stage, but on the whole it deserves our support.

        â€”What is the purpose of the National Crimes Commission Bill? The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in his second reading speech said:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       . . . to establish a body . . . the National Crimes Commission which will be given the functions and powers necessary to deal with forms of crime with which existing law enforcement bodies have difficulty in coping.
      </para>
      <para>
       What are these forms of crime? From a Press release from the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack) in July of this year and from the substance of the Bill it appears that the activities to which this Commission would be directed are, first, organised crime and, secondly, corruption of officials and official bodies. It is interesting and somewhat surprising that the latter-the corruption of officials and official bodies-received no mention in the Minister's second reading speech. It would appear that it is now being down played. The Senate will recall that back in April much of the impetus for a National Crimes Commission was apparent official corruption. There were particular allegations of police corruption. Allegations were also made of political corruption. It was suggested that a crimes commission of this nature was the best way of testing such allegations. Perhaps the media saw it in the spirit of the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans which claims the ouster of three judges, a police chief and the indictment of an assistant district attorney, a sheriff and a large number of policemen.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the revelations of the McCabe-Lafranchi report, and more particularly the Costigan report, have moved the emphasis not surprisingly to organised crime . What is organised crime? There are many definitions, but it is usually accepted to be a crime of a serious nature involving a number of persons utilising sophisticated techniques and methods. Warnings have been received of its nature and growth. The Senate will recall the Moffitt Royal Commission into Organised Crime in Clubs, the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking, the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-I have mentioned the interim reports-and the interim report of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. What is the present position? Costigan said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I am satisfied that the criminal organisation which is described in this report is flourishing in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the position in which we must approach the Bill which is before us. What is organised crime? It includes the major rackets with their base in prostitution, narcotics, pornography, loan sharking, gambling, starting price betting, casinos, organised labour, extortion and fraud. Also it may include theft, distribution of stolen property, credit card operations, housing and land swindles and white collar crime. It is said that white collar crime in the United States costs $40 billion a year. Obviously that is a cost to the total community either directly or indirectly. I have no figure for Australia but I can remind the Senate that crime prevention, according to the latest report of the Australian Institute of Criminology is said to be costing in excess of $1, 800m a year. Who are the criminals? Costigan says that they are those who supply the capital necessary for criminal enterprise-the financiers; those who provide the sophisticated services; members of professions who are prepared to deviate from professional codes of ethics; the criminal entrepreneurs who put the schemes together and, finally, the criminals who execute the schemes. In the Costigan report they are referred to in the following terms:
      </para>
      <para>
       They may be called upon to man the hotels as SP bookmakers, to distribute drugs , or fire the gun, or use the cosh. It is they who move the containers, or remove from them the contraband, or bribe and corrupt.
      </para>
      <para>
       These operatives are more easily identified and convicted by orthodox police methods-that is, complaint, investigation, arrest trial and conviction. But the leaders, the entrepreneurs, the professionals-lawyers, accountants, bankers, computer experts, et cetera-using modern rapid communications and sophisticated techniques are rarely identified and even less often convicted. There is no doubt that organised crime must be suppressed. I agree with Costigan when he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The unchecked operation of large scale criminal activity of a kind described in this report can lead only to a breakdown in law and order and the eventual destruction of the society in which we live.
      </para>
      <para>
       The evidence of this is that we are failing in Australia. I have referred to various royal commission reports of recent times which indicate that such is the case. The onus therefore is on governments to examine their law enforcement agencies. Can they be made more effective or is twentieth century organised crime of such a nature that it requires a new approach, new methodology? The Commonwealth has decided in this instance on a new approach-a new approach necessary to supplement the existing system-that is, the National Crimes Commission. However, I ask: What are the deficiencies in the existing system? Why is it necessary to look to the development of a new system rather than the conventional?
      </para>
      <para>
       Law enforcement in Australia is diffused, principally divided into six States, one Territory and the Federal police forces, each with limited jurisdiction and responsible to different political masters. The jurisdictions are not only divided geographically but also enforce separate criminal codes. In addition there are numerous other enforcement bodies-the Bureau of Customs, the Australian Taxation Office and the Corporate Affairs Office, to name just a few. The problems arising out of these somewhat artificial divisions are not easily overcome. To talk of a national police force with State divisions enforcing a national criminal code would, no doubt, displease many of my friends, notwithstanding its obvious merit. In addition to the problem of divisions in jurisdiction there are also the shortcomings of conventional police forces with the lack of sophisticated equipment and perhaps an insufficiently trained man force in the areas of accounting, finance and corporate law. I do not place great weight on those factors because clearly they can be overcome. However, what has become apparent more than anything else is a lack of power effectively to investigate organised crime. The proposed National Crimes Commission is really born out of the need for greater power-in particular, the power to compel evidence on oath as part of an investigation; a means of breaking the wall of silence so often faced by investigators of organised crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, that immediately raises questions of civil liberties. Inquisitorial methods of investigation cause concern. This Parliament has a responsibility for the security of society. It also has a responsibility to protect the fundamental rights and liberties of the average Australian citizen. However, there is provision for protection against self-incrimination in this National Crimes Commission Bill. In fact it has been extended beyond that under existing law to include production of documents. People's reputations are protected. The Commission cannot name in public reports people who are suspected of committing criminal activities. It cannot publish a Hoods Who, as in the case of the Chicago Crimes Commission and as has been planned by one of New York's crimes commissions. This, of course, would be abhorrent to our system. It is also not to be a citizens' vigilante group, which is the guise under which a number of the American crimes commissions operate. Debate such as this, of course, raises questions of civil liberties. But to a large extent I am satisfied that under this Bill the problems have been overcome. Some areas of remaining concern will be dealt with in the Committee stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       In recent times royal commissions have been successful in using inquisitorial power in the investigation of organised crime. Its value has also been shown in the case of corporate investigations. Therefore, with greater protection for the individual-and of course greater protection is necessary because the primary purpose of the proposed National Crimes Commission is to inquire into areas of criminal activity with a view to prosecution, whereas for a royal commission it is to make reports to government-it is an armament of the investigator which appears to be justified in all the unfortunate circumstances of expanding organised crime in this country.

         â€”I rise tonight at the behest of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia. That union has been involved in work on various construction and other kindred industries since the turn of the century. I think it is fitting that I should refer to documents given to me by that union, of which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has copies. A few days ago Senator MacGibbon referred to what he regarded as trade union feather bedding. The honourable senator forgot, in his comments, that members of unions such as the FEDFA work in desolate areas and some of the penalties and concessions are awarded because of the ardous work involved.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to refer to documents that emanated from a meeting of a large number of rank and file numbers of the FEDFA and the Australian Workers Union in the Australian Capital Territory who felt it was time that they exposed some of the shortcomings, rorts if we like, used by employers generally in dealing with the present Federal Government. I first of all ask that the documents that were handed to me by a senior officer of the FEDFA, David Crease, be incorporated in Hansard.
       </para>

       <para>
        On the 5th November, 1982, the F.E.D. &amp; F.A.-with the A.W.U.-held a combined meeting of members employed in the Public Service in Canberra. The meeting was held at the Canberra Workers Club. There, around 900 members of both Unions met together in the common interest concerning Job Security and the erosion of their numbers by Private Contractors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past 2 years the escalation of contractors invading work areas, traditionally covered by the Public Service employees, has been dramatic. Not only are the Departments encouraging these contractors; but, they are ignoring their responsibilities towards policing these contracts and ensuring that the contractor's employees are receiving the correct rates and conditions as per the appropriate Award-handed down by the Conciliation and Arbitration Courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also came to light, at this meeting, that Government material and labour was given to these contractors to help them fulfill their obligations to the Departments. Even to the extent that showers, towels, lockers and ablution facilities were given to them; tools and garages were supplied for the repair of Private Vehicles.
       </para>
       <para>
        That the tax-payer should be made aware of where his money is being spent. Money that pays for the running of Bureaucracy's blind administrators! Does the Public of Canberra know that contractors have, and over periods of years, been occupying houses of the Department of the Capital Territory for around $19.00 per week? (Even if you had a Government House and were on the 'Dole'-you couldn' t get a rebate that would match the 'Perks' of some contractors!).

        Government's Laws are ignored by Multi-nationals. Companies take the jobs with 'money in hand' payments-not only do the firms receive cheap labour by this method-but, are unpoliced by the Government.

       </para>
       <para>
        It has become more prevalent, in the present economic climate, than ever before -by these unscrupulous employers. Not only are the 'Fly-by-night' operators taking advantage, but, Multi-national Companies are exploiting this illegal, immoral practice. I feel that an article I wrote for the F.E.D. &amp; F.A. 'Operator ' would clearly emphasize the types of operations which have taken, and are taking, place. I, therefore, take the liberty of including it in this article for the 'Engine Driver'.
       </para>
       <para>
        EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS
       </para>
       <para>
        Especially since the down-turn in work, unscrupulous employers have exploited the situation. The F.E.D. &amp; F.A. has been fighting for conditions, wages and justice for their members, against these employers. In the main, it has been ' Fly-by-night' employers who have been feathering their own nests on the sweat of operators.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would take several chapters to expose just the conditions that they have been working under. No protection from the elements in reference to: toilets, sheds, travel allowance, NO sick leave, holiday pay or 38 hour week provision, etc. etc., the list could go on and on. It is no good complaining to the Unions when the promises of these scallywag shysters don't eventuate. It sounds good to be told: ''We can give you a job but, because of the Industrial down-turn, we have had to tender for the job for next to nothing-but we'll pay your $8-$10 per hour flat rate''. Note: No penalty rates, sickness provision, No compensation, etc., AND no tax-NO TAX. . . .GREAT you think!-BUT, wait until the TAXMAN calls. . . .AND MAN DOES HE CALL. . . . .!
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred, earlier, that the main exploiters were small 'Fly-by-night' operators, but, it has come to the attention of the Union that a large Multi- national Company-P.D.C. Constructions, a division of White Industries-has used this method to P.D.C. Constructions N.T., again a division of White Industries, have taken operators from around Australia to the Northern Territory. There, they were informed that they would be working for $9.50 per hour flat rate. They worked most times a 12 hour shift even night shift, 6 days a week. Though P.D.C. owned all the plant on the construction site, and is registered as an employer, they contracted the work force. The conditions that they have to give their work force, where the F.E.D. &amp; F.A. are constantly checking, far exceeds those in the N.T.
       </para>
       <para>
        White Industries are tendering for large constructions jobs within the A.C.T. The situation, in the N.T., would not be attempted here or anywhere else because of the Union's activity. There is no excuse for a large company, or anyone else for that matter, exploiting the worker such as this. One of the provisions in their contract, that was given to them, was (7) 'The Company will make payments to you on a fortnightly basis under your construction name'. This smells of: '' Say your construction name might not be your correct name for taxation purposes' '.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, operators who gave their correct names have been caught since for payments of $9500.00 to $17000.00 in tax. Please note the penalty for failure to pay your taxes as quoted from the A.C.T. Supreme Court:-
       </para>
       <para>
        ''In terms of A.C.T. Supreme Court interest at the rate of 10% per annum will accrue on such amounts from the date judgment is entered until final payment is made. Failure to pay could and generally does involve the following processes:

       </para>
       <para>
        If you are working for money in hand, or a flat rate, you are cheating yourselves out of thousands of dollars. For, rest assured, your smiling boss, who takes you to the Pub and shouts you a few beers, is filling his pockets with your money. Money that should be going to the support of your family-not his. The person that has to pay the 'piper' with the taxman is you. You will be kicked in the proverbial arse, by the same boss that shouts you beer (with your money). As soon as you are sick, hurt ON THE JOB, the job comes to an end, or, you feel that you need a holiday, his tax returns etc., the list is unending.

         â€”The documents could probably be summarised under a number of headings. The union claims that government contractors are circumventing conditions. That is a rather broad term. I should say that White Industries Ltd and some of its subsidiaries are mentioned. Some of the complaints would relate to the Northern Territory authorities; others of course would be under the control of the Industrial Relations Bureau. I simply say that that is a facet of this aid memorandum that perhaps the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Macphee, could look at. Secondly there is an allegation that in the Australian Capital Territory certain government offices, amenities, tools etc. have been provided for private contractors, and contracts seem to be obscure as to whether there will be any deduction for the utilisation of government facilities. On the question of the utilisation of government property , I would not be too sure of the line of demarcation between the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), but it is quite obvious that two areas are involved and I would expect both Ministers to make minute examinations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The other area is more sinister. It refers to the firm I mentioned earlier, White Industries Ltd, and whether it is using a form of income tax deduction by enticing employees to take cash in hand, and if this is so it is a matter of one for the employee and two for the boss. It is not merely a facet in the allegations made. There are certain pockets of industry where people are succumbing to this sort of thing. The payment is often well below the award rate . It does not cover things such as sick leave. From the state of the nation and the crusade that the Treasurer, Mr Howard, has mounted, I think attention should be brought to it. As honourable senators opposite know, I have defended John Howard in debates over the last fortnight. I do not envy his job. But I say that White Industries Ltd and its subsidiaries and the line it is taking with some of its employees who have been gulled into it, are denying the nation its proper return on income tax. I know that some of my colleagues want to air grievances tonight. I simply sum up by saying that I hope that the documents which have been incorporated in Hansard will be the subject of a minute examination by all the Ministers I have mentioned. I hope that this will be done in the not too far distant future. I am not casting any reflection on the Minister at the table, Senator Messner. But sometimes some Ministers respond quicker than others. I simply say, again without any reflection on Senator Messner, that tomorrow morning I will follow the trail that has been blazed by my illustrious South Australian colleague, Senator McLaren. Each Minister will get, with my compliments, a copy of the Hansard extract. I will underline the area that is within his responsibility. I can then look the officials of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association in the eye and say that I have done my best.

         â€”I wish to raise a matter this evening which I was unable to raise today because I did not get the call at Question Time. The next opportunity available to me to ask questions is the adjournment debate. The matter to which I wish to refer is the return to Australia of an ex- Governor-General. I am not going to use his title when I refer to him although I know it will appear in Hansard because of an instruction that you, Mr President, gave here last Thursday. I want people who may read Hansard to know from the outset that at no stage will I be using the title that was bestowed upon this man. In today's Age a photograph of him appears. The headline states: ' Holidaying Kerr says he will return for good.' I think one of the most interesting things in the particular article in the Age is that Tandberg, who is recognised as one of Australia's foremost cartoonists, depicts Sir John Kerr standing on the edge of a canal. A person has a bucket and is dipping some water out. The comment from Sir John Kerr is 'just a dash'. We all know that the cartoon refers to the famous Melbourne Cup meeting when he disgraced himself some years ago. When my colleague, Senator Walsh, referred to the incident in the Senate he was castigated by people who sit opposite who thought that he was engaging in untruths. Of course, those of us who witnessed the episode at the Cup meeting on television and then saw a replay at night knew that Senator Walsh was not strong enough in his remarks.

        The matter which concerns me today is why this man, on his return to Australia from exile, has been provided with office accommodation in the Commonwealth Offices in Sydney. He is provided with chauffeur-driven cars at the taxpayers' expense. It is also reported in the article in the Age today that he is provided with a secretary and a bodyguard. What is the need for this man to be provided with a bodyguard when he returns to Australia? I know he is very unpopular but surely his life is not in so much danger that he needs a bodyguard. He says that at some future date he will return for good. I want to know whether the Australian taxpayer will have to provide him with a permanent bodyguard if he ever decides to come back and live in this country. I think it is an utter disgrace that he is provided with these facilities. In another paper today it is reported that he is provided with a Commonwealth office in London. Of course, I know that. With my persistence in the Senate, I was given that answer some time ago. In London he is provided with an office, a secretary and, I think, the use of cars. But quite apart from that he is in receipt of an annual pension of $52, 000. When he arrived in Sydney the other day he was picked up by a chauffeur- driven Ford LTD, similar to the vehicle which met him at the airport. Of course, that is the same car that picked him up at Chifley Square yesterday. When asked why he returned to Australia, he said:

        Here is a person who left this country in disgrace. The Government now sees fit to provide him with an office in Sydney, a bodyguard, a secretary and chauffeur- driven cars just because, as he says, he is here to have a holiday and to see his family and friends. We have a government which is daily-no doubt it did so at the Premiers Conference today-pleading for financial restraint. Yet, it is prepared to provide this man with luxurious surroundings; an office in Sydney. What is he doing there? He is certainly not carrying out any business. Perhaps he is filling in Christmas cards and posting them to his friends. He is certainly not carrying out any business on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. I am sure about that. The questions I pose tonight are: What will be the cost of his stay in Australia? Who authorised the provision of the facilities which he is using while he is in Australia? I also want to know whether the office accommodation and the secretarial staff that he is provided with in London is still in operation whilst he is absent from the United Kingdom? If it is, is he paying for that himself or will the taxpayers be liable for a double-headed bill -one for maintaining the facilities and services in London whilst he is having a good holiday with his family and friends in Australia and another for the office accommodation, secretarial staff, chauffeur driven cars and a bodyguard whilst he is in this country? Those are the questions which I pose and which I would like answered before the Senate rises.

        I am sick and tired of the work force of this country being lambasted daily, from pillar to post, by a Government that says wage claims are too high that they are the real cause of the downturn in the economic situation in this country. This Government daily goes on record in the printed press, on radio and on television as calling upon the Australian work force to exercise wage restraint yet it can find any amount running into thousands of dollars, to keep this man in luxury. He has a pension of $52,000 a year which is provided by the taxpayers of this country. That ought to be enough for him and his wife.
       </para>
       <para>
        The work force of this country is being pilloried every day and blamed for the economic chaos that surrounds us. As I said a while ago, the work force would be bearing the brunt of the blame in the other chamber today whilst the Premiers are meeting. No doubt we will see in the Press tomorrow that the Government is castigating the Labor Premiers from the three Labor States who will not lie down and agree-I hope they will not agree-to wage restraint or a wage freeze on the work force of this country. If the Government applied such restraint to some of the tall poppies in this country, particularly Sir John Kerr, who are on extremely high salaries I would agree with it. Sir John Kerr, in my view, is highly overpaid for what services he rendered to this country. I have said before in this Parliament that it would be a good thing for Australia if he were to remain in exile overseas where he said he and his wife are having a wonderful and enjoyable life. Of course he gets paid for something else. I understand that he is chairman of some company whilst he is in the United Kingdom. That salary would be on top of the $52,000 which is being provided by the taxpayers of this country. This Government stands condemned at this time when it is asking for wage restraint for providing these luxurious services for this man on his return to Australia from exile.

         â€”On 19 May this year I spoke at some considerable length in the adjournment debate on the subject of the imminent deportation of Brett Anthony Collins, a subject on which my colleague Senator Mulvihill also spoke on that day. I do not propose this evening to speak at any great length on the subject but it is appropriate to mention the matter yet again because the Collins case is very much alive, if not well. The deportation order that was applicable last time round was not due to be activated before the end of May 1982 and, indeed, it has not been activated until the present time. But the new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hodges, has now made very clear that he does propose to deport Collins and that this deportation will be effective more or less immediately. I raise this issue again in order to repeat my call that the Minister reconsider that decision, and reconsider it very carefully indeed. I believe it will be an unfortunate day for the community and for the system of ministerial discretion governing these deportation matters if Collins does prove to be deported.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I spelt out last time, at some considerable detail, my approach and what I believe is the approach generally of the Australian Labor Party on this matter, and more specifically my reasons for believing that the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted in that instance by Mr Justice Davies, was less than satisfactory. The particular points from that speech that I wish to reiterate I think are crucial to the case that needs to be made and they are these: The relevant criteria for a deportation order that should be applied by the Minister are the real likelihood of recidivism, the contributions to the community which the person has made, the family ties and the social networks that the person has created and the dislocation to them that will result if the person has to leave the community in question.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat the point I made on that occasion that it seems to me-indeed this was a point made by the Labor Party generally in the context of the proposed then deportations of Messrs Pochi and Barbaro-that a deportation should be made by the Minister only when the strongest possible probity of evidence is available to him of involvement and likely continuing involvement by that person in an activity which is totally incompatible with that person's continued membership of the Australian community. I find it impossible now, as I found it impossible in May, to believe, on the very large amount of material which I have scrutinised in relation to the Collins case, that that criterion, or indeed any of the other criteria that I have mentioned, could possibly be satisfied in this case.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge the Minister to revoke the order and to do so on the basis that the particular judicial decision on which he is so obviously relying in this case was manifestly insensitive to the basic principles which ought to be applied in this area. Consideration of deportation cases has to be done necessarily on a case by case basis. I acknowledge, as I have previously, that ultimately ministerial discretion in these matters is essential. I am disappointed that the seemingly enlightened and courageous approach of the new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Pochi case has in fact disappeared. I would hate to think that the relatively small amount of controversy which that decision of his generated has forced him to retreat and to make now some capitulation to the various forces of reactionary darkness around the place at the expense, in this instance, of Mr Collins, whose case in my view is every bit as strong and indeed perhaps stronger than that of Pochi's. I make a final plea for a continuation of that enlightened approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there is any suggestion-as there certainly was in the judgment of Mr Justice Davies, which I spent some time on before-that Mr Collins is being deported because he is an activist, a reformer, a critic and an embarrassment to the prison establishment or, in other words, that he is being expelled essentially for his political activities, that seems to me to be a grave indictment of this Government and the Minister and a reflection on the New South Wales Administration to the extent that that Administration has been placing continual pressure on the Federal Government to this effect. Of course, it is also a very serious commentary on the capacity of the Australian community for self- criticism.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remaining point I want to make is that the Collins case is not simply something that is being taken up in a quixotic way just by myself. In fact, it has been the subject of representations to the Minister by an extraordinarily large number of people who are very prominent not only in New South Wales but also in the national Australian community. I seek leave to table some letters. I regret I did not have the opportunity to raise this with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) before. I seek to table a collection of letters sent to the Minister making representations on Collins's behalf. The letters-I mention the names alphabetically-are from Mr Kevin Anderson, Stipendiary Magistrate in Sydney; the Honourable Franca Arena, member of the Legislative Council; Miss Susan Armstrong, Assistant Ombudsman in New South Wales; Mr John Basten, lecturer in law in New South Wales; Colin Bevan, the Assistant Director of Training at the Australian Institute of Criminology; Mr Lionel Bowen, M.P.; Dr John Braithwaite of the Australian Institute of Criminology; Mr David Brown, another Sydney lecturer; David Buchanan of the Sydney Bar; Senator John Button, Leader of the Opposition in this place; Dr Moss Cass, M.P.; Senator Don Chipp; Peter Coleman, M.P.; Ken Buckley, the long-time Secretary of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties; Mr John Cornwell, M.L.C., of South Australia; Joan Coxsedge, M.L.C., of Victoria; John Dahl, a justice of the peace in New South Wales; Senator Georges; Senator Gietzelt; Al Grassby; Bill Hayden, the Leader of the Opposition; John Hatton, the Independent member of parliament in New South Wales; Gordon Hawkins, Director of the Institute of Criminology at Sydney University Law School; Ted Innes, M.P.; Senator Jim Keefe; John Kerin, M.P.; Lenn Lehmann, from the South Australian Prisoners Action Committee; Les McMahon, M.P.; Lynn Buchanan from the Macquarie Legal Centre; Rod Madgwick, President of the Australian Society of Labor Lawyers and a prominent Sydney barrister; Michael Maher, M.P.; Senator Colin Mason, Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats; George Peterson, M.L.A.; Senator Cyril Primmer; Senator Peter Rae; Matt Derham, the Co-ordinator of the Victorian Association for the Care and Rehabilitation of Offenders; and Professor Tony Vinson, the professor of social work at the University of New South Wales.

       It is understood the honourable senator's question refers to manual assistance centres (MAC) which are currently located in 37 country centres in New South Wales. These centres are staffed by Telecom telephonists and handle trunk and international calls which customers are unable to dial themselves, directory enquiries, and service difficulty reports.

       (4) There is a diminishing requirement for MACs due to the increasing availability of automatic facilities such as STD and ISD. The availability of alternative employment is one of several factors taken into account when determining MAC closures. Also, it is the practice to give staff the opportunity to transfer to a MAC in the capital city or another provincial centre.

The Victorian Supreme Court Registry confirmed the accuracy of this figure; the Registry does not however maintain statistics of appeals instituted or heard for each year.

       The criteria against which Australia's share of the global quota established by the International Tin Council is allocated among Australian mines do not include consideration of the financial status of the mining company or the individual miner concerned. The main criteria are that the mine should have been in production in 1981 and is, in the current quarter, an operating mine. However, it is known from publicly available information that several tin mining companies which have received tin quotas are operating under the management of a receiver.

       No individual quotas have been established under the tin quota arrangements for small tin miners irrespective of whether they are established miners or are operating for the first time. However, a collective allocation, known as the small mine allocation, has been provided to enable merchants who supply tin to the domestic smelters to buy tin concentrates from small miners who do not have individual quotas. This collective allocation is calculated on the basis of the share of 1981 production held by mines in this category and for the October to December 1982 period, amounts to approximately 92 tonnes of tin contained in concentrates.

      <para>
       (1) The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation's 1982-83 budget provides a total of some $267,000 for expenditure associated with the promotion of wine for export in 1982-83. In addition, licensed wine exporters have undertaken to contribute approximately $64,000 to the Corporation's promotional effort for 1982-83.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The main markets in which the Corporation is concentrating its export promotional effort in 1982-83 are the United States of America, Canada, Netherlands, West Germany and United Kingdom, totalling some $165,000. In addition an amount of $125,000 has been allocated to cover the total operating cost of the Corporation's international marketing manager who is responsible for the co-ordination of export promotional activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the full details of the promotional campaigns planned for each market are still being finalised, the Corporation has advised that it intends to employ 'below the line' campaigns (that is promotions other than large scale media advertising) in conjunction with the Australian Trade Commissioner Service and exporters to the markets concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation has as one of its major functions the overseas promotion of wine, and it is therefore a matter for the Corporation to determine the application of funds available to it for this purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Corporation is of the view that the levy imposed on wine grapes crushed, which provides funds for the Corporation, should be increased to provide additional funds for overseas promotion. There is, however, a difference of opinion within the winemaking industry as to whether the rate of wine grapes levy should be increased and the matter is still under consideration.

       In the course of a comprehensive review of its foreign investment policy last year, the Government also considered, in consultation with the States, what measures might be taken to obtain comprehensive information on foreign ownership of rural land. Consideration was given, in particular, to the possibility of establishing a register of foreign ownership in rural land. After careful examination of this issue, the Government concluded that, as responsibility for land titles and usage rests with the States and Territories, the appropriate course would be to leave establishment of land ownership registers to the States , should they wish to do so.

       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. The Australian Government Publishing Service was conducting a trial marketing of a small quantity of the 7 booklets which comprise the series ' Australian Farming Systems' at full reprint prices. Subsequently more substantial supplies of the series were obtained for sale purposes from stocks intended originally for overseas trade promotion purposes, thus avoiding a reprint and enabling a reduction to the AGPS normal pricing level based on the marginal cost of production. These prices for the series, which are almost all in full colour, are: 'An Introduction'-$3.60, 'Irrigation'-$3.50, 'The Arid and Semi-Arid Region'-$3.50, 'The Tropics'-$3.70, 'The Subtropics'-$4.90, 'The Temperate Region'-$5.90, 'Directory of Goods and Services'-$7.10.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Prices for AGPS publications are normally based on the marginal or run-on cost of production for supplies obtained from original print runs. A considerable degree of subsidisation is therefore involved, depending upon length of print run and the cost of preparing the production. Where reprints are required to meet continuing sales demand and the sponsoring agency has neither a requirement or funds to assist in re-printing, the full costs are met from the AGPS Publications Trust Account. Higher prices thus result. The Publications Trust Account is intended to maintain a state of balance between its out-goings and its revenue and is therefore of a commercial nature.

In his Press Release the Treasurer stated that the Deputy Crown Solicitor had been requested to advise whether the available evidence would support a prosecution. Advice was subsequently sought from senior counsel on the matter and, as indicated by the Treasurer, it was the opinion of counsel, not of the Deputy Crown Solicitor, that, on the basis of the material presented by the Commissioner, grounds existed for prosecution under the Companies Act and Commonwealth Crimes Act. However, the ensuing correspondence and discussions with the Crown Solicitor resulted in the Commissioner receiving Crown Law advice, in April 1979 and September 1980, to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of 'conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth' and that proceedings under the Crimes Act and Companies Act would not be productive.

      </para>
      <para>
       He added that intensified investigative activity to challenge the schemes has continued. As I mentioned, raids on premises by the Australian Federal Police in order to seize documents have been conducted where necessary. A number of car dealers have received sales tax assessments in which additional tax equal to 100 per cent of the tax assessed has been imposed. In addition, the investigations have led to the cancellation of the sales tax registrations of several companies used by the promoters of the schemes. Charges under the Crimes Act have also been laid against some of the parties associated with the promotion of one scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner added that one of the results of this intensified activity is that participation in most of the known sales tax schemes now appears to have ceased.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is aware of the assertions by Mr Cosmos which were widely reported in the Press. The Commissioner advised that the secrecy provisions of the sales tax law prevent him giving details of the amounts of commissions earned by any particular promoter or of his investigations relating thereto. With regard to the alleged motor vehicle transaction on which only $18 sales tax was said to have been paid, the Commissioner was unable to comment specifically. However he did advise that payments of amounts of sales tax in this vicinity, which represent a fraction of the sales tax correctly payable, do accord with the known facts of some of the sales tax schemes being investigated.

       There is no contradiction between the letter from the Prime Minister dated 15 July 1977 and the Treasurer's statements. The paper forwarded with the Prime Minister's letter referred to Slutzkin-type arrangements, which involve the sale of shares in a company with accumulated profits. These arrangement do not involve the evasion of company tax on profits. On the other hand, the Treasurer 's statements and the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act were directed at the stripping of untaxed company profits. The extent of this untaxed profit stripping activity was not evident until returns of income for the year ended 30 June 1977 were lodged. At that time, early 1978, the Commissioner of Taxation drew the Treasurer's attention to the problem. That and subsequent advice led to the enactment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. The new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act contains measures to deal with the sale of accumulated profits that have borne primary company tax.

        â€”On 20 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1616) Senator Gietzelt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health a question without notice relating to the alcohol content of beer. As indicated in his answer, Senator Peter Baume referred to the Treasurer that part of the question concerning a lower rate of excise duty on low alcohol beer.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Treasurer has supplied the following information on the excise issue:
      </para>
      <para>
       In May 1980 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety recommended, in its report on Alcohol, Drugs and Road Safety, that consideration be given to reducing the excise imposed on low alcohol beer. On 28 October 1982 the Minister for Transport and Construction tabled the Government's response to the report in Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       The relevant section of the Government's response noted that there would be a road safety benefit if existing beer drinkers could be persuaded to switch to low-alcohol beer, and that the recommendation to consider reducing the excise on low alcohol beer was supported on road safety grounds. It noted that health and safety implications are taken into account in the Government's consideration of excise options and that, in response, inter alia, to the erosion of real excise rates since the previous excise increase in 1978, the excise rate on all beer was increased by approximately 15 per cent in the 1982- 83 Budget. In the budgetary circumstances, however, it was not considered appropriate to introduce a lower excise rate on low alcohol beer. Nevertheless, the Government's response to the report undertook to consider the proposal again when excise rates are next under review.
      </para>
      <para>
       All considerations-road safety, health and budgetary-suggest that an excise differential would best be achieved by increasing the excise rate on higher alcohol beers rather than cutting the rate on lower alcohol beers.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the practicability of such a course, or its extension to include a third tier of higher excise on beers with a higher than average alcohol content -as seems to be envisaged in Senator Gietzelt's question-is greatly affected by administrative issues. These include the difficulties of differentiating at the excise collection point among apparently similar products, and any associated problems of substitution. An excise differential would encourage similar substitution possibilities at the retail level at a cost to the consumer and to Budget revenue. When the matter has been considered on previous occasions, these administrative difficulties have been among the factors deterring the Government from proceeding with the proposal.
