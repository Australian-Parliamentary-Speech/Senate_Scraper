        That the Senate take note of the papers and the statement.

        I move the motion at this unusual time because of the unusual circumstances. What we have, in fact, had is a bland statement of ministerial rearrangements, no explanation and, tabled at the last minute, some accompanying documents referring apparently to the resignation of two Ministers of the Government. The matter which lies behind the resignation of the two Ministers goes beyond the private concern of the Government, as is evidenced by the Press and public comment on this matter in recent weeks. It is for this reason that I wish the Senate to have the opportunity now and at a later time, I hope, to examine it more closely.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several crucial points arise out of the resignation of two Ministers of the Crown, which deserve a full explanation in this Parliament. The Opposition insists that the Parliament and the public receive these explanations. We certainly have not done so today. We certainly have not received such explanations in the statements issued so far. This is not a simple matter. Many questions must be asked and answered. We must know in what circumstances and how a Minister of the Crown in this country can allow, for instance, a staff member to sign a legal declaration on his behalf. We have to know what a Minister of the Crown is doing by apparently making, directly or indirectly, a false declaration to the Customs authorities. We must know how it was that, when that declaration was detected as being false, in fact no action was taken. We must know whether it is true, as alleged, that officers of the Bureau of Customs were ordered to remain silent by more senior officers and carpeted in order that this instruction would be conveyed to them. We have to know who, if anybody, instructed the senior officers and what part the Minister responsible for Customs played in these proceedings, because he knew what had happened within hours of what occurred. We have to know why no action was taken from 5 October last year, when the incident occurred, until 16 April this year, when the incident hit the public through the Press. We want to know the series of events and why there was a delay in the series of events which have occurred since 16 April. We believe that this delay and the manner in which this matter was conducted reflect much and reveal much of the attitude of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        We remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) initially dismissed this incident as being trivial. The two Ministers concerned flew to Canberra to consult and to draw up a statement. At 8 p.m. on that day they left for Fairbairn Airport to return home, but were recalled to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and remained there until 1.35 a.m. Still no statement was made. The whole of Saturday, 17 April, was spent by the two gentlemen preparing a statement which was released at 5 p.m. At a Press conference at the time, the essential facts of the case were admitted by the Ministers concerned. Yesterday, Monday, 19 April, we were subjected to a spectacle of discussions by Ministers, by the Cabinet and by the two Ministers involved from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. At 8 minutes past 8 last night, the resignations of the two Ministers were announced.
       </para>
       <para>
        These two Ministers are the twentieth and twenty-first Ministers to have resigned or to have been pushed from this Government in the six years of its existence. Some of the Ministers were similarly under a cloud. I suggest that many people would think that one of them is still under a cloud. As has been said, the penalties for ministerial impropriety in this country are severe and they should be severe. I put it to honourable senators that the penalties are just, and it is equally just that we, as members of Parliament, and the public should receive a proper explanation of what has happened. Clearly, what happened in this case was that one Minister avoided the Customs provisions of this country. When detected, he was allowed to continue this avoidance. A second Minister, on being notified of this offence and being responsible for the area concerned, chose to ignore it. The Customs officers involved in this affair were , to put it crudely but clearly, stood over to avoid the affair becoming public.
       </para>
       <para>
        For three days and at considerable public expense the Government procrastinated and sought means of protecting the offending Ministers. Only after considerable pressure from the Press and the Opposition was action taken. Rarely in this country has there been such unanimous opinion amongst the editorialists of the most conservative newspapers, and they were all condemnatory of the Government and the delay in taking action against these Ministers. Quite clearly the Ministers were in disarray and, I suggest, are in disarray. We have had leadership challenges, we have had public brawling between Ministers and we have had attempts at a cover-up while we are facing our greatest economic crisis since World War II. The public and certainly the Opposition can have no confidence in a government with such clear divisions in its ranks even at ministerial level, a government which chooses to spend such time and such money- one can think alone of the VIP aircraft left standing at Canberra Airport for that time-on exercises like this while this country needs action and good government to get over its problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the position of the Customs officers who were involved? My colleagues in another place, Mr John Brown and Mr Hayden, will be moving for an inquiry into the treatment of these Customs officers and the manner in which they were asked to cover up for ministerial indiscretions in this way. There are legal implications. I hope my colleague Senator Evans will discuss this aspect again this afternoon. But the simple fact of the matter is that this Parliament and the public of this country cannot be pushed off and fobbed off by the Minister coming in here and making a bland statement on ministerial rearrangements, with no explanation from him as to just what has gone on and what will go on in the future, and by tabling the official documents which relate to this matter. We will, of course, want to examine those documents and discuss them later but we believe that the Parliament deserves a better explanation than it has had. We believe that the country deserves better behaviour than we have had from Government Ministers in this place not only in the last few days and few months but also in the last six years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have moved that the Senate take note of the statement because we will need to continue this debate. I hope the House of Representatives takes note of the motion which will be moved in that place today by my colleagues. I can assure the Government and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) that, unless we get a better explanation than we have had and unless we get the opportunity to debate this matter in the manner in which we should be able to debate it, we will take further action in this Senate in an effort to ensure that proper government is seen to be done.

         —It needs very little time for the Senate to appreciate the issues of substance and principle that are involved in the essence of the statement made here today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick). No doubt a careful reading and canvassing of the documents that have been tabled will enable a fuller appreciation of all the sordid details of the Moore-MacKellar affair and no doubt we, as a Senate, will want to debate those sordid details further in the light of that study. Certainly, I do not wish to indicate in any way by standing to continue the debate on the motion moved by Senator Grimes that that is where we propose to leave the matter. We will, in fact, accept the Minister's offer for the debate to be brought on in Government time, either at a later hour this day or on a later day, in order that the issues might be more fully canvassed and explored than they can be at the moment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Nonetheless, many aspects of this matter can be the subject of an immediate response. The basic response must be that the Ministry reconstituted today, the subject matter of which is the essence of Senator Sir John Carrick's statement, is a Ministry over which there now hangs a palpable stench of decay. The Fraser Government is a government which, as this morning's Australian newspaper rather nicely put it, has suffered an attrition rate of 36 per cent since 1975 when it came into office. Such an attrition rate, incidentally, would be quite intolerable if we were talking about an aircraft or a motor car and would long since have resulted in the substitution for it of a new model.
       </para>
       <para>
        The attrition rate has been brought about by the 16 departures from the Fraser Ministry which have occurred since 1975-departures brought about as a result of dismissal, of resignation, of what has been euphemistically described as early retirement, or of suspension. I remind the Senate that the list is an impressive roll call, involving the names of Messrs Garland, Lynch, Ellicott, Sheil, Withers, Robinson, Sinclair, Webster, Cotton, McLeay, Adermann, Staley, Groom, Peacock and now, of course, Moore and MacKellar. Fully five of those 16 were resignations, suspensions or premature departures based on circumstances of personal impropriety or apparent lack of probity arising, not out of the conduct of their ministerial portfolios, but out of their personal conduct. That was the situation governing the suspension, dismissal or resignation of Messrs Garland, Lynch, Withers, Robinson and Sinclair. As a result of this long, sorry and sordid course of events we have a government composed of people who do not deserve the confidence of either this Parliament or this nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a situation, following the roll call announced by Senator Sir John Carrick today, in which a number of obviously more competent potential Ministers are still languishing on the back benches of this Parliament-some of them, indeed, in the Senate. No doubt, among others, Senators Peter Rae, Jessop, Missen and Martin-Martin, I hasten to emphasise for the benefit of an honourable senator on the Government side-will not mind my mentioning their names in this context. Those sorts of people with their sorts of competence remain languishing on the back bench while those with thicker hides or those with more political muscle, such as the flameproof Mr Sinclair and his friends, sit it out imperturbably, prepared to wear allegations of impropriety and substantial conclusions of impropriety-for example, those brought down by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in the case of Mr Sinclair-while being at the same time prepared to pass judgment, as they did yesterday, on their colleagues Moore and MacKellar. What hypocrisy there was in the unanimity with which the Cabinet yesterday apparently voted on this matter, given some of the people there. There is a stench in the air. It is a stench which will certainly remain in the air as long as a number of the bodies lying around in this Ministry remain unburied.
       </para>
       <para>
        The theme of propriety and integrity in government has been constantly reiterated by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), nowhere perhaps more cogently and forcefully than in his electorate talk, subsequently widely publicised, on 12 March 1978 when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Without integrity-without the appearance and reality of integrity-no government can hope to have the confidence of the people, or the trust of the people.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were determined-
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the use of the past tense is more significant than at first sight appears-
       </para>
       <para>
        to restore Australians' faith in their national Government-and in the process of government. From the beginning, the Government desired to re-establish the absolute propriety and unquestioned integrity that were a hallmark--
       </para>
       <para>
        So he said-
       </para>
       <para>
        of the Menzies years in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the promise. What has the performance been? The gulf between the promise and the performance has been spectacular, perhaps nowhere more so than in the course of events which underlie the resignations, unfortunate as they may have been from the point of view of the individuals concerned, of Messrs Moore and MacKellar yesterday. There was the initial behaviour of Mr MacKellar in that Customs queue, at the very least behaviour which was arrogant and foolish. At the worst it was something much worse than that. It was behaviour which was seriously criminal under provisions of the Customs Act and possibly also under provisions of the Crimes Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of the criminality or otherwise of the behaviour of Mr MacKellar and the other characters in the cast is not something which we would wish to pursue now. Penalties have been paid, and paid at a very significant price, by the Ministers concerned as a result of yesterday's events. But the point in referring again, as we have previously, to those criminal offences which may well have been committed by the gentlemen involved-in various combinations of them-is to indicate what must have been apparent to all the parties involved, and that is the gravity, the seriousness and the inherent non-triviality of what was involved in the circumstances. So we had the initial behaviour of Mr MacKellar. We then had the subsequent behaviour of Mr MacKellar who, a few days later we are told-it is now on the public record-wrote a letter to his Minister, Mr Moore, offering to pay the relevant duty and, indeed, to pay the penalty duty . But that letter was not accompanied by any cheque for the amount in question and it was all too obviously rather a reverse of what lawyers tend to refer to as an invitation to treat. It was an invitation perhaps to do the converse of that.

         —That may be so and maybe that is one of the points of detail that can, in fact, be better discussed and better resolved at a later stage of this debate. Further, of course, there was the question of the initial behaviour of Mr Moore who refused to act, who refused to apply the law when the situation was brought to his attention, apparently initially orally and later in writing, exercising in the process a so-called discretion to waive the application of the penalty duty which is a course simply not allowed to him under the statute law as it presently stands. Should the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, be willing in Question Time or at any other time and place to deny the legitimacy of that legal conclusion I would be only too happy to hear from him. Following the behaviour of Mr Moore on that occasion there was associated with it the behaviour of Mr Moore's Department and his Customs officers who were either not asking themselves the right questions on a different view of the facts, or not giving the Minister the full information. Alternatively, at the very least, on yet another view of the facts they were simultaneously engaged in endeavouring to cover up the possible commission of an offence and to cover up in the process the complaints that were being made by junior officials. That, as Senator Grimes has said, will be the subject matter, we believe, of debate in another place.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There was the behaviour in concert of Messrs Moore and MacKellar who, we are told, spent something like 18 hours putting together an account of what happened which should have taken them no more than about half an hour if the facts were as clear cut, if their moral guilt, as distinct perhaps from technical guilt, was as doubtful as has been indicated in the text of that statement when it finally did appear some two days after the issue was first set in running. As we further explore the gulf between promise and performance on this question of probity and propriety, there has been the attitude of the Prime Minister, the fount of all probity and all propriety so far as this Government is concerned. He is a Prime Minister who, to the Press through his own private staff, and to the public through the Press, made it clear that his own initial reaction was that this was no more than a bit of minor aberrant misbehaviour by the Ministers in question and could be regarded as essentially a peccadillo of the kind that would be appropriately dealt with by a slap on the hand. But this was a position on the part of the Prime Minister which was manifestly utterly inconsistent with the gravity of the situation as must have been apparent to him by Friday evening on even the most cursory examination of the relevant law and the relevant material before him.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then there was the attitude of the Cabinet which once again did not react as quickly as one would have thought it inevitably had to when the matter finally came before it yesterday. It was a Cabinet which took fully five hours to reach what obviously was the only possible decision that could be made by any government anxious to preserve any shred of credibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a government which will not do the right thing because it is the right thing. It will do the right thing only because it is forced into acting in that way. It will do the right thing-it will seek to pay the price that must be exacted for doing the wrong thing-only when it is caught, as it were, in flagrante delicto. Here the only reason the right thing was ultimately done, the only reason any steps were taken to preserve any shred of credibility of the Westminster conventions of ministerial resignation, was that the Government was exposed in the course of action in which it, through the misbehaviour and foolish behaviour of its Ministers, had become involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not as a result of any commitment to probity or propriety on the part of the Prime Minister or any one of his senior Ministers, including the senior Minister sitting in here today, that this course of events took place. It was a result of, first, the exposure of the affair by unhappy junior Customs officers; secondly, the running of the story in the Australian newspaper last Friday; thirdly, the naming of the hitherto unnamed Minister by the Australian Labor Party through our spokesman, John Brown, on Friday; and finally, of course, the universal editorial condemnation of the situation by the whole of the nation's Press yesterday morning.

        So this is a Ministry, the recomposition of which was announced to us today, which is being constructed now, as it has been from the outset, entirely on the wrong principles. It is a Ministry which was put together on a basis which has nothing to do with the quality and the competence of the individual members of it, as undoubtedly will be testified to by only too many honourable senators sitting on the opposite side of this chamber. It is a Ministry which has been constituted on a basis which has nothing to do with the best interests of this nation. Rather, it has everything to do with serving the selfish demands and preoccupations of the National Party in this nation. It is a Ministry the composition of which has everything to do with preserving the Prime Minister's own narrow-extremely narrow-personal and ideological power base within his party . It is a Ministry which, so constructed, is increasingly obviously out of touch with the needs of this nation and, as was demonstrated by the affairs of the last week or so, increasingly out of touch with the wishes, the desires and the needs of his own political party.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are confronted in this Ministry with a shaking, tottering edifice. One of the reasons that this Ministry-this Government- is so shaking and so tottering is that it is rotten at the core and it remains rotten at the core notwithstanding the latest round in this long history of purges to which this once proud party has been subjecting itself during the whole lifetime of this Ministry. There is no way that probity, propriety and integrity in government will be restored in this nation by just one or two further changes being made to the composition of this Ministry, by one or two more purges of the kind that have occurred with monotonous regularity since 1975. The only way that probity, integrity and propriety in government will be returned in Australia is by throwing out the whole lot of this Ministry and replacing it with an Australian Labor Party government.

       Plant Variety Rights

       1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognize that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage and research has been publicly funded.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.

      <para>
       4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:
      </para>

       (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,

       (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.

         —I do not believe that there were significantly false expectations of a resources boom. If there were, the main offender is the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Wran, who has issued statements saying that the amount of expenditure on resources development in New South Wales alone was $24.5 billion-that has been said in the course of the last year-whereas the Commonwealth as a whole has indicated something in the order of only $32 billion. Quite clearly, if the expectations are to be measured, they are to be measured in the first place as to the credibility or otherwise of Mr Wran's statements. I do not believe that any statement of mine was aimed at talking up the resources boom.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That can be tested very simply. Upon my discovery that there were differences between the partners of Rundle as to what might be the expectations I informed the Prime Minister and, as a result, the Treasurer and I approached the Rundle partners and brought about a situation in which a modified statement was made. My task as a Minister is aimed at presenting the accurate situation to the people of Australia. It was believed, as stated by the Rundle partners, that they had particular expectations at that time, for a variety of reasons that have now become known. One of those reasons was that certain defects were discovered in the mining area and the nature of the materials that were there would have constituted a mining wall which would have created further difficulties. Another reason, I have no doubt, was that the immediacy of the oil price rises had receded slightly. The Rundle process was altered so that the first three or four-year phase is to be done off-shore in America by tests of retorts and pilot plants. A subsequent phase will be undertaken here. Emphatically, it has not been my task to give other than the most accurate information available to the public. The test of that is that as soon as I became knowledgeable that, in fact, what was being represented to the public might not be right, I acted to make sure that that was corrected.

I came back and immediately reported that to the Prime Minister. We immediately set in train contact with the two partners.

         —It is true that the decision on the future of the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital redevelopment has been in gestation for quite some considerable time. In fact, the original reference, I think, was made back in July 1979. Since then the matter has been considered by the Public Works Committee. On its report becoming known to the Government in about September 1980, there was some further delay while certain propositions were put to the Federal Government by the Western Australian Government and also while there was reconsideration of the whole principle of repatriation hospitals which was undertaken by the Government in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions report. Since then there has been a further reconsideration of the matter by the Public Works Committee. I understand that very soon the Committee will be in a position to report to the Parliament as to the future of that development. We await that with a great deal of interest. Providing that report arrives in very quick time I will take the matter to the Budget Cabinet this year. I hope that we will be able to obtain funds for the development.

However, will the Minister agree that, compared with when the Government took office, inflation and unemployment are up, interest rates are at an all time high and rising, personal taxes are at an unprecedented level, people are queueing for emergency relief and tax avoidance is rife? In view of these facts, will the Minister agree that the old solutions being tried by the Government simply do not work any more and that the Government is deluding itself if it believes, as several of its spokesmen say, that the only problem is to improve its communications? In particular, is the Government prepared to consider a $500m increase in the Budget deficit to stimulate activity in the housing industry, the small business sector and community services? Further, will the Minister agree that industrial relations can be used either as a blunt political weapon to score cheap political points or as a most valuable economic tool to negotiate with trade unions to withhold unreasonable wage demands in exchange for a reduction in taxes or other benefits?

        <para in-line="1">
         —Senator Chipp has raised a many faceted question which draws attention to many of the matters that are of current concern both to the Government and to the people of Australia. In the early part of the question he referred to the public comments of television commentators and editors of financial and other newspapers. I think it is fair to say that in more recent days or weeks there has been a tendency to be alarmist about the state of the Australian economy, instead of looking at its strengths and at the very positive factors that exist for the people of this country. For instance, when talking about the number of projects that are set to go ahead in the development of our resources, one finds great controversy because some projects worth $2 billion are not to proceed. People should look instead at the projects worth over $30 billion that are to proceed. Sometimes we should approach things with optimism rather than pessimism.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Chipp mentioned inflation, unemployment, personal taxes and other individual aspects of the economy. Perhaps they ought to be subjected to more detailed comments than would be appropriate at Question Time. I have figures, for instance, on the activity in the housing industry which compare the lending approvals to individuals for housing by the major lenders. These figures show that in the three months to February 1982 approvals rose by 3.4 per cent compared with the three months to November 1981, and were 12.8 per cent below the level in the three months to February 1981. So one could be comparing figures which show a drop or one could be looking at figures which show a tendency to increase. Very often it is the period that one chooses for comparison that can become important.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the matter of industrial relations is concerned, I do think that what Senator Chipp has implied in his question is very important; that is, that it ought not to be simply a matter of controversy between the arms of government or employers and trade union movements to score cheap points from one another but rather that they ought to seek a way of working together in the interests of all . I am sure there are those in the trade union movement who are aware that the claims they make for changes in their own conditions or in their wage structures do have an adverse effect on those who are seeking employment opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, if we are to look at the figures that would reveal exactly what is happening, perhaps we ought to look at the seasonally adjusted data I have before me which reveal that employment increased by 1.2 per cent over the year to February 1982 which compares with a 2.4 per cent increase over the year to February 1981. In February employment fell by 0.1 per cent and in the three months to February employment fell by 0.1 per cent. I think it has been stated that the level of employment has been relatively flat this financial year, increasing by 0.4 per cent between June 1981 and February 1982. There are other figures which show the way in which full time employment has increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        If honourable senators look at the various sectors of full time, part time, male and female employment and so on they will see that these statistics are all relevant to the sort of question that has been raised by Senator Chipp. However, as his question related to industrial relations, I do think that it is appropriate that we should be working together to seek the way in which we are able to maximise employment opportunities and the structure of wages that can be paid to benefit all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other matter raised by Senator Chipp concerned interest rates. Here again we compare sometimes favourably and sometimes unfavourably with other countries. Schedules that I have for March 1982 show that with regard to the 180-day bank commercial bill rate Australia has around a 20 per cent rate compared with 16.5 per cent for the United States of America, 14.5 per cent for the United Kingdom, 13 per cent for West Germany and 16.5 per cent for Canada. So one does find relativities in other comparable countries. I take up the spirit of Senator Chipp's question by saying that it would be very timely for Australians to look at many of the statistics, to analyse the problems and the strengths within the Australian economy and to seek to work together to present the best opportunities in the coming year.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was a proposal in the question with regard to a $500m addition to the deficit. Perhaps it is not unknown to honourable senators that this Budget will show a substantial increase in the deficit over what was forecast at the time the Budget was introduced last year. Perhaps those who during the year have been suggesting that there ought to be some increase in the deficit have not taken into account the fact that there has been an increase in the deficit and that it has not had the result that would have been predicted if we had been talking about, for instance, a $1 billion deficit at the time we cast the Budget last year. So these things do need to be measured at different times. As we are now entering a pre-Budget consultative process, I think the question of whether a $ 500m deficit would be the appropriate way in which to increase assistance to housing or to small business or whatever, would be better left not discussed by me at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has also been implied in the question is that it may be said that there is just a breakdown in the communication of Government policy, and that that is the problem. I would never argue that if a policy is wrong good communications will have a positive effect. Equally, I would possibly argue that if a policy is right its effect will be self-evident. Perhaps much could be done in communicating with the Australian people to gain for them a better understanding of the economy. I think this could be shared by all of us in this place and by those who are the mass communicators through the media of this country. However, if we have the opportunity at any time to discuss in more detail some of the facets of the Australian economy, I think there are very relevant statistics that could well be explained to the Australian people to give them a better understanding of the problems and the underlying strengths.

         —The question of waste oil disposal is one that comes within my brief. That leaves some 74,800 kilolitres unaccounted for. The waste oil that is being re-used is in the main being blended with fuel oil for subsequent burning as fuel. When used in this way the full energy value of the oil is recovered. Used lubricating oil can also be re-refined to produce a lubricant as good as the virgin lubricating oil from which it is derived. One such refiner is currently operating in the Sydney area. The major problem facing greater use of the resource in this way is that of guaranteeing adequate supplies of used oil of a consistent quality. One of the problems is that oil is now sold through supermarkets for oil changing at home and it is very hard to collect the waste. Other uses for waste oil are spraying roads for dust, marking sports grounds and preserving timber fences. The matter is an important one. I will provide further detailed information to the honourable senator and arrange for its inclusion in Hansard.

The fact is that in the Schools Commission reports the non-government schools have been shown to have levels of amenities and assets much below those of the State schools. The Schools Commission has consistently recommended that the amenities and assets should be lifted and put to better use . The Schools Commission has a strong overview of the non-government school sector and it is conscious that the money being applied to that sector is not being wasted but, in fact, that some 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the non- government schools have levels of amenities and general conditions well below those of the State schools. So I fear that any pressure upon the non-government schools is grossly misdirected. Incidentally, the general public is exercising its freedom of choice and more members of the general public are now moving towards the non-government schools. The methods of accountability for the State schools would vary in the various States. I would need to seek that information and make it available to the honourable senator.

         —As always Senator Walsh takes liberties with the facts in stating these matters. As to the first matter, the Prime Minister has stated the standards he expects from his Ministers. Not only does he expect them but also he demands and receives them. Indeed, the actions of the two Ministers yesterday are in accordance with the Westminster standards. The standards required by the Prime Minister are those which, in the Westminster system, are regarded as being of the highest ethics and being standards more rigid than those demanded of others. I have repeated in this place before that the matter with regard to Mr Nixon concerns a minor shareholding in a primary industry co- operative. In other words, if one is a farmer and one markets through a co- operative one holds some nominal shares in that co-operative from which one only gets the benefit, as I understand it, in that the co-operative does the handling and the marketing. Everybody knows that that is a basic principle within the rural community. Everybody knows that it is not in the true sense a pecuniary interest in that the shares are talked up in value or anything of that nature. Also, everybody knows that Mr Nixon, by his actions, penalised the co-operative and made a decision against the co-operative; so it would be good to look at the other side of the moon.

        As to the third statement, which no doubt relates to Mr Sinclair, let us put the record straight. Mr Sinclair is not guilty in any way of any misappropriation. The courts of the land found that, and it is up to every member of this Senate to uphold that finding because it is the rule of law. It is a sad fact that Mr Sinclair's father apparently misappropriated some funds, and it has been the sad duty of Mr Sinclair to face the situation. On his own statement, he is setting about to make repayments of those moneys. There is no reflection at all on Mr Sinclair in this matter, and the courts of the land have said that. I want to make it clear that in the continual raising of these matters there is no reflection at all upon the standards of conduct of those Ministers, and indeed, in the latter case, a court of law said so.

If I understood Senator Georges's question, it is that the Premier has said that he would be interested in the political affiliations of those working in the program. I would be interested, first of all, in the motivation of those working in the program to ensure that they were determined to stamp out trachoma and to carry out the treatment of those with trachoma. It has not been the practice, certainly with moneys that I have granted through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, to ask any questions about people's political affiliations. We are interested in the programs to which they are directing their efforts. I would be very interested in testing the proposals now before the Department of Health against the points which Senator Georges raised. On the other hand, I hope that those who took money to treat trachoma would not see that money as money which could be used to mount what were political programs not directed towards the primary purpose of health care and eye care.

I believe that that takes into account factors that are not available to us at present in any description. Clearly, by virtue of the telex which I have just read out to the Senate, it is not the kind of question that can be answered in any way at all.

In view of the advertisements on the local radio station 2XX for people to join with the Ex-servicemen for Peace and Disarmament and the Canberra College of Advanced Education students, will the Minister tell the Senate what inquiries were carried out by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to establish the bona fides of these groups before granting them permission to join the Anzac Day march? Will the Minister give consideration to meeting the costs of the Council of the Australian War Memorial and the Australian Capital Territory branch of the Returned Services League in any challenge they wish to mount in the Supreme Court to establish the bona fides of these organisations to join the traditional Anzac march? Will the Minister give consideration to banning all visual media coverage of the event?

In the light of the Minister's frequent and public repetition that he would insist on four criteria being met in this matter, including perhaps especially, the criterion of security of tenure, why has he accepted the Queensland legislation?

         —I have read the analysis by the Reverend Mr Brennan. I have read one which was not attributed to anyone but which I take it is the one by Mr Pincus, Q.C., which was produced at about the same time. I believe the conclusions that they drew are as set out by Senator Ryan. Honourable senators may wish to consider the position which Aboriginal reserve communities in Queensland faced 15 months ago when the question was first raised that the Acts might be abolished and the reserves might be abolished. At that stage the Aboriginal communities faced the prospect of being left completely in a legal limbo living on crown land. The announcement by the Queensland Government on 1 March was an important one for Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as it represented the greatest indication by the Queensland Government of a desire to accommodate the communities with land tenure and with title.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Queensland Government's proposals and the subsequent legislation which has been passed represent a significant advance for reserve communities in Queensland. They are capable of meeting some of the principles which I outlined in the Senate on 19 August 1981. I say 'some of the principles' because Queensland has yet to develop its proposals on self-management and on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Acts. Honourable senators will know that the amendments so far are to the lands Acts which are concerned with tenure. The proposals which have now passes through the Queensland Parliament will mean that communities will have a title to their reserves, which they did not have previously. It will be perpetual title which will be held directly by the communities and not by a white intermediary. The title can be removed only by the Parliament of Queensland. There will be parliamentary review of any act of revocation although I think that will be a very unlikely act. It is a major advance to put title and responsibility for land in Queensland reserves into the hands of the community councils rather than having a single government official as a trustee of the reserve.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its announcement of 1 March, the Queensland Government indicated its intention to make this legislation work. The Commonwealth believes that the Queensland Government has acted in good faith in the changes it has made to the lands Acts. The Commonwealth still has some reservations, particularly about the possibile resumption of land which might occur during a parliamentary recess or before the Parliament had a chance to exercise its judgment. It is because of those concerns that the Commonwealth has backed up Queensland's action with its own unequivocal guarantee. I remind honourable senators that the Commonwealth has given an unequivocal guarantee that it will stand behind the stated intent of the Queensland Government to provide security of tenure and integrity to the reserve land. It has given an unequivocal guarantee that if actions transgressed these principles or indicated an unreasonable use of the discretions available under the legislation, the Commonwealth would act accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the Senate that one has to consider the amendments which have been made, the amendments which have yet to be produced and our guarantee, if one is to look at the package as a whole. It is one thing to look at the worst possible scenario one could draw on a legal analysis of document; it is another to look at that law and combine it with the Commonwealth's guarantee and some appreciation of the political realities applying in Australia in 1982.

         —The figures have been given to the Senate by me on a number of occasions. Several years ago when I first took over this portfolio, Australia's self-sufficiency in oil was 67 per cent. Therefore there was a need for a 33 per cent oil importation. It was also pointed out that, unless there were further discoveries, there would be a decline to 50 per cent by 1985, 40 per cent by 1990 and even to 10 per cent by the end of the century. That would have been very serious indeed and so a series of stimuli were applied to produce alternatives by way of exploration, conservation and conversion. At this point self-sufficiency remains at 67 per cent, although in the last few months industrial strife in Bass Strait has lowered the output of indigenous crude to about 65 per cent. The known reserves are now greater than they were some two, three of four years ago. That is a healthy situation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One cannot be over-optimistic about the projections but there has been record exploration. One in every four of the wildcat wells has produced a showing of oil which is very encouraging. Certainly there will not be a drop in self- sufficiency of the kind that we felt two or three years ago. It is even thought that with any reasonable optimism we may continue at about the 60 per cent level until at least the latter part of this decade and even to the end of it. But this figure will need to be revised as each year goes by.

In the case of accounting for non-governmental moneys we have recommended immediate amendments to the Australian Capital Schools Authority Ordinance. The 194th report contains matters arising from the Advance to the Minister for Finance.

       <para>
        The 193rd report refers to our investigation into certain aspects of the administration of the Departments of Defence, Transport, Foreign Affairs and the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. Our inquiry arose out of unfavourable comment by the Auditor-General in his reports for 1979-80 and March 1981. In relation to the Department of Defence the Committee concerned itself with the administration of HMAS Stirling, the naval base in Western Australia. We were generally satisfied with our findings. Likewise, in relation to the second harbour bridge construction, we looked at the Department of Transport's administrative activities and are satisfied that this agency acted properly in its use of the Commonwealth's financial commitment in this area.

       <para>
        Our examination of delays by the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority in presenting adequately framed financial statements for auditing purposes in respect of the years from 1976 to 1979 resulted in a number of important conclusions. We also comment upon the adequacy of that Authority's procedures for accounting for receipt and use of non-government moneys. The Committee finds the delay in presentation of financial reports quite unacceptable. We consider that the financial reports of the Authority should be presented to the Minister within three months of the close of the financial year. Similarly, we are disturbed that the Authority continues to use a cash based accounting system in spite of continued requests by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance to adopt accrual accounting. Our firm recommendation is that this be resolved urgently.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regarding accounting for non-government moneys, the Committee recommends appropriate amendments to the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority Ordinance 1976 be drafted without delay to rectify this accounting anomaly.

       <para>
        With respect to the Department of Foreign Affairs we examined comments in the Auditor-General's report for March 1981 relating to accounting at overseas posts . We make recommendations in this area which will have bearing upon cases such as that of embezzled money from the Australian Embassy in Washington, which was reported in January of this year. The Committee is considering this particular case, I should add, and will advise on its findings at a later date.

       </para>
       <para>
        This report deals with the Committee's examination of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, 1980-81. Expenditure by departments from the advance during that year was approximately $47.4m. In its annual inquiry into the advance, the Committee seeks to determine whether or not expenditure charged to the advance could have reasonably been foreseen in time for its inclusion in the additional estimates. As part of this approach, the Committee examines departments on the efficiency of their administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee requires departments to submit explanations in respect of all items of expenditure from the advance. In 1980-81 it received 129 explanations in relation to these items, and requested supplementary written information for 31 of the items from 12 departments. As part of the inquiry the Committee examined in public hearings the Australian Federal Police in relation to its administrative expenses, the medical and dental services of the Department of Defence, the Department of Finance on natural disaster relief and restoration funding, and the Department of Industry and Commerce on reserve capacity maintenance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's examinations revealed that in all cases expenditure from the advance was properly confined, that is, it met urgent and unforeseen requirements. However, we were concerned that some departments provided insufficient information in their initial submissions forcing us to make supplementary requests and causing undue delay. The Committee expects to see a considerable improvement in the 1981-82 submissions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report also makes recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of the programs which were examined. For example, the Committee's recommendations concerning the utilisation of defence hospitals by dependants of servicemen, and the need for the development of more suitable undergraduate training schemes, should improve the recruitment of service medical personnel.
       </para>
       <para>
        Implementation of the recommendations concerning the administration of natural disaster relief and restoration funding involve the Commonwealth adopting a more active role in approving relief measures. This should reduce the time taken for payments to be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's examination of reserve capacity maintenance at government factories indicated that the major issues were the length of time taken to resolve compensation cases and the incidence of appeal by the Commonwealth in such cases. The Committee will be considering this matter further in consultation with its legal advisors.

       <para>
        195th Report
       </para>
       <para>
        The 195th report details follow-up action taken on the Committee's recommendations and conclusions from our investigations of the financing and administration of property owned or leased overseas by the Commonwealth Government. The inquiry was prompted by the reorganisation of the Overseas Property Bureau, which was abolished in 1976 and its functions absorbed by the Department of Administrative Services. The Committee then broadened its inquiry to include organisations representing officers and their families serving overseas. The findings of the inquiry were tabled in 1978 as report 172.
       </para>
       <para>
        The response to the Committee, in the form of a Department of Finance minute prepared by an interdepartmental committee, was received in June 1980. After considering the finance minute the Committee decided that the response to certain recommendations was inadequate. Further information was sought at subsequent meetings in August and October 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        The excessive time taken to resolve this finance minute is not acceptable to my Committee. Two years elapsed from tabling of the report until receipt of a response. Then certain aspects of the response required further follow up. The original response to many sections of the report was generally obtuse and did not pay due regard to our requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee believes timely, accurate and complete feedback is essential if the full effects of its reports are to be realised. The conclusions and recommendations of the 172nd report were designed to draw attention to instances of administrative inefficiency and procedural weakness and consequently to improve the quality of public administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the finance minute on this report several matters are outstanding. The effect upon recovery for losses sustained through property damages and cleaning expenses of a joint management review of overseas accounting recommendations. The results of a review of the setting of rent ceilings. The Committee expects to be advised on the outstanding matters contained in this report at six-monthly intervals from this tabling until resolution.
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking on these reports I wish also to draw the Parliament's attention to delays we have experienced in receiving finance minutes on numerous of our reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Finance co-ordinates departmental responses to my Committee's reports, and sends us regular reports indicating progress in each department. They are dependent upon the co-operation of these departments in compiling the necessary responses which comprise a finance minute.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, the Department of Finance is beyond reproach in its supervisory function. But its job has of late been made difficult by delays from various departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The response by the Department of Health to our 182nd report, on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, tabled in September 1980, is one example of unacceptable delay which continues to occur. The response to our discussion paper on internal audit has also been slow, as has been the case with other matters contained within the 186th report on the advance to the Minister for Finance. In the case of our report on the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, the progress of Attorney-General's in responding to a major recommendation was glacial. This particular matter became so serious, and the delay so damaging, that I will be making a separate statement about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee wishes to put on record that it finds such delays quite unacceptable and that it expects, and will demand, better compliance from agencies in future.

         —The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1982 extends to steaming coal and some other types of coal an export levy at the rate of $1 per tonne. Ever since 1975 there has been a levy on higher grade coking coal which currently rests at $3.50 per tonne and it will remain at that level for the indefinite future, I presume, in spite of Government guarantees given about three years ago that the levy would be abolished. This move and the earlier application of a $3.50 per tonne levy on higher quality coking coal seeks to capture the economic rent component of coal prices. It is appropriate, in the view of the Australian Labor Party, that economic rent should be captured by governments for the benefit of the entire community. For that reason the Labor Party does not oppose this Bill. However, this particular form of capturing economic rent through a quantum levy is crude and inefficient. It is a means of capturing rent retained only because of the original opportunism and subsequent intransigence, even stupidity, of the members of the present Government. Although we approve of the objective we do not approve of the method. On behalf of the Opposition I move:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the existing coal export levies are indiscriminate and calls upon the Government to introduce legislation to abolish the coal export duty and replace it with a resource rent tax which takes into account the real level of costs and profits.'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concept of economic rent is not easy to grasp and, even when it is grasped, the magnitude of the economic rent component of any price is not easy to define precisely. Economic rent in its simplest and original form, as defined by Ricardo about 150 years ago, is the difference between the yield of grain from the least productive land in cultivation and the higher yield from all other land. That definition, of course, was given in a predominantly agricultural and simple economy. In today's more complex economy it could probably be best defined as any return to capital or labour in excess of that required to attract and hold the necessary amounts of capital and labour in an industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Economic rent conceptually takes many forms. It accrues to high grade and/or very accessible ore bodies. It accrues to fertile land. It accrues also to any holder of a monopoly right to participate in industry granted by a government or , perhaps more precisely, any monopoly right which carries with it monopoly power, such as quotas to keep hens, quotas to supply milk to protected markets, television licences and probably airline licences. Obviously, given the definition of economic rent as any return in excess of that required to attract and hold the necessary amounts of capital and labour in an industry, it follows that any sudden, unexpected windfall price gain will generate economic rent for people who were previously producing commodities for which the price gain occurred, particularly if the means of producing those commodities are not reproducible. That is what happened to existing oil producers after the oil price hike of 1973 because of the indirect effect of that oil price hike, windfall gains and economic rent spilt over into coal as, to some degree at least, an alternative to oil.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyone who has a nodding acquaintance with the subject should be aware of that. As I said earlier, it is difficult if not impossible, even for those who have grasped the concept, to isolate with precision the economic rent component from the total price. If that could be done with precision-I acknowledge that it cannot-it would be possible to tax away 100 per cent of that economic rent component, to appropriate it for the community, whereas any quantum levy will interfere with efficiency. The reason that any quantum levy will interfere with efficiency is that it violates the basic rule of efficient taxation; namely, that there should be no tax on marginal production-that is, production the cost of which is exactly equal to its market price. A resource rent tax-a tax related to profits instead of to production-that is accurately assessed imposes no tax at the margin. Any quantum levy-I stress any quantum levy-imposes a tax at the margin and therefore intereferes with efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        The economic principles which I have attempted to summarise ought to be understood, although they probably are not, by certainly any economics graduate and probably by anyone who has successfully completed the first year course. It is lamentable to report that they are apparently not understood by at least some , if not all, of the Ministers of this Government and by the Acting Director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, Mr Game. All of these people have failed to grasp the simple fact that at any level of taxation, at any level of community appropriation of the economic rent component of price, a resource rent tax is a more efficient system of taxation than any quantum levy. All the members of the Mining Industry Council do not necessarily support the views that its Acting Director, Mr Game, puts in public, so I will refer just to Mr Game's views. It appears from Mr Game's public statement that he has failed to realise that, with a variety of overt and covert quantum levies, State and Federal Governments are already appropriating the greater part of the economic rent in those projects to which it most spectacularly accrues, being Bass Strait oil and Bowen Basin coal.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a separate argument-a political argument, perhaps-derived from value judgments about whether the state should appropriate or attempt to appropriate 100 per cent of the economic rent component or whether it should settle for something less than that. That is one argument. My view is that if it were technically feasible-it is not quite because there are some variables that cannot be precisely identified in advance-all of the economic rent should be appropriated by the community. I hasten to add that that would have no effect on the efficiency of resource allocation. The second question, having determined the separate issue of what is the appropriate level of taxation, of appropriation of economic rent, concerns the means by which that revenue is collected or harvested. For the reasons that I have stated previously, it is inarguable that at any level of taxation, of appropriation of rent, it is more efficient to do it with a resource rent tax than with a quantum levy. It is deplorable that that logically inescapable conclusion, which ought to be understood by anyone who has done a fairly elementary economics course, apparently escapes the comprehension of Ministers of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It might help if, using figures which approximate the figures which actually apply now, I give a practical example of the way in which quantum levies impede efficiency and profit related taxes do not. Bass Strait oil is priced to Australian oil refiners at $30 a barrel. Of that $30, on average, the producers receive about $7. The actual cost of production is probably less than $2 a barrel. The producers receive about $7. The price paid by the refiners is $30. The $23 difference between the price received by the producer and the price paid by the refiners is absorbed by quantum levies imposed by the Government of Victoria and the Commonwealth Government. At some time as those fields approach exhaustion the cost of extracting that oil-I am using average figures to simplify the proposition-will exceed the price received by the producers. In other words, the producers are now receiving $7 and they are paying $23 excise.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the cost of actually extracting the oil reaches $10 a barrel, other things being equal, the total cost to the producers of production plus tax will be $33- $10 production cost plus $23 tax. With a market price at $30 it follows quite clearly that those fields will stop producing unless something is changed. Of course, in those circumstances I think not even the present Government could be so crass as to fail to change something. I do not believe that even the present Government would be so crass that it would allow fields which produce oil at $10 a barrel, which has a market value of $30 a barrel, to be abandoned. So much for the quantum levy. That is why it is not very efficient at capturing economic rent for the community and it interferes with the efficient allocation of resources and efficient management decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        A profits related tax, on the other hand-still with the same basic assumptions- would ensure that oil continued to be produced from those fields until the cost of actually extracting it was equal to its market price; in other words, until the cost of actually extracting it was $30, the same as the assumed market price . Under the present Government system production would cease when the cost of extraction exceeded $7. That relates to the point I made earlier, that with a resources rent tax no tax is imposed on marginal production. A properly designed resources rent tax-this figure will vary somewhat depending on what the product is and how many uncertain variables there may be-will capture probably around 90 per cent of the total economic rent for the community without impeding efficiency or interfering with sound management decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principles I have explained are, of course, most relevant and most important when they are applied to those mineral deposits which have a very high economic rent component, where a high proportion of the market price is economic rent. Nothing is as high in Australia right now as Bass Strait oil. Probably more than 80 per cent of the market price is economic rent. For even the best of Bowen Basin coal it is considerably less than that. When we get down to considering iron ore mines and most of the gold mines in Australia we see that the economic rent component is even less, although in the case of gold it is highly variable because of the vast range in the grade of ore which is mined and also-sometimes compounding with each other-the accessibility of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, on behalf of the Opposition I have moved the amendment to the motion for the second reading. We support the basic objective that the Government is pursuing with this Bill. We deplore the fact that the Government has chosen to do it in such an inefficient way. It is an error-I suppose one could charitably call it an error-which we seek to ameliorate to some extent by this amendment to the motion for the second reading.

         —This afternoon we are debating at the second reading stage the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1982. The present coal export duty applies to export of coking coal at the rates of either $3.50 per tonne or $1 per tonne depending on the quality of the coal and certain other features of the mining operation. At the moment there is no duty on steaming coal. The present rates are below those which applied when the Government came to office. But it is considered Government policy that it is no longer thought appropriate to phase out the duty, which was the original intention some years ago. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is to enact the Customs Tariff alterations introduced into the Parliament on 18 August 1981 by the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Proposal (1981) which formally proposed, with effect from 8 p.m. on 18 August 1981, an export duty of $1 per tonne on black coal previously exempt from export duty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coal industry faces a variety of charges imposed by the Commonwealth Government and by the various State governments. Unfortunately there is very little co-ordination in the implementation and imposition of the charges. For example, the Commonwealth Government collects normal corporate tax on company profits at the rate of 46 per cent and coal export duty at the rate of $1 or $3. 50 per tonne depending on the quality and depth of extraction. Also there is a component in relation to long service leave. Today we introduced a Bill to lift the limit from 15c to 25c to cover long service leave amendments. Then there are a variety of State government taxes and charges. For example, I will refer specifically to some of these charges imposed by New South Wales. In the case of coal there is a levy in the form of a royalty which is a charge by the State Government for the right to extract the coal. That is fairly normal. In addition to that royalty there is a super-royalty which is an additional amount based on what is called a minor project basis. Little or virtually no royalty is paid on marginal coal leases, whereas royalties on profitable leases can be quite high. There is a large element of discrimination.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a rail freight charge. The New South Wales Government, in common with practices adopted by the Queensland Government, extracts a form of levy, royalty or excise-whatever one likes to call it. It is an additional amount in the form of a rail freight charge. A supercharge is incorporated in that charge. In other words, there is a taxation component within the rail freight element charged certainly by the governments of New South Wales and Queensland. In addition, there is a ship loading charge and wharfage fees, which are quite high , and a harbour deepening charge. I think we are all aware of many of the problems the industry is facing, particularly in New South Wales. If one looks at the overall situation, one sees that in 1980-81 coal exports comprised 10 per cent of the total export income of Australia. We are now facing depression in economic activity and, unfortunately, I believe we are not helping ourselves a great deal in some areas. For example, I was told today that a vessel that entered the port of Newcastle to load coal had been waiting off the coast for 75 days. I suppose where there is an excess supply of shipping in relation to world demands ship owners possibly are prepared to leave ships off the coast for an average of between 30 and 39 days. That is intolerable. As world economic activity picks up, no ship owner will allow his ship to stay off the coast of New South Wales at an average cost of $10,000 a day for such periods.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a strong argument for an additional loading facility to be provided, not necessarily in the port of Newcastle with its high levels of congestion but somewhere else-say, Botany. I know there are some environmental problems there. Maybe the opportunity should be given to private enterprise to develop a facility like the one at Hay Point somewhere else down the coast. It would be necessary, of course, to have that loading facility connected to the main rail system. The problem is accentuated by high Commonwealth charges in some cases and exorbitant charges by State governments which are virtually reaping a levy in their own right. We may well say that this is not necessarily the best form of taxation, but if the Commonwealth moved out of this field what would happen? The States would immediately move in to take up the difference, and I think rightly so. From the Commonwealth's point of view there should be some adequate return to it. After all, we have to regard this not only as a State resource but also as a Commonwealth resource.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are problems with the coal industry at the moment. There are high levels of industrial activity, particularly in New South Wales. This high level of industrial activity is causing a degree of instability, sharp increases in costs , many of which have been brought about by government action, congestion in the ports and so on. One wonders whether in the long term the future exports of coal will essentially come from the State of Queensland rather than from the State of New South Wales. I think the employment consequences could be quite horrific unless all concerned combine to put their houses in order in New South Wales. The Japanese, Koreans and the Taiwanese will not indefinitely put up with unreliability of supply and higher than necessary cost structures. I can foresee a gradual movement towards the opening up of more mines in Queensland and the development of additional port facilities in Queensland unless the New South Wales Government and the colliery owners, the workers and the unions-the whole lot-put their acts together and try to develop an economic and viable export coal industry in that State.
       </para>
       <para>
        On top of that we now face an oil glut. Prices are falling. One may well ask: Will there be a tendency to move towards coal, particularly amongst the high energy, heavy industry countries such as Japan, Taiwan and Korea? The indications are that in Japan there is a move away from high energy utilisation industries to the application of manpower in high technology industries. Therefore, the growth in coal exports to Japan will not necessarily be at such an accelerated rate as in the past. I think development in this area lies very closely with Korea and Taiwan. But there is the general problem facing the industry throughout Australia, but particularly in New South Wales, of costs rising far faster than selling prices. It is true that lately there have been some increases in the selling prices of steaming coal, which proves that it is in demand, but Australia has to be able to prove that it is a reliable supplier. If we look to the longer term we must consider the impact that nuclear energy will have on the coal industry. Whilst Australia has fairly low reserves of coal -about 4 per cent of the world's reserves-its command of the trade is approximately 20 per cent, which is quite high. Looking into the longer term, if nuclear energy is utilised, there could be doubts about the long term future of the coal industry. We have to recognise that environmental difficulties are associated not only with the mining but also with the transport and storage of coal. With increased technology available in the nuclear industry, in the next 10 to 15 years we may well find that nuclear energy will replace coal energy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe there needs to be some consistency between the State and Federal governments in the application of the various charges and levies that relate to the coal industry. The imposition on some companies of the various charges is quite severe. For example, in 1981 the annual review of the Utah Development Co. stated its total income. The various governments' share was 72 per cent, leaving 28 per cent to the company. The review did not define the term 'income', but I think the figures, despite the lack of definition, are sufficiently high to cause some worry and concern. There is also a concern within the Utah company that certain discrimination is exercised against it. In terms of world trading conditions I do not think this is an appropriate form of taxation. A company which happens to secure a reasonable lease and uses modern techniques of extraction can suddenly find itself with charges which are far higher than those which pertain to the rest of the industry. There is also a great deal of uncertainty when one considers the whole ramifications of the coal export duty, because there are certain problems. I understand that one company at present has some disputation with the Customs section relating to certain technical features and to differences in technology between open cut and underground mining. In the international scene, potential investors must regard the position in Australia as a matter of some concern.

        I mentioned that the development of world markets for energy and resources and the consequent strengthening of export demands for steaming coal indicate that there is no great reason for differentiating between coking and steaming coal in the application of duty. However, I think we must also consider the problems that I raised earlier. I mentioned that the purpose of the Bill is to impose an export duty of $1 per tonne on black coal, which was previously exempt. Steaming coal, of course, is in demand because of the increases in the price of oil that occurred in 1979. While there is some temporary softening in the price of oil, it is difficult to see how long these lower prices will prevail. A lot depends on the political condition of many of those countries in the Middle East. It would be surprising if softening of prices extended very much more than six months.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the long term, we see that action is being taken by Saudi Arabia to reduce its flow of oil on to world markets. Despite the unreliability of some of the figures coming from some of those countries, there will be a determination to try to reduce the flow, to some extent, to keep the prices up. So in the long term there will be the continued tendency to move away from oil and move back towards coal as an energy source. I mentioned earlier-and I must emphasise this- that there is no point in having a coal export levy or trying to produce and to develop an industry if we are in a situation where these enormous delays in shipping virtually cut the very heart out of profitability and industry. There must be a way to overcome this dilemma in terms of congestion and industrial disputation. I stress that the cause of the industrial disputation needs a more thorough evaluation and analysis. I do not believe that the problems necessarily are caused by the unionists. The techniques employed and the lack of communication between management and men have all to be considered. There needs to be a greater effort by both the Commonwealth Government, which has a vested interest in this matter, and the State governments, to try to put their house in order or the full potential of this industry will not be realised.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have to recognise also that coal is going through a new phase of development . Currently we are exporting something like 39 million tonnes of coking coal a year and over 9 million tonnes of steaming coal. The industry will continue to expand, I believe, particularly in the area of steaming coals. This buoyancy is reflected in recent price increases that have currently come towards the steaming sector of the market.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned that our reserves are considerable. While our reserves are considerable, we control about 18 to 20 per cent of world trade in export coal. It is a valuable industry which I believe the Federal Government and State governments have a vested interest in trying to protect. While the other sectors of the mineral industry are suffering depressed prices-one only has to look at the areas of tin and copper-there is some potential for growth in prices for export coal. I repeat: We have a vested interest in seeing that this valuable industry develops.
       </para>
       <para>
        As honourable senators know, I have a vested interest in seeing that we have a high level of Australian ownership of these resources. I, therefore, quote from a study by Dr Folie of the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. He estimated that the present level of foreign ownership of steaming coal was about 38 per cent. He predicted that this will rise to 50 per cent in the next ten years. Are Australian shareholders really reaping the full value of this export potential? In the case of coking coal, Dr Folie estimates that foreign ownership is already as high as 60 per cent. Because of the high levels of foreign ownership, many companies within the industry find that their profits are being repatriated abroad or just built up for further development in other industries in Australia . There appears to be a need for a tax, such as the export levy, whereby a further contribution other than the primary tax which is charged at the rate of 46 per cent is added to the component.
       </para>
       <para>
        One also needs to examine some of the guidelines with investments. Some of the local companies, such as the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, in addition to some of the life insurance companies, are moving into this market. Their big problem is that the level of savings to provide capital is not sufficiently high.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe a greater incentive should be given to ordinary Australians to invest in our resource industries. This could be done by a number of measures, such as by exempting from taxation dividends of under, say, $400 or $500 earned from such investments. Such action would encourage smaller investors to invest in the market. Alternatively, we should be devising our taxation system to give a greater incentive, particularly to the local type companies, to invest. I believe that a lot of the depreciation allowances do not recognise the fact that this industry has to operate in a world environment. This criticism applies not only to the coal industry but also to the whole of the mineral industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In our taxation system we must develop not only incentives but also a recognition of revenue sources and make allowance for the fact that the proportion of taxation income does not necessarily have a relationship to the manufacturing industries that operate in a State. The taxation system should recognise the fact that these industries have to compete on the world market. There is a need for greater flexibility in depreciation rates. At the same time we have to recognise that a lot of the costs that are incurred by mining companies are not allowable as taxation deductions. There is, therefore, a tendency to call upon local government to supply some of the charges and services that should rightly be borne by the mining companies themselves. If we had a more appropriate or indeed more equitable taxation system which, for example, recognised the right of a company to deduct the costs of building a bridge along a highway as a taxation expense, there would be much more incentive for the companies to undergo these sorts of expenditures rather than relying on State or local government to provide these services.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a need for a complete review of the taxation system to provide greater consistency in relation to the collection of revenue from the coal industry. We must look at the whole taxation system so far as the recognition of revenue and the appropriate deductibility of expenditure are concerned. I support the tenor of the Bill. I wish it a speedy passage through the Senate.

         —One of the premier articles in today's Australian Financial Review is headed 'Coal boom buried by a cost-price squeeze'. The first sentence of the article reads:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The much discussed coal boom was finally buried at the third Australian Coal Conference on the Queensland Gold Coast yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the title and the whole tenor of that article and, indeed, the pronouncements on the health of the coal industry by Mr Bob White, the Chief General Manager of the Bank of New South Wales, and Mr Ray Craig, the Investment Manager of the AMP Society, are too gloomy by far. In fact, they do not take any account whatsoever-nor does the title of the article-of the fact that in the Senate chamber today we have one of the reasons why those involved in making investment decisions in the coal industry are feeling apprehensive. If there is anything that investment decision-makers require it is stability of the taxation environment in which they make those decisions. For example, on 18 August last year the Treasurer (Mr Howard) walked into the House of Representatives and announced out of the blue, without consultation with the industry, that a dollar levy would be placed on the export of lower-valued coals, principally steaming coals, formerly exempted from the coal export duty.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that the unpredictable and variable nature of the levies to which this industry is being subjected by the Federal and State governments is one of the reasons why there is some apprehension within the industry at the moment. It is most disturbing and, indeed, remarkable that the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) is not present while the Senate is debating the imposition of a levy on the export of coal from Australia, a levy which has been vehemently rejected by the Australian Coal Association, which represents virtually all the black coal producers throughout Australia and produces over 100 million tonnes of black coal. He does not even care to come into the chamber to defend the imposition of this levy. It seems remarkable that Senator Sir John Carrick should sit in his office while the Senate is debating the imposition of a tax on one of Australia's premier resource energy industries. But that is a measure of the contempt with which this Government has dealt with the coal export industry as a whole. I would have preferred the article in the Australian Financial Review to have paid heed to that fact rather than to talk only in terms of what it calls a cost-price squeeze and, as I say, speak in terms of doom and gloom, which seems to have been the pattern of that daily review of our financial affairs over the past fortnight or so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is, as honourable senators know, that the coal export industry stands on the verge of very substantial growth. In fact, it is a magnificent industry. The sorts of actions to which I have alluded and which we are debating of this Federal Government have created some problems with the investment decisions that need to be made. But there is no doubt that since and as a direct result of the decisions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries this industry is now a thriving and generally profitable one. Previously the Australian economy definitely rode on the sheep's back. In 1978, for the first time, coal passed wool as Australia's major export earner. On a long term basis, although wheat exports may be higher in good crop years, coal looks like being Australia's number one export earner over the coming decade. In 1979-80, for example, exports of coal were worth $1,667m. That is about 10 per cent of the value of all our exports. With exports continuing to rise at an expected rate of about 7 per cent a year and more in money terms as prices rise with international inflation, I think we can expect this industry to contribute a considerable degree of wealth to the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, we are unique amongst the world's black coal producers in that so much of our black coal is devoted to export. We mine about 100 million tonnes of coal a year. Half of it is for local use, particularly in our power generation and the making of steel. But the rest, which comes down to 45 million or 46 million tonnes after washing, is exported. This means that the industry is subject to international cycles in trade. Whilst steaming coal exports may be a little less volatile than coking coal exports, which are obviously related to the cyclical steel industry, nevertheless there is a judgment to be made by those who wish to invest in this industry as to the growth and future profitability of the international trade in which Australia is in a premier position. Largely, until now, we have devoted our coking coal exports to the Japanese steel furnaces. At the moment, we export per annum some 36 million tonnes of coking coal and seven million tonnes of steaming coal. That represents a dramatic increase in recent years, but is nothing like the tonnages of steaming coal that will be leaving this country during the next decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        It all sounds very promising for Australia. It is therefore important to ensure that this great industry and the various projects based on this wonderful natural resource with which we are blessed are managed by both the private entrepreneurs concerned and by governments in such a way that the return to the Australian people is fair and helps to distribute wealth in a way which increases the well-being of all Australians, not just those immediately connected with the industry, whether they be shareholders or the workers within the industry who demand quite high wages for their work within it. When one looks at the distribution of moneys from the coal industry one sees that governments are doing very well. In fact, the real profit earners in the coal business can be said to be States and Federal governments. In 1979-80 government earned nearly four times as much as the coal companies-in dollar terms, of the order of $600m against a net operating profit for the export coal industry of around $150m. That is a very considerable contribution directly to government revenues.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have seen a table which indicates the percentage allocation of coal export revenues. For example, for New South Wales the list is as follows: the State Government gets 15.6 per cent of coal export revenue; the Federal Government, 15 per cent; local government, 1.5 per cent; company profits, 3.6 per cent; employee after-tax pay, 26.3 per cent; State services, 14.6 per cent; Federal services, 1 per cent; other costs, 22.4 per cent. There is no doubt that when one looks at the wealth being distributed throughout the Australian economy as a result of the activities of the export coal industry one see that governments are doing very well. But the question is-this is the whole point of this amendment-whether the fiscal burdens imposed by Federal and State governments are, indeed fair and do create that predictable environment which, as I have said, is so necessary for the orderly and sensible decision-making of investors such as the Chief General Manager of the Bank of New South Wales and the Investment Manager of the AMP Society, two men who between them control by far the greatest investment power that could be marshalled in this country. This is a marshalling of the small contributions of many small policy holders in the AMP Society and those small savers with the Bank of New South Wales. They marshal these tremendous investment resources and they need to know that the fiscal burdens imposed by the Federal Government are indeed fair and predictable. I would say-I think any objective observer of the industry would say-that the coal export duty is not able to be characterised in that way. When one looks at that coal export duty one finds that its history is one of constant change culminating only in yet another announcement of an impost in the last Federal Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will remember that the coal export duty was originally imposed in the 1975 Federal Budget. At that time the Liberal-National Country Party coalition opposed that tax on the grounds that it was discriminatory and that it would sap the industry of capital for new developments. My submission to the chamber is that in that regard the Opposition at that time was probably right but perhaps we did not recognise it as quickly as we ought to have done. The duty was originally $6 per tonne for hard and semi-hard coking coals and $2 per tonne for soft coking coals. This was lowered to $4.50 and $1.50 in the 1976 Budget and further lowered to $3.50 and $1 in 1977 as the deleterious impact of the levy imposed at those rates by the Federal Labor Government became apparent. That is an admission which we make quite freely. We have learnt from the experience and have a proposal to make which we believe will overcome the distorting effect of that system of gaining revenue for the Federal Treasury from this great export industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1977 rate remained at that level in the 1978 Budget with the promise then made by this Government that the duty would be abolished on 30 June 1979. However, in the mini-Budget of May 1979 the Treasurer, Mr Howard, announced that because of the stringency of the Budget situation and the essential requirements to bring down the deficit the Government had decided to retain the duty. So once again, despite an environment where both sides of politics recognised that the duty was inequitable, harsh, distorting investment decisions and having an unfair impact on various producers with quite different mining operations, this Government has persisted with the coal export duty. In the 1979 Budget the duty, which was retained at the previous levels except for hard and semi-hard coking coal won by underground methods, was reduced to $1 per tonne, the same as for soft coking coal.
       </para>
       <para>
        In October 1979 the duty was varied once again. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, announced that the duty on hard coking coal won by open-cut method with an overburden exceeding 60 metres would be reduced to $1 per tonne. In addition, exporters of coal with an ash content greater than 12 per cent or a swell index less than 3 per cent would not pay the duty. Because of its high ash content this latter coal must be sold as steaming coal despite its coking properties. In other words, again in October 1979 the Government recognised the variability of the types of coal and the mining operations required to win it. Obviously there is a difference in costs in removing an overburden of 70 metres as opposed to an overburden of 10 metres. This had not been recognised. It was partially recognised in this sliding scale of October 1979.
       </para>
       <para>
        The then inevitably and, no doubt, without surprise to the industry on 18 August last year-on Budget night-the Treasurer announced that the Federal Government no longer considered it appropriate to phase out the duty. Because of developments in the world market for energy resources and the consequential strengthening of export demand for steaming coal, the Treasurer claimed that there was no longer any need to differentiate between coking and steaming coal. The $1 per tonne levy was therefore to be extended to cover all steam coal exports. It is that Bill with which we are dealing today.
       </para>
       <para>
        From that short history this chamber would have been made aware or would have been reminded of something of which it no doubt was already aware, namely, that this provides a very fragile environment indeed for the decision makers in the coal industry to commit the vast sums of capital that are required. The reversal of government policy in this sort of manner from time to time and the constant variations, without any warning or without any proper consultations with the industry which would be required, have had the most severe effects on the confidence of investing authorities. They have to get some reasonable return on their investments in the future. They do not know the tax regime under which they will be acting or exporting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators would know that the lengthy period from five years to eight years to commence production in a mine requires constancy of policy over the period if confidence is to be maintained. I believe that it is this lack of confidence, not arising out of the international trading situation which is good for Australia, but arising out of the variation in the taxing policy of this Federal Government in relation to export coal, which has created the sort of apprehension which is legitimate but which, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, does not justify the sort of heading in the article in today's Australian Financial Review.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party is firmly opposed to this type of levy. We say-as we have said before-that it takes no account whatsoever of the differing mining conditions and hence the profitability of the industry. Our proposal is to so tax the industry that there is a true recognition of the varying profitability of projects or companies as they are looked at in their individuality. One has to look at the different infrastructure capital requirements, the geological situation and how these all work out in the profitability of a particular project. It is that profitability to which taxes ought to be related rather than some levy which depends on some crude amounts either being exported or mined at the pithead.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that Senator Siddons for the Australian Democrats will be explaining in the course of his remarks the Democrats' proposal for a tax related to pithead production. But we say that even that, being related to crude quantities of coal being extracted from the earth, is just that-a crude method of levying a tax which bears no relationship to the profitability of the particular project. We say that it would be fairer for the coal industry concerned if indeed a tax varying with the profit were introduced. If that were the case then I believe that some of the investment projects for which feasibility studies have been done, which have been delayed because of the sorts of policy changes indulged in by this Government, could then go ahead.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will be well aware of the Labor Party's policy in relation to the resource rent tax. I have spoken on it at length in this chamber. Suffice to say that the Secretary to the Treasury finds nothing untoward when one is looking to return moneys to all Australians via some taxing mechanism which is fair, in the concept of a resource rent tax. Senate committees have found his remarks quite helpful in that respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the idea of a resource rent tax, I am surprised that it does not appeal to the Government on the simple basis, as I have said, that the coal industry finds the present coal export duty totally inequitable but, nevertheless, it must concede that, given the world energy situation, the higher profitability that might have been expected some years ago ought to enable it to contribute more to the Federal Treasury than normal company tax would return. If a resource rent tax were introduced by the Commonwealth I believe there would be several major gains to the Commonwealth in doing this. Firstly, there is little scope in raising ordinary income taxes as they are presently regarded as excessive by most Australians, whether one is talking about company tax or private individual income tax. So one cannot see any simple increase in those rates occurring. Secondly, the introduction of a resource rent tax is consistent with the Government's anti-inflation policy because the resource rent tax would not increase prices as indirect taxes would. The Commonwealth would easily be able to reduce the Budget deficit because of the larger potential of this particular tax. I think that this ought to be taken into account by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it would be a rash government which continued, in the face of industry protest, with the coal export levy rather than try to come to some agreement with the industry on how its high profitability, when it occurs in relation to a particular project, can be tapped by the Federal Treasury. I am not saying that finding a formula will be easy but I believe that, as opposed to what has happened from time to time over the past four or five years, what ought to take place is the fullest possible consultation with the industry as to how that high profitability might be tapped, as I said, by the Federal Treasury. Consultation is the key. I think it is a very worthwhile thing indeed that a Senate standing committee is presently engaged in a review of the Australian export coal industry with a particular reference to its contribution to the economy. Whilst I am not a member of that standing committee I believe that the senators who are involved will come to much the same conclusions as I have indicated in my remarks today.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, it is a cause for remark and somewhat disturbing that the Minister, who must have had much to say in the Cabinet room when the imposition of a further duty on steaming coal was proposed and who must have had more than his fair share of responsibility for the implementation of this proposal on Budget night of 1981, is not in the chamber this afternoon to defend this impost which has been rejected overwhelmingly by the industry, is rejected by the Australian Labor Party and, I believe, ought to be rejected by the Senate.

         —The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill gives effect to a Budget decision to place an export levy on certain types of coal previously exempt. It was estimated in the Budget Papers that the Bill would raise around $10m this financial year. It is planned that a total of $115m will come from coal export levies this year. The Australian Democrats support this Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the Senate. We are opposed to the amendment introduced by the Australian Labour Party, which in fact I saw only half an hour ago, for reasons which will become clear later during my remarks.

        Senator Tate outlined the great future the coal industry has in this country. We can only agree with him wholeheartedly. We believe that Australia's resource future generally is very great indeed and that levies, such as the one proposed in this Bill, offer a way of allowing ordinary Australians to reap some of the benefits of our vast and varied resources. Unless our resources are carefully planned and managed and their development proceeds at a rate that is compatible with capital generation in this country the benefits to most Australians from resource development will be very limited indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Resources which are mined, such as coal, are essentially non-renewable-once they are used they are gone forever. The most important issue, therefore, surely is their conservation. The Democrats believe that this should be done through the application of a tax on tonnage mined-a pithead tax-such as this Bill employs. A pithead tax is justified, we believe, on the basis that the minerals and the energy resources in this country belong to all Australians. As a sovereign state, Australia has a right to use whatever resources may be found in this country for the common good to aid our defence, to pay for the development of infrastructure and, most importantly, to finance continued development. The primary objective, therefore, of a tax on tonnage mined is to conserve non- renewable resources and to encourage the establishment and exploitation of renewable resources. The Democrats approach to doing this differs very markedly from the approach of the Labor Party. It also, I might add, differs from the approach of the Government in that the Government's record so far has been very piecemeal and has lacked any long term planning.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that applying a tax on raw materials used up-a pithead tax-and adjusting that tax to the level of the resources available, adjusting that tax to the local and world cost structures of the resources being sold, has a great advantage in that this sort of tax is trickeryproof in respect of companies exploiting transfer pricing. It could also take advantage of cost differentials in the mining of resources in various States. For instance, the costs of mining coal in Queensland by open cut methods are vastly different from the costs of deep mining in New South Wales. A pithead tax could take note of those variations in the costs of production and could be regulated accordingly. Anybody who thinks that much can be achieved by taxing profits is living, I am afraid, in a fool's paradise. If any honourable senator doubts this he or she should just carefully study the track record of the oil companies.

Excess profits also become very dangerous because they essentially encourage inefficiency.

        Where necessary, under our proposal of a pithead tax, the rates could be varied also to encourage the full exploitation of fields that are suffering from depletion and quantity differentials. I think Senator Tate said that such a tax would be extremely difficult to administer. I point out that the Government is currently applying such a tax in its levy on crude oil production. We say that this is the sort of tax that should be applied generally to all our mineral resources. The Government has demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach in its application of the crude oil levy. Of course, unfortunately, having successfully applied the levy on oil the Government is now proposing to phase it out since it has drawn a distinction between old and new oil.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, although it has been on the right lines, is running one other grave risk as we see it. It is running the risk of wastage on a grand scale by not directing the moneys that it is raising from the levy towards specific and clearly set out national objectives. We are, in effect, squandering our national capital. I have said in this chamber many times-I will continue to say it-that we must effectively plan on a long term indicative basis if we are to manage effectively the economy of this country. Long term planning in resource management is absolutely essential.

        Some members of the Government have stated that such a tax as the one envisaged in this Bill would inhibit the so-called resources boom. I think that was stated by Senator Crichton-Browne when he spoke on the tax proposed in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources on alumina. I say only that, if such a tax does inhibit a boom, that will be a good thing as most booms inevitably result in a bust sooner or later. Surely what we have to do in this country is to develop carefully our resources in the long term to ensure that enough is left over for future generations and, most importantly, that Australia is not continually straining the demands for capital. We believe that the Federal royalty payments should be abolished and that these should become part of the levy or pithead tax, as we have been advocating. State royalty payments will undoubtedly continue, as it is unlikely, in the short term at least, that the State governments will forsake them. However, in taxing mine or field production a total tax should be imposed. From the producer's point of view, it should be one figure. The Federal Government could then readily vary the revenue sharing formula between States to pick up the differentials and take note of existing State royalty payments. In summary, the Australian Democrats position is that we must oppose the Australian Labor Party amendment to introduce a super tax on profits as being impracticable in the sense of achieving anything, being inhibiting on companies and encouraging inefficiency in companies.

         —Yes. I believe that the constitutionality has already been demonstrated in the imposition of the levy on crude oil. It can be done. It is not an uncommon method of applying a tax on resources. I conclude simply by saying that there should be a tax on mine production of both mineral stocks and energy stocks based on world prices, the size of the field and the richness of the ore body.

         —The Opposition will oppose this legislation for reasons which I will state at a later stage. What the Canned Fruits Marketing Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 1982 and the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1982-they should be taken as a package-seek to do is to increase the levy imposed for the funding of the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation from its present 11c to 27c a basic carton which, if I remember correctly, is 24 30-ounce tins or whatever the metric equivalent is. The levy is now collected and is proposed to be collected in the future from canneries. It is sometimes disputed, in situations such as this, who actually pays the levy, whether it is the processor upon whom it is normally imposed-if only for simplicity and ease of administration-or the supplier of the product. I have always thought that because of the way markets for such agricultural products are structured there has never really been any doubt that the levy is paid by the supplier of the raw material, in this case the fruit growers. But in any case it is not relevant in this instance because all the canneries are co- operatives and are therefore owned by the growers. They share in the profits or losses more or less pro rata to the amount of fruit which is processed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are opposing the levy Bill because we have grave reservations about the Corporation's competence. The writing for this industry has been on the wall for some time. But it has accumulated and continued to accumulate last year huge stocks which are the immediate cause of the current crises. It is at least legitimate to ask the question whether the money currently being paid by growers to support the Corporation is substantially being wasted, let alone to ask whether the growers should increase their contributions to fund the Corporation. Amongst other things that suspicion is fostered by the fact that the Corporation , despite the desperate position the industry is in failed to lodge a submission before the current Industries Assistance Commission inquiry, unless that situation has changed in the last couple of weeks: This leads in turn to the further question: Is the Corporation so bereft of ideas about the industry's problems or so bereft of understanding the industry's problems that it has nothing to say to the IAC? If that assumption is wrong, that is, that the Corporation is justifying the financial support it is receiving compulsorily from growers, we submit that at least for the present the Government ought to pay the increased costs of funding the Corporation.

        A government which can find $300,000 to finance a propaganda campaign for its discredited housing policy in a last ditch attempt to save a discredited, decaying Liberal government in Victoria ought to be able to find a lesser amount of money for the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation. This Government allows its department of propaganda, which it euphemistically calls the Government Information Unit, to have apparently open-ended access to the public purse for the employment of loyal toadies of the Liberal Party such as Mr Verbickis for such worthy activities as spying on the challenger of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-Mr Peacock-and reporting very promptly back to the Prime Minister, as if that has anything to do with communicating to the public information in which it has some interest and an entitlement to know about. This of course, is the ostensible reason for the existence of the Government Information Unit. It employs loyal toadies, such as Mr Verbickis, to spy on the Prime Minister's rivals for the deputy leadership of the party and promptly report back.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, I had finished making the point anyway but with your indulgence I would like to explain the relevance of it. The point the Opposition is making in opposing this Bill is that at least for the time being-regardless of whether the Government disagrees with us or is satisfied that our reservations or doubts about the worth of the Corporation are groundless-it ought to fund the increased requirements of the Corporation from general revenue, given that the Government seems to be able to find any amount of revenue to fund the activities of people such as Mr Verbickis. So I think the point I was making does have some relevance to the Bill. If, as John Kerin said in the House of Representatives when the Bill was discussed there two months ago , the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation improves on its past record we, that is the Australian Labor Party, will review our attitude as to whether growers ought to pay an increased levy to fund the Corporation's operations.

        As I mentioned earlier, the industry is at present in a state of crisis. There is a gross oversupply. Orchards are producing fruit which cannot be sold at anything near its production cost and, in the process of producing that fruit, are contributing quite significantly to the saline pollution of the Murray River and much of its valley. That absurd situation is the end product over 30 of the last 33 years of Country Party dominated coalition Government policies. It is a sad testimony to the party which claims to have real expertise in this area.

         —Unlike Senator Walsh, I support the legislation and what it proposes to do. There has been a quite considerable delay since the Bill passed through the House of Representatives on 18 February. However, the position is clearer now that the canning season has concluded. I am surprised that the Opposition is still opposed to the legislation. That opposition is certainly contrary to the industry's position and requests and it is in spite of the advice that has been obtained from the industry and from the best sources available. At the time we last got close to debating this matter-I think it was on 23 March-I received communications from the growers in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. I think it would be appropriate for the wishes and desires of the growers to be presented. From the Victorians I received a telex which stated:

       </para>
       <para>
        These levies are paid by canners and are used by the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation to fund its operations and to promote Australian canned fruits on all markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        This levy is collected at a per basic carton rate on production in each fruit season, such seasons covering the period December through April in each.
       </para>

        It is imperative that the levy be collected and provided to the Corporation to enable it to carry out its vital role within the industry.

        We reiterate that the levy increase has the full support of the growing sector of the industry and any move by senators to amend or reject the Bills as they stand would be contrary to the wishes of the industry concerned and viewed most unfavourably by that industry.

        I do not know what advice has been obtained that would give members of the Australian Labor Party the impression that they know more about the canned fruits industry at the moment than do the growers. Senator Walsh rightly summed up the situation by saying that it does not really matter whether we say that the growers should pay the levy or that the processors should pay the levy because, as the growers run the co-operatives and the co-operatives comprise the growers, it is all the same anyway. Which pocket the levy comes out of is neither here nor there, but it is the wish of the total industry that this money be provided. There is no dissension from the top to the bottom of the industry as to the necessity for the amount of money that is being sought. There are only four processors-one in South Australia, one in New South Wales and two in Victoria. They all handle similar lines of fruit and operate at the same time of the year. They all agree that it is imperative for their survival that they be able to fund their operations in this way. It is not government funding; it is not a government tax. It is industry money and it is spent by the industry. The only way in which government is connected with it is that it is raised by government authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The intake question is important. It is a fact that this year's intake figure is only 50 per cent in round figures of last year's figure, because of the very poor selling season in 1981. The levy is to cover the 1982 crop all of which, as I have said, is already harvested and canned. Last year there was a surplus of about 2,500,000 unsold cases. This year about 4,000,000 cases will be processed, leaving a total of about 6,500,000 for sale throughout the year. Last year some 8,000,000 cases were processed and only a portion of that number was sold. This year, with 4,000,000 cases having been processed, 6,500,000 should be adequate to meet what the requirements look like being. Although half the amount of fruit has been processed this year in comparison to last year the costs of promotion and of running the organisation will be similar to those of last year. If only half the amount of fruit has been processed the levy naturally will have to be double what it was last year. I think that would be fairly obvious to anybody.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last time the legislation was before the Parliament it was said that one of the reasons for objecting to it was that it represented taxing something that had already happened, that we were going to delve back and raise a levy from 1 January. That was alleged to be a very bad thing. I think the fact that the legislation was not passed by the time that the fruit started to be picked is neither here nor there. We are still talking about the 1982 crop and the need for running the industry through to next season. For instance, as from 4 April of this year the industry has been running a $350,000 advertising program in Sydney. Advertisements have appeared on television, in magazines and so on. This money is absolutely necessary for the industry to be able to maximise its sales in its own markets. The levy of 27c per basic carton, in case it has not been made clear, is a doubling of the 11c provided by the previous legislation for advertising, plus 3c for promotion and 2c for administration. The amount of 27c is accepted as being adequate to assist this industry, which is struggling very hard, to survive.
       </para>
       <para>
        The industry is doing everything it can to improve its position. I think its management, organisation and operation are doing it considerable credit. I think it certainly does nobody any good to try to cry it down at a time when it is in extreme difficulties for a whole variety of reasons, very few of which are its own responsibility. I thought that Senator Walsh's comment that, if the legislation were not passed now and it was shown to be necessary, the Opposition would review it later was really a very inadequate remark. Of course, if the legislation is not passed now there will not be any later. If the industry goes broke as of now for failure to get the funds that are necessary for it to survive until next month then I point out to Senator Walsh that I am afraid that waiting for another Bill to come in so that we can consider it will be of very little value.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the Opposition to say that it is not approving because it lacks confidence in the organisation again is looking for an easy way out when the organisation that is there represents every grower in this industry in Australia. They are all represented, every one of them. They have made their decisions. They have appointed the best people possible. They have obtained the best advice they can get. Whilst I as a Tasmanian have no direct influence on the industry in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria-not one of those gentlemen engaged in the industry is an elector of mine-I have been to the growing areas on several occasions. I have done everything I can to try to provide assistance where possible. I will continue to do so. I certainly trust that we can pass this legislation, which is what the industry requires, without any fiddling, fuddling or taking a stance. I hope we can pass the legislation forthwith. I support the Bills.

The fact that those various bodies are unanimous in supporting an increase in the levy from 11c to 27c a basic carton I believe must be taken note of if one is to be concerned about retrospective legislation. The principal objection to retrospective legislation is the imposition of a penalty backwards, whereas if it were not retrospective legislation that penalty would not have been applied. I think that principle, however, does not apply in this case because the people who will be affected by that are in agreement with having that levy imposed upon them. Therefore, we will not be pressing any amendment in relation to retrospectivity in regard to this piece of legislation, although in general we will be opposed, as always, to retrospective legislation that does not have that type of unanimous support from the people upon whom the legislation will be imposed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The industry wishes to make use of the levy and, as Senator Archer has already pointed out, it will not amount to very much more than what happened in the 1981 canning season. The canning season traditionally stretching from Christmas to a little into April has, in most cases, now concluded. However, the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation has already embarked on its advertising program, presumably spending money that it hopes to receive from the passing of this piece of legislation. I think that is an unfortunate position for the Corporation to be in. Indeed, I had hoped that this piece of legislation would have been passed before Parliament rose for the Easter recess. I think that with some judicious shuffling that could have been achieved. I believe it is unfortunate that the Corporation has been put into these circumstances of embarking in hope, no matter how well-grounded that hope may be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, I think it has to be said in regard to this piece of legislation which bears to some extent on the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation that the Corporation's activities in the past few years have not been above criticism. Indeed, I am pleased to see that the Corporation has accepted the types of criticisms that have been levelled against it and, in its own reorganisation, has sought to come to grips with the problems, some of which have been of its own making in the last two or three years. I think the Senate certainly wishes to give every support to our rural industries of which the fruit growing industry is probably one of the best examples in terms of problems that we are running into, particularly as it is not one of the industries we could expect in the foreseeable future to have a bright and profitable outlook. Its markets are not secure and all projections are that the Corporation must look more and more to the domestic market to satisfy its output. We hope that the money from the increased levy that the Corporation will be using will be put to good use and that the employment of that levy will, indeed, at least secure the industry as it is now operating and will mean that it is in a viable position. We hope that if at any stage in the future new markets do appear-of course, part of this levy will be used to try to expand those export markets-the Corporation will be in a position to take advantage of those markets. We will be supporting the Bill.

         —The Senate is debating the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill in a cognate debate with the Canned Fruits Marketing Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill which relates to the marketing of canned fruits. I will confine my remarks to the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill. I agree with my colleague, Senator Walsh, who said that we will be opposing the imposition of this increased levy. Senator Macklin who has just resumed his seat and Senator Archer said that the levy would assist the industry, but I am not yet convinced that this levy will in any way assist the industry. As a matter of fact, it will have a detrimental effect on the industry. Despite the fact that the canneries are co-operatives, the growers just do not have the wherewithal to withstand the onslaught of this increased levy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Archer in his opening remarks quoted some correspondence which he had received from various officials of the industry in the various States. He quoted correspondence he had received from Mr Deakin, the Chairman of the Riverland Canning Fruitgrowers Association, but I did not hear him cite the date when that correspondence was sent to him. I must have missed that. I would very much doubt whether the date of that correspondence was after the recent hearings of the Industries Assistance Commission into the Australian canned fruit industry. My understanding is that Mr Deakin came away from that inquiry after having listened to the Chairman of the Commission castigate in no uncertain terms the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation for the way it conducts its business. I also have not received any communication from people in the Riverland saying that the growers in the Riverland were ever called together to have a meeting to discuss this increased levy. I do not know with what authority Mr Deakin sent that correspondence. He certainly did not send any to me as a South Australian although, apparently, he sent correspondence to people on the Government side. I , as a member representing South Australia, have had no communication. Of course , Mr Deakin under the charter of the Riverland Canning Fruitgrowers Association may be able to call an executive meeting and make a decision. One of my colleagues in the other place in speaking to this legislation said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Growers in the Riverland have been contacting us continuously complaining that they cannot get their leaders to convene a meeting with them so that they can express their concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no information that in fact a meeting of growers was convened. I am at a loss to say whether Mr Deakin was speaking on behalf of the executive of that association or whether he was speaking on behalf of the growers. I will try to ascertain that next week. I agree with the other speakers in the debate who said that the canned fruit industry-I will refer only to the industry in my own State because I am more conversant with it-has been going through very traumatic times for many years. Whilst this Government has been prepared at various stages to make loans available, the loans do not get these people out of trouble. I well remember that when we were in government and the former Senator Wriedt was Minister for Agriculture we saw that loans would not help the people; so we converted over $1m, I think, of a Commonwealth loan to a direct grant to try to help the industry. Likewise, the South Australian Labor Government, under the premiership of Mr Dunstan, also converted a loan to a grant to endeavour to help the industry. I noticed in today's Advertiser that the South Australian Government has now made $280,000 by way of aid available to the Riverland growers. An article in today's Advertiser states in part:
       </para>
       <para>
        The chairman of the SA Canning Fruit Growers' Association, Mr J. Deakin, said the announcement was 'fairly disappointing' and most growers considered the loans a non-event.
       </para>
       <para>
        Growers had hoped for Government grants to ease their plight.
       </para>
       <para>
        In February growers threatened not to pick peaches and pears unless the SA Government agreed to pay more than the new minimum prices fixed by the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The prices were $180 a tonne delivered for peaches and $130 a tonne for pears, a reduction on last year's prices of $45 a tonne and $30 a tonne respectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        The growers said the lower prices combined with reduced tonnages to be processed under quota would mean they would receive only about 40 per cent of their previous year's income.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have evidence from Mr Deakin himself that the stone fruit growers in the Riverland area of South Australia in a desperate plight. Not only will they be in a desperate plight, but also small business and local government will be in a desperate plight. I have received correspondence from the Riverland Local Government Association expressing its grave concern as to what will happen if the growers embark upon a treepull scheme, as a result of which production will drop even though at present we do not have a market. I understand that something like four million cartons of canned fruit, a carryover from last year's season, are in store and cannot be sold. There is a problem also in South Africa where there is a glut crop. South Africa is eating into some of the markets in which we hope to gain some recognition.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am somewhat surprised, in view of the fact that the Riverland Local Government Association would have written to members of the Federal Parliament who represent South Australia and who expressed their concern, that not one South Australian senator from the Government side has spoken in the debate on this legislation. It might be that Government senators had their fingers burnt a few years ago when Senator Teague spoke on the brandy excise which was increased by about 83 per cent. He is on record as saying that he would not be a credible Liberal if he did not voice his objection to what harm that impost would create for the grape growers in the Riverland. When the crunch came, Senator Teague, like all his colleagues, voted for the legislation, and that has had a detrimental effect in the Riverland. That might well be why we do not hear any South Australian senators speaking about the plight of the industry and voicing their concern. It has been left to Senator Archer, the sole Government speaker, to represent the Government.

         —The Government Whip said that he is a strong speaker, but of course Senator Archer did admit that he represents a State which has no financial interest at all in the canned fruit industry because fruit is not canned in Tasmania. I do not know why Senator Archer was put up as a stop-gap speaker. I am not criticising what he said. At least he admitted that he comes from a State which has no problems with canned fruit. The State that has the very serious problems is not represented in this debate by a speaker from the Government side showing some concern about these people in the Riverland. I received a letter from Mr E. J. Commane, the Secretary of the Riverland Local Government Association. Accompanying this letter is a copy of a submission that the Local Government Association made to the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry. The person who was handling this submission was Mr Donald Rex Elliott from Waikerie, a fruit grower. He said that the submission was presented on behalf of the Riverland Local Government Association whose members are the district Councils of Barmera, Berri, Loxton, Morgan, Paringa and Waikerie and the Corporation of the Town of Renmark. That document clearly sets out all the problems which the Local Government Association considers will arise if the canned fruit industry in South Australia collapses. Of course we all know that the cannery at Berri is in receivership at present. I could speak for an hour as to what caused a lot of the problems there in the last couple of fruit seasons, but time does not permit me to do that. A detailed outline of the problems besetting the industry is set out in the last year's December issue of the State of Agriculture which is a monthly report issued by the Department of Agriculture in South Australia. I will not quote the article now because time does not permit. In the February issue there is further reference to the problems associated with the industry. Again in this month's issue we find further mention of the canned fruit peach harvest. A small paragraph states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The canning peach harvest now completed resulted in a final cannery intake of 5 ,400 tonnes, just over the target quota. Quality was fair to good, but recovery rates were somewhat lower than last season. Final intakes were on 24 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        We know the quota for this season was well below what could have been delivered had the growers had a market for their fruit. Unfortunately, that market does not exist. There was one stage, after the quota had been set, when the cannery thought it may not get enough fruit to fill the quota. Of course a lot of the fruit that was available was not suitable or was not wanted at that time. It was certainly suitable for canning, but the cannery did not want to take that in and at one stage it looked as though it would fall short of the quota. As pointed out in the State of Agriculture journal the industry exceeded its quota by a small margin.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should like to advise the Senate that the Labor Party in South Australia is very concerned and has been concerned for many years. It has done its best, in more ways than one to try to assist the industry in the Riverland. Through our previous Minister for Agriculture, who is now the shadow Minister, we have done everything possible to try to assist the industry. Mr Chatterton, on behalf of the Rural Committee of the South Australian Parliamentary Labor Party, made a very strong submission to the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry. That submission details the matter far better than I could off the cuff and without looking up a lot of references. In that submission Mr Chatterton set out the problems that beset the industry and also listed some of the recommendations which he considers should be implemented to try to solve its problems. I showed the submission to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) and he agreed that, rather than take the time to read the submission, it should be incorporated in Hansard. I seek leave to have the submission incorporated in Hansard.

        This submission is concerned with adjustment assistance for cannery fruitgrowers, canneries and cannery workers affected by the market downturn for canned fruits. Other submissions will explore the extent of the market downturn and the degree of adjustment that will be necessary in the industry. We have addressed ourselves to the problems of adjustment within the rural communities engaged in growing and processing fruit for the industry. We have assumed from our discussion with other parties to the enquiry that the reduction in the industry will be substantial.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. Need for additional adjustment assistance
       </para>
       <para>
        Pressures for adjustment in agriculture can be divided into adjustment-push and adjustment-pull.
       </para>
       <para>
        Adjustment-push occurs when prices are depressed, production cannot be sold and payments are delayed. This history of the canning fruit industry over the last decade shows that there has been no lack of adjustment-push pressure on growers to leave the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Adjustment-pull is provided by industries that are prosperous and that attract growers with their opportunity for greater profit. The winegrape growing industry provided considerable adjustment-pull in the early 1970s but has now lost this due to excessive production and discounting at the retail level.
       </para>
       <para>
        The traditional horticultural industries cannot provide adequate adjustment- pull for the canning fruit industry. Additional assistance is needed to foster new industries and crops to provide the necessary adjustment-pull. The present rural adjustment scheme only provides for the change from one established industry to another and is inadequate when new industries have to be developed.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Justification for additional adjustment assistance
       </para>
       <para>
        The lack of alternative enterprises which provide adjustment-pull is slowing down the rate of adjustment in the canning fruit industry. This slow rate of adjustment is causing:
       </para>
       <para>
        4.1 Severe hardship to growers, workers and rural communities that are dependent on the canning fruit industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        4.2 Low profits on fruitgrowing blocks and extra cost to the community. Drainage and irrigation rates do not pay the full cost of the community investment in the irrigation and drainage infrastructure. Additional contribution to this commitment is only obtained if growers are profitable enough to pay tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that these reasons are sufficient to justify additional adjustment assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        5. Short Term measures
       </para>
       <para>
        The most severe impost on growers and the local communities will be during 1982 when it is likely that nearly half of the fruit produced will be surplus to market requirements. Short term assistance can be provided to growers through carry-on loans but without further long term measures these are not likely to be taken up by growers on a large scale.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unless growers are able to answer the question 'carry on for what?' they are not likely to commit themselves to further borrowing even at favourable rates of interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Carry-on loans can be extremely successful (see Appendix I) where they are provided in a form that meets the farmers needs, where they have been 'sold' to the rural community as an acceptable management tool, and where there is a long term future for the enterprise that is being supported by the carry-on loan.
       </para>
       <para>
        These conditions were met during the 1975-77 drought in SA where $23m of carry- on loans were provided to 1300 farm families. The winegrape carry-on loan scheme provides a contrast. The major portion of funds provided have not been used because growers could see no reason to continue borrowing while their future markets remained unsure. The winegrape carry-on scheme was only available to keep growers in the business of winegrape growing. To be effective in the canning fruit industry carry-on loans would have to be linked with long term measures that allowed growers to answer the question 'carry-on for what?' with optimism.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. Long term measures
       </para>
       <para>
        6.1 Adjustment-push
       </para>
       <para>
        The depressing future prospects and the history of uncertainty in the canning fruit industry provide strong incentives to growers to leave the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        This adjustment-push pressure can be reinforced through assistance in the form of tree pull grants for growers to reduce productive capacity. We do not believe that this measure alone will provide an adequate incentive for adjustment to take place at a desirable rate but we believe it should be provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tree pull assistance provides an immediate and tangible form of assistance which demonstrates concern for the problems of the growers. We recommend its adoption as part of a package of measures designed to improve the rate of adjustment.
       </para>
       <para>
        As explained in Appendix 1 the SA Government continued to provide drought assistance through measures such as freight subsidies which were considered a marginal value because to withdraw such assistance would have removed psychological support to the community and increased levels of stress.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be remembered that the process of adjustment is not merely a relocation of physical resources but includes a whole community. Adjustment puts that community under stress.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.2 Adjustment-pull
       </para>
       <para>
        Without alternative crops or enterprise for growers to develop on land now devoted to canning fruit tree pull alone will not provide sufficient incentive. The rate of adjustment will be slow and the hardship created in the community very considerable. There is no single traditional crop or enterprise that can provide sufficient adjustment-pull for all canning fruit growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The citrus industry is currently the most profitable established alternative but the large area of citrus coming into production over the next few years is a cause of concern and sufficient reason not to encourage further expansion in that industry. Winegrape growers have been told that over production and discounting will lead to a reduction of winegrape acreage in the near future. The solution must be to provide a range of new crops and enterprises that can as a group provide the adjustment-pull that is required by those growers forced to quit the canning fruit industry. The present rural adjustment scheme is not well suited to fostering new crops or enterprises and we recommended changes on the following basis:
       </para>
       <para>
        6.2.1 The Present Scheme
       </para>
       <para>
        Originally the rural adjustment scheme was introduced to assist the wheat-sheep industry that was going through a period of severe marketing crisis in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Debt reconstruction and farm build up were the two forms of assistance available. Later it was argued that farm build up was not always appropriate in horticultural areas where two run down blocks would be twice as unprofitable as one. A more appropriate strategy would be to redevelop a block to raise productivity levels through replanting, better irrigation, etc. This form of assistance was included in the scheme in the mid 1970s.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.2.2 Eligibility
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently the rural adjustment scheme occupies the marginal area of rural finance as a lender of last resort. To be eligible for rural adjustment loans it is necessary for the applicant to be refused funds from commercial borrowers. The applicant has to be assessed as commercially viable before the application is approved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The result is that the present scheme caters for the marginal groups of producers whose enterprises do not produce a profit at commercial rates of interest but can show a profit at concessional rates of interest. A grower with a declining rate of profit from a property must show considerable judgment on the timing of lodging an application. Some growers have been refused assistance on the grounds that funds could be obtained commercially and as little as a year later have been refused on the grounds that their enterprise is not commercially profitable even with concessional loans.
       </para>
       <para>
        We recommend that this eligibility criteria is removed for the canning fruit industry. This could be done by amending the relevant State and Commonwealth Acts to allow for the proclamation of 'Priority Adjustment Areas' in which the scheme could operate without the requirement that the applicant is first refused by a commercial lender. Such a proclamation would be regularly reviewed and revoked when the special adjustment needs of the industry had been met. Such a procedure already exists for invoking the carry-on loan provisions of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not expect that such a relaxation of the eligibility criteria will result in a great flood of applications. The depressed state of the industry makes it very unattractive to commercial lenders and is not difficult for growers to obtain the refusal of their bankers. Such refusal does have however an adverse effect on their confidence and they feel that it gives them a community image of a failed producer.
       </para>
       <para>
        By making them directly eligible for finance their confidence to go into other activities is better and they avoid the humiliation of a commercial refusal.
       </para>
       <para>
        An additional advantage of this proposal is that it would allow the State Department of Agriculture officials the opportunity of 'selling' to growers a complete adjustment package which included finance. Currently they provide mainly technical advice on how to change from one enterprise to another. Their role in encouraging adjustment would be greatly strengthened if they could carry their involvement to the financial aspects of adjustment planning for individual growers. We believe that the need for 'selling' funds has not been given sufficient emphasis by administration of rural adjustment schemes and the lack of 'selling' explains why the demand for loans, in spite of their comparatively low interest rates, has in many cases been surprisingly low.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.2.3 Types of Assistance
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently rural adjustment assistance is provided in the form of loans with long term and concessional interest rates. This is adequate where the adjustment is to a traditional industry where returns are reasonably predictable-at least.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have already said that these traditional industries have no room for those who must adjust out of canning fruit production. In the case of new developments , which we believe are essential to provide the canning fruit growers with adequate adjustment-pull, the returns may be high but the risks are also high. Growers will be reluctant to adjust to a new enterprise unless the risk can be reduced. They fear the possibility of repaying a loan over many years from the profits of their remaining enterprises when the loan was taken out originally to launch a new enterprise which subsequently crashed. This would be particularly true of smaller growers and is common throughout the world where risk minimisation is often more important than profit maximisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We recommend the following changes to the Rural Adjustment program:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) Loans for farm improvement and debt reconstruction. Currently this is the section of the rural adjustment programme that is of major significance to horticultural producers. Long term loans are provided at concessional rates of interest under this scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that the subsidy component of the scheme should be re-arranged to provide much greater benefits to the grower in the early years of the loan and fewer in the later years. This could be done by providing 'suspensory' loans in which the interest in the early years is subsidised to an extremely low level or remitted altogether and the capital repayments are postponed. In later years the interest reverts to normal commercial rates and the loan is subjected to five- yearly reviews which can result in a speeding up of the rate of repayment.
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) Risk sharing arrangements for new ventures. We recommend that the authority should have power to make arrangements with growers to share risk on an equity participation basis. These agreements would be similar to sharefarming arrangements. The major difference would be that NET returns would be shared between grower and authority, not GROSS returns as is the practice with current sharefarming arrangements. In most cases we anticipate the grower would supply land, labour and water to the partnership while the authority would provide working capital required to equal the agreed value of the grower's resource contribution. Any capital required over and above that amount would be contributed equally.
       </para>
       <para>
        There should be provision for the grower to buy the authority out at any time on an agreed basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) Market Development Financial Assistance. The development of new crops and enterprises that are needed to provide adjustment-pull is closely related to the development of markets. In some cases domestic markets already exist and are supplied by imports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The replacement of these imports can be a simple marketing exercise if Australian production prices are competitive. A notable recent example of such an exercise is the development of an industry now providing coriander seed for local and export market. However in many cases, any replacement of imported canned fruit and other lines will require effort to be put both into production and marketing simultaneously and therefore the authority should not be precluded from providing funds for market development.
       </para>
       <para>
        We recommend that the funds should be provided to merchants or co-operatives willing to develop such markets on the same basis as they are to growers-i.e. either 'suspensory' loans, or a share the risk/share the profit basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        6.2.4 Administration
       </para>
       <para>
        We recommend that the administration of the modified rural adjustment scheme should be carried out on a regional basis. This would give administrators a better understanding of regional problems and make the scheme more accessible to growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        We suggest the following administrative structure:
       </para>
       <para>
        * Regional Enterprise Board consisting of three part-time members to decide applications for loans, sharefarming agreements and market development schemes. Membership of the Board would change fully every three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        * Support group of assessors and financial managers to investigate applications for decision by the Board and to manage applications that are approved. This simple administrative structure could be achieved by redeploying existing positions involved in the administration of rural adjustment. The major difficulty would be the selection of suitable personnel to fill those positions. Currently the Rural Assistance Branch lacks the capacity to assess innovative new developments and it is difficult to find suitable people within the public service. The assessment of marketing projects poses even greater difficulties as Australia is notoriously poor at marketing agricultural produce. It would probably be necessary to recruit staff from overseas-possibly New Zealand which has had remarkable success in developing and marketing new horticultural crops.
       </para>
       <para>
        7. Cannery adjustment
       </para>
       <para>
        The adjustment problems of the canning fruit industry cannot be solved purely at the production of fruit level. The problem extends to the processing sector of the industry where depressed levels of throughput substantially increase the share of overheads paid by each unit of production.
       </para>
       <para>
        As growers receive the residual amount after processing costs any further decline in the industry. It is quite possible that the industry could enter a downward spiral in which each increase in costs and retail prices would reduce market demand and so reduce production even further.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of options:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) One option would be to close one cannery and process the fruit through the remaining canneries at high levels of throughput. This has already occurred in South Australia. The JON cannery in Adelaide was closed and the production transferred to the RIVERLAND cannery.
       </para>
       <para>
        As both South Australia and New South Wales only have one cannery each now, Victoria should act to ease the problem of rationalisation facing the whole industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) Another option is to diversify into other products to spread the overheads over a larger overall production. This has been done by some canneries but the scope for further diversification into 'other' products is limited.
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) Reduction of overheads is a further option that should be considered. This option needs to be examined further for the Riverland cannery. By putting the cannery into receivership, the South Australian government has substantially reduced the capital overhead of the cannery which is now valued at $2 1/4m. The effect of this on the total overheads should be examined.
       </para>
       <para>
        7.1 Redundancy payments for cannery workers
       </para>
       <para>
        Faced with a situation where a decline in cannery production is inevitable we recommend that compensation be paid to workers made redundant by adjustment in the processing of canned fruit. We believe that it is inequitable that the Rural Adjustment Scheme should be providing 'non repayable' loans to growers who voluntarily adjust out of horticulture while equivalent assistance is not available to workers who are equal victims of the same economic pressures. We recommend that the present provision of 'non repayable' loans be extended to workers in the cannery.
       </para>
       <para>
        7.2 Regional employment
       </para>
       <para>
        The rural communities which will suffer from the downward adjustment in the canning fruit industry provide limited alternative employment opportunities. Decentralisation of industry and employment has not been strikingly successful in Australia and in any case is beyond the scope of this inquiry. We do, however , believe there are some opportunities for agro-based processing in the region that would provide alternative employment to displaced workers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The opportunities for each industry may be small but collectively they could provide a substantial number of jobs. We recommend that the Regional Enterprise Boards be given sufficient powers and funds to invest in downstream processing that flows from new enterprises they foster in the growing sector. For example if they assisted a herbal tea growing industry or flower and vegetable seed production industry, they should be able to assist the establishment of local packing plants for those products.
       </para>
       <para>
        8. Confidence in the canning fruit industry
       </para>
       <para>
        With the depressing market projection for the industry and the substantial reduction of production that will have to take place to balance supply with profitable market requirements, there is a danger that the residual industry will lose more ground than is necessary because of a lack of confidence in its future.
       </para>
       <para>
        8.1 Canning Fruit Corporation
       </para>
       <para>
        Now that the Canning Fruit Corporation has been given wide powers over the marketing of canning fruit it must be looked at critically and performance benefitting the industry must be demanded.
       </para>
       <para>
        8.1.1 Foreign Imports
       </para>
       <para>
        We are concerned at the apparent indifference of the Canning Fruit Corporation and its canning industry members to the successful penetration of the Australian domestic market by Californian, Italian, Dutch and French products. These products could be easily produced in Australia if the Australian industry had the inclination to develop the expertise. A recent example of foreign penetration where we already have the expertise is Leetona brand canned tomatoes grown and processed in Italy seen in supermarkets in August 1981. A visit to suburban supermarkets and ethnic food shops will show shelves of 'specially' canned and bottled fruit from California (in particular) and European sources selling to Australian consumers at premium prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        8.1.2 Pack Quality
       </para>
       <para>
        An opinion gained from discussing the matter with consumers indicates that the quality of the fruit pack currently sold on domestic markets as sugar free should be upgraded. Without added sugar, the lack of flavour of the fruit becomes obvious. This lack of flavour is due to the degree of ripeness of fruit delivered for processing. At present firm fruit is demanded and sugar content is low. We recommend that sugar free packs be continued, but that fruit quality be lifted. The present requirement for delivery of 'firm' (that is, slightly coloured) fruit relates to ease of handling. Alternative methods of handling will be required if the prime fruit necessary to better consumer levels of acceptance is to be provided. Falling sales on domestic markets often mean that the consumer has lost interest in the product for negative reasons. Talking to consumers will readily reveal consumer attitudes and enable production and marketing adjustments to be developed. This exercise should be part of the CFC responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        8.1.3 Penetration of export markets
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian canners have failed to penetrate the markets of the Arabian Gulf and the Middle East. Our observations of these markets show that a major reason has been poor presentation of canned fruit to these markets and a lack of market research. There are some very successful Australian exporters to these markets such as Anchor Foods and Sarah Lee. We believe the Canning Fruit Corporation should allow companies such as these with a proven performance on these export markets to act as agents for Australian canned fruit. This would require a relaxation of the Corporation's policy on agencies and would no doubt require permission to be given to allow the agents to sell canned fruit under their own label. We believe that greater efforts in these markets would be more worthwhile than the current futile effort to sell canned fruit to EEC countries for a profit. It should be noted that when Spain and Greece take up mooted EEC membership the competition in terms of production will be greatly increased. In view of the EEC situation, the decision to send five members of the Canning Fruit Corporation to a trade fair in Hamburg should at least be matched with a similar expenditure in market exploration in North Africa, the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should not be thought, however, that these Arab markets will provide a potential bonanza, nor should their potential be used as an excuse for postponing adjustment decisions. Markets will only be developed with patient and persistent effort. If a market is developed and further production is required, this could be supplied from the re-development of the residual fruit producing areas where productivity has fallen due to lack of confidence among growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        9. Research capacity
       </para>
       <para>
        The quality of canned fruit from Australian canneries needs to be improved and new products developed which take account of the growing concern within the community about excessive consumption of sugar. The quality of the domestic pack also needs improvement so that canners can retain the domestic market which has become increasingly important to the industry as the export market has diminished. The industry cannot afford to ignore the high priced market for ' special' products packed in glass, for instance, that is currently supplied by imports. There is some evidence that these products are expanding the market for processed fruits to consumers who would not otherwise purchase canned fruit products. In putting forward this area of concern we are drawing a parallel with the Australian cheese industry where foreign imports succeed because of the unwillingness of Australian manufacturers to produce various types of cheese.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to successfully carry out a strategy of competing with foreign imports , it will be necessary to expand the research capacity into canned fruit.
       </para>
       <para>
        A full scale research institute modelled on the Wine Research Institute is probably not justified but we do recommend that the canneries and the Commonwealth Government jointly provide funds to CSIRO or colleges of technology to train cannery managers in the technology necessary to produce products similar to the imported special lines currently on the market. When the Australian industry has caught up with technology advances overseas further research would be justified.

         —I think that covers all I want to say on this matter and puts the Australian Labor Party's point of view. There is one other matter I want to mention; that is the announcement of the loan which has been made available. I refer briefly to a letter to the Murray Pioneer of 25 February this year. The letter is signed by Mr I. Cunningham of Renmark and it concerns a carry-on loan. Mr Cunningham is a grape grower who sought a loan. He set out the problems which beset growers when they accept loans, small as they may be. He stated:
        </para>

       <para>
        Sir-When the wine industry was in financial trouble, a few years ago, I was forced to take a carry-on loan.

       </para>
       <para>
        That is a problem that besets these growers when they take a loan from the Government. The banks will not then accommodate them irrespective of the size of the loan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Cunningham continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr. Deakin seems to think the loan will be made into a grant in time, but from my experience the growers will still have to pull out their trees and replant.
       </para>
       <para>
        He continues on that aspect. I will not take the time of the Senate by reading it. He points out the dangers and the problems that confront growers when they accept loans. I am afraid that, if growers accept these loans, or a portion of them, which are made available by the State Liberal Government-some of them as low as $300, which will not take them very far-they will find that the maximum loan which any grower will get, from my hurried reading of the paper today, is about $10,000. The person who accepts between $5,000 and $10,000 certainly will not be accommodated by his bank because the Government will have some mortgage over his property. He will be hamstrung in that respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst I am talking about fruit, I make mention of another article which appears in today's Adelaide Advertiser. It mentions that a South Australian man has been appointed to the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. I express my delight that at last South Australia has a representative on the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. I well remember standing in this Parliament on several occasions and making a strong plea to Mr Nixon to give recognition to South Australia and Queensland. This was after I had received representations from Mr Lockier who is the secretary of the growers organisation in South Australia. I am very happy that the announcement has been made that each State has a representative on the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. That can only do good as each State will have a voice. I hope that the States will now be happy and that they will be able to put their point of view without having somebody in another State representing them. I have not had a look at the composition of the Board. I do not know how many of Senator Archer's apple growers are on the Board. They could have one. The Opposition is opposing the increases in the levy. I think that, with the effluxion of time, we will be proved correct.

         —Firstly, I address myself to a few remarks made by Senator Walsh in respect of the Canned Fruits Marketing Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 1982 and the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1982. In particular I draw attention to the fact that he said that the Government had given no evidence to the Industries Assistance Commission in its recent headings with regard to the canning fruit industry. The Government provided extensive written information in the form of a statutory declaration to the IAC last February. Furthermore, it gave oral and written evidence to the public hearing held by the IAC on 15 April. I am a little at a loss to know where Senator Walsh's information is coming from. I guess it is a little like most of the information which he presents to this place. It has extremely doubtful value.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Archer illustrated very well the case for the levy. He pointed out very strongly the wide support within the industry for the levy. That, of course, is critical to an understanding of the Bill and the need for increased marketing expenditure. The industry well understands the position of the industry. The particular problems of certain canneries in the River Murray area and their ongoing difficulties as they reconstruct to match the market situation which is changing all the time, is well known in my own State of South Australia. Senator McLaren referred to this aspect. The interstate situation and the varying conditions between the States also have a very big bearing upon the viability of individual canneries in the various States, as we all understand. Again, Senator Archer referred to that very strongly and pointed out the difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most pertinent points that Senator Archer made was that the Australian Labor Party will continue to monitor and to review the situation with regard to the levy. He clearly pointed out that there may well be no 'later' for this industry. The marketing proposal, as it is being carried forward now, is indeed very significant in the development of the industry. I thank Senator Macklin for his support of the legislation. He rose chiefly to make the point in connection with retrospectivity. I understand that he had very real worries in that connection before Easter. Whereas the legislation is, in fact, back-dated to 1 January of this year I make the point that in fact announcements were made in this connection, in making the position clear in respect of growers' potential levies, back in November and December. It did not come upon the industry out of the clear blue sky. There was some expectation that this would occur.

         —Senator Archer points out that it is a grower based levy and does not represent a general tax or any kind of support from the Government. Senator McLaren referred to some of the problems of South Australia. I think he, myself, Senator Elstob, Senator Teague and many other South Australian senators would be well aware of the representations that have been made to us and by us to the Federal Government and indeed to the State governments in those matters. He made one point which was a little difficult to follow. He spoke of a constituent who had some difficulty in obtaining finance. It caused him some concern that the banks had, in fact, knocked him back-which was the expression he used-when he tried to obtain finance. It is a fundamental feature of this adjustment system that the adjustment scheme represents a source of last resort in seeking finance in order to make these kinds of adjustments. An essential feature of it would be a refusal by a bank to finance. Consequently a situation of eligibility for the kind of finance which is distributed by this form of assistance is created. We all recognise the problems in the canning fruit industry. They have been well canvassed in this debate. I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I am sorry that the Australian Labor Party does not see fit to support the levy Bill. I commend both Bills to the Senate.

Consequently, those expenses would be met out of the normal proceeds of sale in those circumstances.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, in recent weeks the Leader of the Opposition in the House has taken the view that the terms of reference of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and the Commonwealth-N.S.W. Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking were inadequate to allow investigation of all allegations of unlawful activities of the Nugan Hand group of companies. He indicated a strong preference to have a new Royal Commission established for this purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the House has been informed by the Prime Minister on many occasions, the Government envisaged at the establishment of the Stewart Royal Commission, the possibility of an extension of its terms of reference to cover other drug trafficking groups. It felt that this approach ought to be tested before any consideration was given to the possibility of a new Royal Commission. The Minister for Administrative Services wrote to Mr Justice Stewart informing him of developments and the House resolved to send the Hansard of the debate to the Royal Commissioner. Furthermore, the Commonwealth's law officers were asked by the Prime Minister to examine the documents which Mr Hayden tabled in the House on 25 March and the allegations concerning Nugan Hand made in the House and the Senate, as well as a letter to the Prime Minister from Mr Hayden, with a view to ascertaining whether the matters raised warranted an extension of the Stewart Royal Commission's terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Officers have formed the opinion that an extension of the terms of reference of the Royal Commission is warranted to cover allegations of:
       </para>
       <para>
        Nugan Hand's involvement in drug dealing, beyond any association with the Clark group;
       </para>
       <para>
        Nugan Hand's laundering of money, and association with organised crime;
       </para>
       <para>
        interference with earlier investigation of Nugan Hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having regard to the nature of the matters identified by the Law Officers as requiring further investigation and their relation to matters already under investigation by the Stewart Royal Commission, the Government does not think it appropriate that a new Commission should be established. A further inquiry into these matters will be best handled by the Stewart Commission under extended terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        Extension of the Royal Commission's terms of reference to cover Nugan Hand would be consistent with our announcement on establishing the Commission that the terms of reference might need to be supplemented to cover other drug trafficking groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also consistent with the need for a wide and impartial inquiry into all aspects touching Nugan Hand, including those reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 March 1982 of evidence given to investigators that Nugan Hand supported and was used by persons and organisations across the political spectrum. There is a need for even-handedness in action to be taken by the Government in this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has made a decision, subject of course to the views of States who have granted concurrent Commissions, that the terms of reference for the Stewart Commission should be extended as recommended by the Law Officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister has written to the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland to seek their support in principle to the proposed extension of the terms of reference. The letter raised the need for agreement by at least New South Wales of a parallel extension of its Commission to consider breaches of State Law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has noted the Law Officer's conclusion that the need for a specific inquiry into any foreign intelligence agency links has not been established. There have been firm United States denials about CIA involvement with Nugan Hand. The Government intends, however, that the extended terms of reference will be wide enough to allow the Commission to investigate Nugan Hand links with any organisation. The Commonwealth has always taken the view that all persons involved in criminal activities affecting Australia, regardless of whether they are members of any organisation, should be thoroughly investigated with the aim of establishing their involvement in drug trafficking or other crimes.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Minister had indicated to the House, the Government has had repeated assurances from the US Government that there was no connection between the CIA and Nugan Hand. On 26 March 1982 the Public Affairs Division of the CIA took the unusual step of issuing a statement responding to allegations about links between Nugan Hand and the CIA and operations by the CIA against the Labor Government. It emphatically denied those allegations. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the text of a cable handed to the Government by the US Embassy referring to the statement by the Public Affairs Division of the CIA.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, in response to a recommendation from Mr Justice Woodward in his Further Report into Drug Trafficking and on the Commonwealth's initiative, the terms of reference for the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking were widened to enable it to investigate the evidence concerning Nugan Hand and persons associated with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Volume 1 of the Joint Task Force Report deals with the activities of Murray Stewart Riley, Harry Wainwright and some related drug matters. The draft press release submitted by the Joint Task Force with Volume 1 and incorporated in Hansard by the Prime Minister on 18 March outlined the reasons why the Volume should not be made public. As foreshadowed to the House, the Prime Minister did, however, make a copy of the report available to the Leader of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government has now considered and accepted the recommendations in Volume 1. Specifically, the Government has:

       <para>
        endorsed the action proposed for the reference by the Joint Task Force of available evidence, information and relevant papers, concerning the activities of persons named, to the relevant Commonwealth and State Crown Law or other authorities so that consideration can be given to the preferment of charges or other appropriate action-such reference is, I am advised, now well in hand;
       </para>
       <para>
        endorsed the proposed reference by the Joint Task Force of relevant information and papers-concerning drug importation routes, unregistered gaol visits, avoidance of the preventative screen by corruption, and sale and purchase of property-to the relevant Commonwealth and State authorities for appropriate action; and
       </para>
       <para>
        agreed that Volume 1 and, where necessary, supportive material be distributed by the Joint Task Force to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the AFP Bureau of Crime Intelligence.

       <para>
        The Royal Commission's extended terms of reference will ensure that it has ample scope to investigate and report on all matters of concern to Australia arising out of allegations made in relation to Nugan Hand. The Royal Commission will be assisted in its work by the decision recently announced by the Treasurer that the Government has decided to amend the income and tax law to allow it to be given information held by the Australian Tax Office.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister is writing to the Leader of the Opposition in the House advising him of the Government's decision on extension of ther terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission. He is informing the Leader of the Opposition that, subject to agreement of the Stewart Royal Commission and the Joint Task Force, he or his Deputy Leader may peruse the relevant files of the former Narcotics Bureau. Those files, which are in the custody of the Royal Commission and the Task Force, hold originals of documents tabled in this House by the Leader of the Opposition on 25 March 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let there be no doubt in any mind that the Government is resolute in its intention that there should be the fullest possible investigation into the allegations of unlawful activities by the Nugan Hand organisation and persons associated with it in those activities. Moreover, let there be no doubt that the extended terms of reference will make it possible for the Stewart Royal Commission to examine exhaustively all matters regarding Nugan Hand of concern to Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the House has already been informed by the Prime Minister and the Minister on a number of occasions, the Government has been open and frank in its handling of this matter and had referred all the files to either the Joint Task Force or the Stewart Royal Commission. The Prime Minister and the Minister also appealed to the House and to all persons that if they have any information or documents relating to the activities of the Nugan Hand Bank, they should come forward to produce that information and documents to either the Joint Task Force or the Steward Royal Commission. The Government repeats that appeal again today.

        Nugan Hand raised in the Representatives on 11, 16, 17, 18 and 24 March, 1982 (Hansard House of Representatives, pages 890-927, 959-960, 976-988, 1033-1034, 1127-1131 and 1313-1314). We have read as well a copy of a letter dated 25 March , 1982 relating to a re-examination of the Commission's terms of reference from the Honourable Bill Hayden to the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser C.H. M.P.
       </para>
       <para>
        We think that the material and allegations in the tabled documents and the passages from Hansard above set out warrant an extension of the terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        In our opinion the terms should be so drafted as clearly to authorise, for example, an inquiry by the Commissioner into the allegations of Nugan Hand's general involvement in drug dealing as opposed to such dealing only when in association with Terrence John Clark; into the allegations of a general laundering of money wrongfully obtained or wrongfully concealed from the Australian authorities and into allegations of cooperation with organised crime.
       </para>
       <para>
        None of the papers tabled support an allegation of trafficking in arms. There is nothing to suggest public disquiet on the question. We think that in the absence of some credible evidence to suggest it or a sense of positive public disquiet the terms should not be extended to include arms trafficking.
       </para>
       <para>
        The transcript of the television interview of a former Narcotics Bureau agent contains statements that Michael Hand was understood to be either an ''ex-CIA operative or a current CIA operative'' (Hansard House of Representatives, page 924) and that other people connected with the CIA were within the Nugan Hand organisation. The basis for this, as for similar suggestions in one of the tabled documents, nowhere appears. The imprecision of the statements and their hearsay basis hardly support an extension in this regard of the terms of reference.
       </para>
       <para>
        Suggestions of Nugan Hand's involvement with foreign intelligence agencies have appeared from time to time in the Press. The sensational nature of the allegation is, no doubt, in part responsible. But apart from allegations in the tabled papers of Michael Hand's and Bernard Houghton's association (in the main spoken of in the past) with foreign intelligence services, there is no real evidence to support Nugan Hand's involvement. The additional reference to a retired United States Admiral (former head of an Intelligence Group with which Hand of Houghton or both had worked) as employed by Nugan Hand or a subsidiary does not carry the matter further. Nor do references to attendance at meetings called for commercial purposes of retired high ranking members of the United States Defence forces. Their engagement in commerce is hardly unusual.
       </para>
       <para>
        While it is open to the Government to extend the terms to include Nugan Hand's alleged involvement or cooperation in its illegal activities with foreign intelligence agencies, on the present material we are unable to advise it to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hayden's letter says ''it is essential the Commission enquire into allegations that Government officials and/or Ministers inhibited or attempted to inhibit investigations into all or some Nugan Hand activities''. Material which could suggest such action by a Government official, although not by Ministers, is contained in the papers tabled by Mr Hayden and allegations to that effect have been made in the Representatives and during a television interview, the transcript of which is incorporated in Hansard (H. of R.) of 11 March, 1982 at p . 924. The terms of reference, we think, should be extended to include this allegation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether they should also extend to allegations concerning Ministers is more doubtful. The suggestion is that some Minister other than the then responsible Minister gave the direction to confine the investigation. The issues would therefore be, was any such direction given, and, if so, by which Minister from amongst all those in the Ministry? It is open to serious doubt whether general allegations of this gravity against, in effect, any, perhaps each, member of the Ministry should be submitted to a Royal Commissioner. Nonetheless, the terms should be widened, as we have said, to include whether a Government official improperly sought to confine the investigations. A term of reference raising the question whether any person improperly interefered with, or sought to confine, the investigation would allow inquiry into whether a Government official did so as well as permitting inquiry into a specific allegation against a specified Minister, past or present. Such a term is, we think, sufficient for the present circumstances.

        The Opposition Labor Party has produced documents alleging narcotics links between the collapsed Nugan-Hand Bank and the CIA. There are also resurgent charges that CIA engaged in operations against the Labor Government in Australia several years ago. Comment: The Agency rarely comments on such allegations but in this case we emphatically deny these charges; the CIA has not engaged in operations against the Australian Government, has no ties with Nugan-Hand and does not involve itself in drug trafficking.

         —I wish to speak to the motion. The Opposition finds the statement which has just been put down by Senator Peter Baume quite inadequate in respect of the problems that exist concerning the Nugan Hand organisation. We believe-there is empirical evidence to sustain our view-that the Nugan Hand organisation is one of the most insidious groups that has developed in Australian political and social life in the post-War years. If it had not been for the strenuous efforts of the Opposition in the Parliament or for the sterling work of the National Times in particular-the work of Brian Toohey and Marian Wilkinson-the sordid story of Nugan Hand would have remained untold and unknown.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In recent weeks, as a result of documents that have become available to the Opposition, it has become clear that this organisation has been playing a subversive and nefarious role in Australian political and economic life and that it has exercised influences far in excess of the normal activities of a trading organisation. As a result of Mr Fraser's attempts to overcome the difficulties in which the Government finds itself in respect of the allegations that have been made concerning Nugan Hand both inside and outside the Parliament the Opposition finds the Government's response completely and utterly inadequate. Consequently this ministerial statement is nothing more than an attempt at a superficial approach to the problem that exists concerning this organisation. For example, it recognises that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, has indicated a strong preference for the establishment of a new royal commission. We believe that the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force into Drug Trafficking were completely and utterly unable to do the sort of job that was necessary. The Government states that all it intends to do, on the advice of its law officers, is to extend the terms of reference of the Royal Commission to cover allegations of Nugan Hand's involvement in drug dealing beyond those associated with the Clark group. Of course, that shows how narrow the original terms of reference were as they dealt substantially with Terence Clark and his association with Mr Asia. The Government now at least accepts the fact that it should go beyond that . The Government further states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Nugan Hand's laundering of money, and association with organised crime;
       </para>
       <para>
        Interference with earlier investigation of Nugan Hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course the Government is forced into this position as Mr Hayden, in a substantial contribution in the House of Representatives, and I several weeks ago in this place, indicated by reading from documents that came from the former Federal Narcotics Bureau that the Government knew as far back as 1973 that an organisation associated with Nugan Hand required some investigation. But it was not brought to the attention of the Government until October 1975 when the Narcotics Bureau reported. Honourable senators should have no illusions as that was only a couple of weeks before the coup in which Kerr and Fraser were involved in bringing down the Whitlam Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is abundant evidence in the material and the documents that are available to the Opposition to show that the terms of reference should deal with at least another eight or 10 issues rather than limit them to those three that the Government has finally been forced to concede. For example, it does not deal with tax evasion and currency manipulation-allegations that have been made in the newspapers. It does not deal with the association of Nugan Hand, and those connected with that organisation, with law enforcement agencies. It does not deal with the infiltration of political parties or with that organisation's involvement with other intelligence agencies including our own. It does not deal with the problems that this company had with its foreign links. It does not deal with the allegations made as recently as only a month ago in the National Times about the Nugan-Mafia link. It does not deal with gun running, an involvement which a number of newspaper articles have shown that this organisation had. It does not deal with the involvement of Nugan Hand directors with some of our respectable banks and with other so-called respectable business leaders in our community.

We are still insisting-as Mr Hayden has insisted-that a royal commission should be set up to inquire into all of the aspects and the activities of this Nugan Hand organisation. Yet we are asked to agree to those three simple additions and not these other areas which have been covered very considerably in a series of articles in the National Times and the Sydney Morning Herald over the last two or three years.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If we look at an article in the National Times of 21 February of this year written by Brian Toohey and Marian Wilkinson we find:
       </para>
       <para>
        The story of the investigation of Nugan Hand is one of timidity alternating with dissembling at the highest levels of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence of involvement by the 'dirty tricks' side of American intelligence in Nugan Hand is overwhelming. Yet Australian authorities have frequently refused to investigate the potential breaches of our espionage laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article goes on to make this allegation:
       </para>
       <para>
        Early last year the task force supplied ASIO with a list of Nugan Hand personnel suspected of having intelligence involvements. The then head of ASIO, Judge Woodward, replied on May 21 in a letter marked Top Secret.
       </para>
       <para>
        Woodward said that ASIO knew of only two people on the list related to the intelligence world. One was the former head of the CIA, Bill Colby, while he said another, whom he refused to identify--
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States of America stated in a communication from the United States Embassy that it had nothing to do with the overthrow of the Whitlam Government in 1975 and had nothing to do with Nugan Hand. Yet this Government, which is supposed to be concerned about protecting our independent position in world affairs and is supposed to be concerned about criminality and subversion in our country is prepared to accept the CIA's refusal to admit its involvement. Does anybody in this Parliament, anybody on any side of politics, anyone in the community at large, really believe that the Central Intelligence Agency will admit to any espionage? It never does until it is drawn before the United States Congress where, if one reads the testimonies of those investigations, one will find that the CIA has lied, bribed and murdered influential government figures all over the world. This is seen in the testimonies of the heads of the organisation which was brought before the Bar of the American Parliament. Yet the Australian Government accepts the word of the CIA that it was not involved and has not been involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is the CIA not concerned, for example, about the American bases that are in Australia? Has it not got an interest in them and, does it not therefore play a part in attempting to influence governments, oppositions and public opinion about the use of these bases in the event of war? Anyone who believes that the CIA is not involved lives in cuckoo-land. Anybody, of course, who knows anything about politics knows that the Central Intelligence Agency is very much involved in Australian political affairs. It is involved in the trade union movement in our country. It is involved in my political party. It is involved in the National Country Party. It is involved in the Liberal Party. It is involved in every aspect of social life in our country. Anyone who believes otherwise does not understand the ways and the role of an intelligence gathering organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Government suggests that it is not appropriate to establish a new commission it is not accepting its responsibilities. The Government refers to the fact the the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 March 1982 states that evidence was given to investigators that Nugan Hand supported and was used by persons and organisations across the political spectrum. Of course it was. Mr McDonald was involved with Nugan Hand. Mr Dowd came to Canberra three or four years ago. As a matter of fact I sat next to him in the dining room and heard him talking to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) about Nugan Hand. I did not know then what the details were. I heard him referring on several occasions to Nugan Hand and its involvement with the Liberal Party and other organisations. I know that it is involved also with my political party. I know, therefore, that it is a very subversive organisation. In fact, there is sufficient evidence in all of the articles in the National Times to prove the point to my satisfaction and certainly to the satisfaction of my party that there are people involved in the Nugan Hand organisation who were active members of the American Central Intelligence Agency. As we have seen in recent times as a result of Mr Hayden's debates in the House of Representatives and as we have seen in the last few days there are people in the various echelons of the Public Service who are prepared to make information available. The Government knows this. Therefore, it has backed down from the obstinate and scornful position that it occupied when Mr Hayden first raised this matter in the House of Representatives.
       </para>

        Just what did the National Times say in another article this year? The National Times states:
       </para>
       <para>
        On February 12, 1972, Maurice Bernard Houghton stepped off Qantas Flight 575 at Sydney airport and was stopped by immigration officials. Houghton, a US citizen, had no re-entry visa. It had expired three months before.
       </para>
       <para>
        But there was no problem. Houghton had two Australians he could call on for assistance. The immigration officer scribbled on his report: ''Vouched for by Mr Charody of Parkes Development--
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that Parkes Development Pty Ltd and Sir Paul Strasser and other supporters of the Liberal Party have been very much involved in profit making in land development; obviously Charody was a sufficiently important person to be able to vouch for a person like Mr Houghton when he got off the plane-
       </para>
       <para>
        and Mr Leo Carter ASIO''. Carter was the NSW head of ASIO (the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation).
       </para>
       <para>
        Houghton's passport was stamped ''A''-he could stay in Australia as long as he wanted.
       </para>
       <para>
        What sort of preferential treatment is given to a person like this gentleman who it was freely admitted in discussions that Brian Toohey had in the United States is a top operator of the Central Intelligence Agency? Let us look at the other people involved in the organisation-General Ed Black, Admiral Vasey, Admiral Yates, people involved in the Swiss/Pacific Bank Trust Co. which was later changed to the Nugan Hand Bank, all generals who fought in the Vietnam war, all generals who have had association with the American intelligence organisation. Of course, it is interesting that Michael John Hand, who is the other part of Nugan Hand, was a United States citizen who came to Australia and was naturalised. We see this American influence in this organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        What does the Australian Narcotics Bureau say? It is not included in the terms of reference. That is why I suggested that the CIA's involvement with the Narcotics Bureau should be one of the issues it would certainly be essential to consider if there were to be any proper inquiry into this organisation. Brian Bates said in 1978:
       </para>
       <para>
        I desire that this Bureau should not for the time being engage in any active external inquiries into this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, of Nugan Hand. That quote is from a letter sent to the Commander of the Eastern Region with copies to the Commander, Southern Region, C.I. (N.E.), C.I. (I.E.). I do not know what those abbreviations mean. I gather they are some abbreviations for organisations within the Bureau. The letter continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . I wish this to remain purely an Intelligence gathering and holding matter, oversighted from Canberra by Mr Haydock-Wilson, OLIA, to whom subsequent information reports connected wih the matter should be directed by Regions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Will you please, therefore, ensure that, until further notice from me, no active external inquiries are embarked upon in relation to this matter . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        We have another bit of paper from the Narcotics Bureau, again addressed to the Commander of the Eastern Region which is headed 'Subject: Nugan Hand Ltd. Suspect principles of heroin importations'. When Mr Hayden raised this matter in the House of Representatives he was taunted and criticised by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) who suggested that he was on some sort of witch hunt. Now the Government is being forced to concede that there is substance in the release of these documents which are available. This document puts the finger right on the question of drug dealing. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The original information that Frank Nugan and Michael Hand were financing the importation of heroin was received on 3.5.77 and is contained in folios 1 and 3. Preliminary enquiries showed that Nugan Hand Ltd and a number of its associates: Leslie Collins, Robert Pike, John Norton, Graham Dempsey had come to the notice of the Narcotics Bureau in October 1975 (folios 30 and 31). Both Nugan and Hand travel extensively throughout South East Asia and Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Nugan Hand Ltd, is supposed to be a merchant bank--
       </para>
       <para>
        Nugan Hand had very close associations with merchant banks in our country-I will not name the banks; that will obviously come out in due course--
       </para>
       <para>
        with a turnover in 1976-77 of $220 million. A BCI check shows that as at 12.7.77 Nugan Hand had made seven importations from Hong Kong and China, five being canned foods, one of furniture and one of golf clubs and balls.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a number of other documents. The one to which I have referred is signed by Phillip Bailey and is dated 14 November 1977. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        If Nugan Hand Ltd, is involved in the drug business it is most likely as either a behind the scene financier of drug importations or as a means of laundering the money made from drug sales. The second possibility should take into account the information received on folio 65.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt, as we have found in respect of the unfortunate happenings involving two Ministers, that things are going on in departments which require a great deal of investigation. We are far from satisfied that the extended terms of reference will in anyway lead to an unravelling of the web of conspiracy that is clearly part of the Nugan Hand organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We find it difficult to understand, for example, the treatment given to Mr Volkman who was formerly employed by the Bureau of Customs. The Attorney-General instituted proceedings against a number of former officers of the Bureau of Customs. The matter was dealt with in the Court of Petty Sessions in Sydney more than 18 months ago. Mr Nash found that there was no case to answer. Mr Volkman had suggested in discussions with fellow officers that a cover-up was taking place in respect of Nugan Hand. One is therefore entitled to ask why the Government is persecuting Mr Volkman to the extent that there is now an ex- officio indictment against him and four or five other people. It will involve a hearing of six or seven weeks in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The maximum penalty is $1,000. That seems to us to indicate a degree of vindictiveness and an attempt to get square with some officers who have suspected the involvement of Nugan Hand and who have given information over the years to various persons in their organisation about what they believe the Nugan Hand organisation has been doing.

       <para>
        The OLIA summary No. 2 on Nugan Hand states:
       </para>
       <para>
        2. During the period covered by this summary, four significant points/events are noted:
       </para>

        (a) Nov. 1977, Mr Dowd MLA was contacted by a Mr Peter WILCOX, and WILCOX was subsequently debriefed by this Bureau . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) Nov. through Dec. 1977, there was significant press reporting mainly of an adverse nature upon the NUGAN/HAND companies, as distinct from the NUGAN group based on Griffith, N.S.W.
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise the distinction between the Nugan Hand companies and the Nugan group based on Griffith in New South Wales. The summary continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) Jan. 1978, James McCRUDDEN, a solicitor, alleged drug trafficking involvement by the NUGAN/HAND interests. (This information may have come from 'D ' Investigator VOLKMAN.)
       </para>
       <para>
        He is the very person to whom I have referred who has been penalised and punished to a point where one wonders what the Government's objective is. The summary continues:

        (d) Feb. 1978, registered informant 2010 starts providing information in relation to NUGAN/HAND and their possible involvement in drug trafficking.
       </para>
       <para>
        One is entitled to ask on the basis of this evidence which is in the hands of a government agency why we restricted the Royal Commission headed by Mr Justice Stewart to dealing with drug trafficking, Mr Terence Clark and Mr Asia. Why was it not at the outset a royal commission into drug trafficking? I understand that we in the Parliament all have a common position, that is, we want to eradicate drug trafficking and corruption of our police forces and citizens that is so much synonymous with the drug movement in our country. All political parties have expressed that point of view. The information I am talking about was released in 1978 before the Stewart Royal Commission was established. Yet the Government-I say, delib- erately-narrowed the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission to deal with only one aspect of what is clearly a major criminal activity in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The summary further states:
       </para>
       <para>
        3. During this time the Bureau, both in Canberra and in Sydney, has consciously limited its investigations in this matter to background checks of an overt nature. Checks have of necessity been made in response to the points/events which have arisen during the period . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The summary details a number of other aspects which I do not think are relevant to this debate. Interestingly enough, at the bottom of the page, it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In Sydney-checks re biodata/identification of HOUGHTON (first-mentioned in this context by WILCOX).
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Houghton is the person whose status was accepted by our officers at Mascot Airport on the say so of some of our leading business and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation representatives in Sydney. One can say only that this attempt by the Government to extend the terms of reference to three other matters is nothing more than an attempt to whitewash the involvement of the Nugan Hand organisation in drugs, intelligence and political activities in this country. We do not accept the Government's assurance that it is satisfied as a result of statements made by the United States Government that there is no connection between the CIA and Nugan Hand. We do not accept the statements made by the Central Intelligence Agency itself that it was not involved in some of the nefarious activities that led to the overthrow of the Whitlam Government. We do not believe that it is sufficient to endorse the proposed reference by the task force, which deals with the activities of Murray Stewart Riley, Harry Wainwright and other related persons, to include relevant information concerning drug importation routes, unregistered gaol visits-who gives a damn about unregistered gaol visits-avoidance of the preventative screen by corruption and the sale and purchase of property. That is not what Mr Hayden and I have been saying about Nugan Hand. We believe that the Australian people, the Parliament and certainly the Australian Labor Party will not be satisfied until there is a royal commission into all the activities of the persons involved as well as the organisation known as Nugan Hand.

         -The Australian Democrats welcome the extension of the terms of reference for the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking under Mr Justice Stewart. However, it seems that the extension of the terms of reference, whilst covering crime and drug dealing, does not do what the statement incorporated in Hansard by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) seems to imply. Page 3 of the statement reads:
        </para>

Therefore, the notion that we should investigate Nugan Hand only in relation to drug dealing, the laundering of money and other such areas is a severe limitation on the Commission's terms of reference and it is unacceptable to the majority of Australians.

         —Tonight I wish to voice concern about the electronic media's coverage of the Victorian State elections on the night the results came through. I do not do this in a partisan way because many of the Liberal scrutineers whom I talked to in the two weeks after the State election similarly voiced criticism of the absolutely pathetic coverage that that election result received on the night of the election. It is true to say that the commercial channels gave it very scant coverage. All three commercial stations gave the election half an hour's coverage at 10.30 on election night, four and a half hours after the polls closed. I do not think that is a coincidence. Either it occurred because the stations believe that that is when the ratings trail off and the second rate advertising should come on or there was a conspiracy between the three commercial stations and they said: 'None of us will break ranks. We will not give it any coverage. We will all go on with our normal commercial shows'. On the night of the election all they did from 7. 20 p.m. onwards was have two or three two-minute crossovers to the tally room when they informed the electorate of what the result would be. The regrettable thing was that in the first two crossovers all the stations predicted the wrong result. I daresay that if we had had a more extensive coverage by the commercial stations it would have given the stations more time to justify their wrong predictions. I should add that there was one exception, of which we in Victoria are proud, in that Bob Hawke predicted the result on the commercial channels two hours after the polls closed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, my real beef tonight is with the coverage given by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I am not an ABC basher. I have a high regard for that organisation. But I would have thought that it was its duty to give the election some sort of coverage. Apart from a couple of small crossovers, there was a section from 8 p.m. to 8.20 p.m. and a final one at 10.30 p.m., which was a half hour coverage, in which it failed to interview the new Premier or the outgoing Premier. To get its coverage the ABC stuck a camera over the back of about 50 reporters. It was a really pathetic coverage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The radio coverage did not on one occasion give a seat by seat call. People from other States would realise that the ABC radio coverage usually gives at least one call of the board to let people know the results. The television coverage by the ABC, when it was on air, was nothing short of pathetic. Garry Hutchinson, one of the journalists from the Melbourne Age, said that the coverage of certain electorates was universally trite, irrelevant and just prevented viewers from looking at the numbers. The ABC employed the services of a computer on the night. It was a marvellous computer! It did not work. People were running to members of the Australian Labor Party saying: 'What is the result in this seat?' The moment we gave it to them they fed it into the computer and that was the result which came up. However, I must congratulate the ABC's political expert, Mr Victor Prescott, for predicting a Labor victory at 9. 30 p.m. on election night. Three and a half hours after the polls closed this expert was able to discern a small swing to the Labor Party that would put it in government. The proverbial Blind Freddie could have seen at 8.30 p.m. what the election result would be. This is not the first time it has happened with the ABC's expert political coverage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remember in 1977, when the Liberal Party resoundingly defeated us in the Federal poll, at 10.10 p.m. the same individual detected a trend towards the Government being re-elected. I should have thought that the ABC would take care to engage someone who knew what he was talking about. I raise this matter tonight because on 15 May there will be a State election in Tasmania and there will be State elections in South Australia and Western Australia within the next 12 months. It is to be hoped that the people in those States will get a decent coverage of the State election results through the ABC. I do not believe that it would be such a poor rating program. No matter what the commercial channels do, I think the ABC has a duty to give those State elections a proper coverage.

         —I will not detain the Senate long because most honourable senators already know how I feel about the matter I wish to raise. I wish to express total abhorrence at the decision of Mr Justice Helsham, the Chief Judge in Equity in New South Wales, which has condemned to death a totally innocent little human being. This little person, if not wanted by his or her closest relatives, was wanted by others who were prepared to love and care for him or her. I wonder whether His Honour wore a black cap when he handed down the death sentence. He joins those paragons of 'Jeffreys' justice in recent years-Their Honours Judges Levine and Menhennitt; Their Honours indeed!- who are responsible for the disgracefully loose interpretations of abortion law. These men have opened the door to what now can only be described as mass killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent little Australians in the womb.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, State governments permit the killing and perhaps the one in New South Wales even encourages it. Federal Governments fund it, newspaper editorials support it and radical women's groups rejoice in it, but it is still wrong. They are fundamentally mistaken. The paradox in this country today is that the killing of whales and the destruction of the environment are criminal offences whilst our species-that is, human beings in the womb-are now destroyed almost at whim. The law, instead of protecting the helpless innocents, seems to me to use its full majesty to destroy them. Today, as part of that law process, we should be in mourning for a little unnamed innocent who would undoubtedly, if asked, have opted for life.

I wish to do so because I think there is a relationship to matters I have raised in respect of the Nugan Hand organisation. One cannot but be disturbed at the attempts being made by certain people in the bureaucracy, in the Bureau of Customs, to cover up the material that is contained in the documents relating to the importation of a colour television set by the Hon. M. J. R. MacKellar. I thought that I had read all the newspaper articles on this issue, which has been with us since Friday of last week. My impression, having read those articles, was that Mr Moore, the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, had been misinformed by his Department. I do not resile from that conclusion except that it could well be that he was not informed by his Department and, in fact, was deliberately misinformed of the events that began to unfold in October of last year.

The problem today is that a document was suddenly tabled and only a certain number of copies were distributed. I think the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) suggested that we should have the debate later today when documents were fully available, et cetera. I thought that was the correct procedure to adopt. Unfortunately what has happened now is that the program has expired. We did not get to the matter, which puts Senator Gietzelt in a very awkward position. I take it that he is the shadow Minister responsible for this area, that the matter falls within the area for which he has responsibility. So he has some difficulty.

In any case, the two hours notice may have been given on this occasion, but subsequently another very important document was tabled, relating to the Nugan Hand case.

All I am saying is that I think in the future we ought to get back to that procedure, even if it does inhibit the Government in its desire-I was going to say 'haste'- of bringing the problems before the Senate as soon as possible. I think it is far better to stay with the rules-that is, to give the two hours notice to the Opposition-and also to make certain that when a document is tabled in the Senate every honourable senator receives a copy. It may be that at that moment an honourable senator may want to raise a particular problem. He is entitled to do so and, what is more, he should be able to do so. That is why I have just entered the debate. There is no way in which we can satisfy Senator Gietzelt's requirement tonight because of the Standing Order, but I say that we did get a clear indication from the Leader of the Government that we would have the debate today. I come back to the other problem. I suggest that the Government should let the party leaders on the Opposition side have documents two hours before they are tabled so that the leaders can make the necessary arrangements for some extended debate at the time. As it was, we had two of-the-cuff performances, both good, by Senator Grimes on one matter and by Senator Gietzelt on the other. But that left the debate up in the air and no one else was able to participate.

I shall take Senator Gietzelt's matter first because I should like to clear up any misunderstanding in the light of what Senator Georges said. The two-hour rule applies to situations in which honourable senators wish to seek leave to make statements. If at any time a Minister wants to make a statement the rule is that two hours notice should be provided to those from whom leave is to be sought. The same requirement does not apply to documents that are to be tabled. The question of courtesy, of course, involves us in giving what notice we can, but the documents which were tabled today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) were documents of great public interest and of great importance and it was considered that the moment they became available they should be placed before the Parliament. I think that was a proper course to take with the documents as was the course that was taken to expedite a debate. In the event, the debate was not brought on today but Senator Sir John Carrick said that it will occur tomorrow.

        In relation to Senator Martyr's speech, I take it that no comment is required from the Government. The only point I would make-the honourable senator has not remained in the chamber-is that I thought the reference to Mr Justice Helsham went very close to contravening the Standing Orders. I think that was a little unfortunate.

       <para>
        In relation to Senator Robert Ray's speech, I am not aware of exactly what the coverage was of the Victorian State election. I have no reason to doubt it was as Senator Robert Ray said. I take it he was not watching all the channels or listening to the radio simultaneously . I take it he has heard this from people who were monitoring the electronic media.

         —Senator Robert Ray said he had prior knowledge. Part of the difficulty, of course, is that a State election, even one as important to Senator Robert Ray's party as that particular election was, is not of the same importance as a national election and it attracts a different degree of media interest and media coverage. In New South Wales, of course, we were sorry that a by-election last week did not receive greater media coverage. I guess that is the way of the world. I am not willing to agree with the honourable senator that those who participated were necessarily incompetent or anything else. I am sure that the commentators made their decisions as and when they could. I have always enjoyed watching Victor Prescott. As often as not he has been saying things about my party and how it is faring on a particular evening. The fact that he did not make a decision until 9.30 p.m. could be just natural caution.
        </para>

       <para>
        I recall in 1974 when I was first elected to this place there was a commentator then on one of the television channels, the same commentator who was applauded by Senator Robert Ray tonight, Mr Robert Hawke. He started the evening full of enthusiam for what the result was going to be and became less and less certain as that evening went on. As honourable senators may recall at the end of the evening he was not at all certain. I do think it is possible to be cautious with very good reason. The real point that Senator Robert Ray was putting to the Senate was that he hoped that in relation to the forthcoming State elections in Tasmania, the immediate one coming up in Tasmania and the ones to come in South Australia and Western Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Commission would give some consideration to adequate coverage of those events. I think that was the point he was really asking me to take to the Minister whom I represent. That I will undertake to do and put to him the points which have been raised by the honourable senator.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. Entry in the past was limited mainly to senior secondary level students from developing countries in our region where educational facilities were assessed as being inadequate. Overseas students may now be admitted for study from all countries at junior as well as senior secondary level, although entry at junior secondary level is in the main confined to students attending boarding schools because of the need to ensure the provision of adequate supervision.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As indicated above, entry was previously limited in the main to the senior secondary level. Entry was permitted at Year 11, but the majority of overseas students entered directly into Year 12.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Details of the numbers of applications received by non-government schools are not available, but the schools have indicated that numbers of inquiries and applications received by them have increased significantly in recent months.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) and (5) The Government recently decided, following a review by the Public Service Board, that the ADAB Regional Offices should continue to carry out their present functions, which include the provision of welfare counselling services to all overseas students whether sponsored or private from developing countries and assisting co-ordinating committees to provide a community-based welfare program. All private students must have a financial guarantor who is responsible for all costs connected with their travel and stay in Australia. Junior secondary students may only be admitted to boarding schools or to day schools when satisfactory private arrangements have been made for their accommodation and supervision.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Separate statistics on visa applications by level of study are not maintained. Visa issue statistics for the 1980/81 financial year show that 2165 visas were issued to secondary students (including some 700 exchange students). It is expected that around 3,500 secondary students will be admitted in 1982 ( including an estimated 1,000 exchange students).
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) No additional funds have been made available to the Commonwealth Schools Commission or to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, intended specifically for the support of overseas students. However, under Commonwealth funding arrangements for schools, overseas students are counted for enrolment purposes in determining the level of general recurrent grants paid to non- government schools. Commonwealth funds are also provided to government schools for general purposes and overseas students in those schools may also benefit from those general purpose funds.

       Throughout Australia, Australia Post staff are entitled to the holiday traditionally granted to Australian public sector employees between Christmas and New Year, usually observed on the day following the Boxing Day holiday.
      </para>
      <para>
       Prior to 1981, except where special arrangements were made, post offices closed on that holiday and mail deliveries were not provided. As a result, in some years, the public has been without postal services for up to five consecutive days (including weekends) over the Christmas period.
      </para>
      <para>
       In March 1981, Australia Post held discussions with retail trading organisations to ascertain the day on which they considered Australia Post should observe the Authorised Holiday to minimise customer inconvenience. Because the day following the New Year Holiday is generally a quieter trading day, the view was that Australia Post should observe the holiday on that day.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Postal Commission subsequently decided that, as from 1981, Australia Post should observe the holiday on a day which will limit the period without postal services to four consecutive days (including weekends). Generally , the holiday will be observed on the day following the New Year Holiday, as was the case for 1981.

       (1) A concession of one-third of the basic telephone rental is granted to categories of people such as pensioners, blind persons and war widows, whose eligibility is certified by either the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Eligibility is also dependent upon certain household income provisions published in a Determination under the Telecommunications Act of 1975. The cost of the concession is reimbursed to Telecom.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Applications for the concession may be lodged at any Telecom Business Office, at offices of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Social Security, or at any Post Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       Applications for the concession are directed in the first instance to the Department concerned for endorsement as to eligibility and return to Telecom, where the applicants' accounting records are up-dated or the applicant advised of non-eligibility whichever is appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No statistics are available but most concessions should be applied within approximately 4-6 weeks from application. Delays can occur due to non- availability of new telephone services, or inadequate information on the application.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The application procedure was recently revised with consequent reduction in delays. However, as an application may be handled by up to three agencies, some delay is unavoidable.

       (1) The Commonwealth charges at export registered abbattoirs for meat inspection are, per animal, as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       $ Cattle and buffaloes  1.80 Calves  0.60 Bobby Calves  0.18 Sheep, lambs and goats  0.18 Pigs  0.60

       (2) The charges are imposed on all livestock processed through registered export abattoirs. Exemptions are provided for livestock the carcases of which are condemned or rejected by inspectors as unfit for human consumption and for situations when Commonwealth inspectors are not on duty due to industrial action .
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The percentage of animals on which the inspection levy is paid which are ultimately exported cannot be calculated because, in many instances, parts of the carcase are sold on the domestic market and other parts on the export market . On a weight basis, an estimated 64 per cent of meat from livestock slaughtered in export works was exported in 1980-81.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Australia's major meat market requires that a single inspection standard apply at all times to meat produced in export registered abattoirs, regardless of the market on which the meat will be ultimately sold. The Commonwealth and the States agree that this single standard for meat inspection will prevail in export registered abattoirs. The charges recover for the Commonwealth a part only of its costs in ensuring that meat produced in export registered abattoirs is to export standard of health and hygiene.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The rebate for an excess of concessional expenditure over the sum of $1,590 stems from changes made to the personal income tax system by the previous Government in 1975-76, when a general tax rebate was introduced. At that time, all taxpayers were allowed a general tax rebate and a further rebate was allowed to those taxpayers whose concessional expenditure in total exceeded a given amount, initially $1,350. This scheme replaced the deduction that has previously been allowed for concessional expenditures.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the financial year 1977-78, the present Government did away with the general rebate and introduced instead a very substantial zero-rated first step of the income tax scale. The commencing point for the additional rebate for ''excess'' concessional expenditure was set $100 below the level to which it had by then risen as a result of indexation of the general rebate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Since 1977-78, the standard rate personal income tax scale has been indexed by approximately 11.8 per cent. If the $1,590 had been indexed in line with the tax scale, it would now be $1,778.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Indexation of the figure would have meant that fewer taxpayers could have obtained a concessional expenditure rebate, as expendiure levels between $1,590 and $1,778 would not have attracted a rebate, as they now do.

      <para>
       (1) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the statement which was made in a paper presented at the Australian Academy of Science's symposium on the biology of rare and endangered species in Australia. This statement applied to research on animals rather than plants. Dr McMichael, who is an acknowledged expert on endangered species conservation, estimated that the research necessary to understand the biology of any one endangered species, to the extent necessary for the indentification of likely causes of decline in numbers and/or range, could not be undertaken for less than $100,000. He concluded that, in view of the number of endangered species, it was unlikely that sufficient funds would ever be available to adequately research all such species and that it would therefore be necessary to choose between them.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Department of Home Affairs and Environment is not a research organisation and has no budget for research on the causes and antidotes to the extinction of endangered species. Most research of this kind in Australia is undertaken by staff of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Wildlife Research; Commonwealth, State and Territory wildlife authorities; Museums and Herbaria; and University Zoology and Botany Departments. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service funds annual programs of research and surveys related to nature conservation including studies on endangered species. The budget approved for these programs in 1981-82 amounted to $255,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) A list of 94 endangered species of Australian mammals, birds and reptiles has been adopted by the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers. This list is currently being examined by a Working Group established by the Council to determine priorities for research and management programs. There is also another Working Group of the Council concerned with the listing of endangered species of plants.

       The United Nations Service Medal, Korea, is neither a British or a foreign award and is not provided for in traditional rules. It was established under the authority of the United Nations and accepted by member nations which participated in the Korean War.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Korean War was the first action involving Australian troops in a United Nations Force. The United Nations Service Medal, Korea was the first such award made by the international body and conventions applying to foreign awards i.e. awards of other national entities are not seen as relevant in that context.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Australian Government sought and was given the permission by the Queen to accept the Vietnam Campaign Medal as a special case. The American, Korean and Thai Governments had accepted the Vietnamese offer and a refusal could have affected the morale of Australian troops then serving in operations in Vietnam.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In 1979, the Australian Government received advice that by Presidential decree issued in Greece in 1978 eligibility to a Commemmorative Medallion which had been established in 1946 for members of Greek units which fought in Greece during World War II had been extended to foreign servicemen who served in Greece as members of the Allied Forces.

      <para>
       (4) British and Australian servicemen who served in Greece and Crete in 1941 were awarded the British 1939-45 Star in recognition of that service. It is a long standing convention in British and Australian honours and awards practice that no person should receive more than one award in recognition of the one act or service. None of the circumstances which applied to the Korea Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, Korea, or the Vietnamese Campaign Medal apply in the case of the Greek Commemorative Medallion and the considerations governing acceptance of these various medals cannot validly be compared.

       (1) and (2) Dependants' pensions for wives and children of totally incapacitated veterans have not been increased because successive Governments have concentrated available finance on ensuring that incapacitated veterans and war/defence widows are adequately compensated in terms of pension and have the best possible medical treatment facilities available to them. In this way, the whole family receives the benefit of increased pensions and allowances and the primary purpose of Repatriation pensions, as compensation for service-related disabilities, is achieved. Any proposal to increase the dependants' pension payable to the wife or child of a disabled veteran would need to be considered in the Budget context.

       (4) Some fortnightly dependants' pensions could be as low as 28 cents for children, where the veteran receives a 10% disability pension. The cost of processing such payments in isolation would be approximately the same as the payments themselves, but usually such payments are included with either the veteran's or his wife's pension.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) In introducing six monthly indexation in 1976, the Government took the decision to index only main Repatriation pensions. Adjustments to other pensions and allowances are considered in the Budget context, taking account of priorities and available resources.

       (1) Was the aircraft in which four German tourists were killed in Victoria during the latter part of 1981 found by chance after a very extensive search which included Royal Australian Air Force F111 aircraft as well as many other aircraft; and was the crash site actually on the plotted course, with the aircraft apparently crashing at the highest point of its flight path.

       (1) Yes. The aircraft was located by a departmental aircraft engaged in photography of the search area for inclusion in the report of the investigation into the accident.

      <para>
       The wreckage was located on the flight planned track of the aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Primary attention by way of complete saturation searching by rotary and fixed wing search aircraft, was given to a relatively small area which embraced the wreckage site. However, the density of the primary and secondary vegetation, in conjunction with the topography of the primary search area, is such that it is possible to hover directly over a search target without a sighting unless wreckage disturbed by fire or broken foliage. These conditions defy the effective use of aerial photography and other available electronic detection devices. No assistance was received from the emergency location beacon carried on this aircraft, which was found subsequently to have been completely destroyed on impact.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been no requirement to amend search techniques as a result of this search. Search methods and techniques employed by my Department are continuously reviewed and upgraded in the light of national and international experience.

       There has been a considerable increase in awareness of equal employment philosophies at all levels in the organisation. Statements and staff bulletins have been issued on each of the separate equal employment programmes. The incidence of improved employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups in the Department has increased. Recruitment and selection procedures have been modified to incorporate many of the points in the National Labour Consultative Council Guidelines as have departmental training courses in supervision and interviewing techniques.

        —On 25 August 1981 (Hansard, page 254) Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning foreign ownership of Australian merchant banks. As part of my answer to the honourable senator's question, I undertook to seek, from the Treasurer, advice as to any action he might take to increase Australian equity in this industry.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Treasury has advised me that the following foreign investment policy requirements are designed to maintain and, over time, to increase Australian equity in the financial sector:
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposals for the establishment of new merchant banks are approved, other than in very exceptional circumstances, only if there will be at least 50 per cent beneficial Australian equity and effective participation by way of at least shared Australian-foreign control of the new venture.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposals by foreign investors to acquire an interest in an existing merchant bank are closely examined, whether the shares are currently owned by Australian interests or are held by overseas interests, the procedures followed in each case being:
      </para>
      <para>
       if the shares are currently owned by Australian interests, and the proposed sale to foreign investors thus involved a reduction in the level of Australian ownership, approval would be granted only in circumstances where it had been demonstrated that substantial benefits could be expected to accrue to Australia , taking account of the implications of the proposal for the financial sector. In practice, because merchant banks operating in Australia already provide a wide range of services, this is generally a difficult test to meet.
      </para>
      <para>
       if the shares are currently owned by overseas interests then the proposed purchase by other foreign investors would not involve a reduction in the level of Australian ownership, and the proposal would normally be approved provided the Government was satisfied that the shares had first been offered to Australian investors and that no Australian investors were interested in acquiring them on commercial terms and conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Merchant banks that were established with high levels of foreign ownership in the period prior to the introduction of the present foreign investment guidelines are encouraged, by way of the procedures mentioned above, to introduce or increase Australian equity participation. In addition, in the context of the Government's approval of certain proposals Australian equity has been required to be introduced within specified time periods. Apart from these procedures and the existence of Australian equity conditions remaining to be fulfilled in certain specific cases, however, there is no general requirement for merchant banks established prior to the introduction of the present foreign investment guidelines to introduce Australian equity.

      <para>
       1. No. This single group of 34 Laotians was settled in the Northern Territory as part of the Government's refugee program, on the basis of a family reunion sponsorship by relatives.

       It was never envisaged by the Department that refugee groups would be brought to the Northern Territory as part of a pilot scheme to test the viability of subsistence farming.

       The proposed entry of such a large family group to a single sponsor gave rise to initial concern, and approval was only given following firm assurances of support from the sponsor and representations on his behalf from prominent members of the Northern Territory community.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. On 23 January 1981 a complaint was made by one member of the group to the Grant-in-Aid worker at the Resource and Settlement Centre in Darwin. The substance of this complaint was subsequently brought to the attention of the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security, The Northern Territory Department of Community Development, and The Northern Territory Housing Commission.
      </para>

       Departmental officers have consulted with other Government Departments and agencies about the welfare of this group, for example adult members attended English classes for a total of 460 hours in 1980 and 288 hours in 1981; the group had welfare support from the Darwin Grant-in-Aid worker, whose salary is funded by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

        —On 10 March 1982 (Hansard, page 642) Senator Macklin asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Education, a question without notice about copyright costs in schools.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's intention to amend the Copyright Act 1968 was announced by the Attorney-General in June 1978. The following month, the Commonwealth and State Ministers for Education, meeting as the Australian Education Council, established a working party to advise them on the implications for schools.
      </para>
      <para>
       In June 1979 the Attorney-General tabled a Copyright Amendment Bill, for public discussion. In September that year, the then Minister for Education strongly supported the AEC working party's submission that the arrangements proposed for recording school copying were too complex and costly, and asked the Attorney-General to delay the leglislation until a simpler system of record -keeping could be devised.
      </para>
      <para>
       My understanding is that the Copyright Amendment Act eventually passed in September 1980 should be much easier for schools to work under, than the legislation originally proposed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nevertheless some administrative costs can be expected, in addition to royalty costs which may be incurred where schools reproduce copyright material for their classes under the new legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has been suggested to me that the Commonwealth should provide funds to offset these costs, and I have consulted the Attorney-General in this matter as the Minister responsible for copyright law.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth will not be providing extra funds specifically to assist schools or other institutions to meet copyright costs. The Commonwealth cannot accept the proposition that where a change in the copyright law is made and expense is incurred by a party in order to take advantage of new rights conferred, the Commonwealth should contribute specifically towards meeting that expenditure.
      </para>
      <para>
       School funding is basically a matter for the State Governments and other bodies which operate schools. The Commonwealth, through its Schools Commission, provides these bodies with substantial additional funds, most of which are not designated for particular purposes. Where the Commonwealth's contribution to school funding is concerned, it is not the Government's policy that special funds should automatically be provided for every new cost incurred as a result of legislative or other changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       If in due course the States choose to document cost increases arising from the changes to copyright law in their routine submissions to the Commonwealth Schools Commission, the Government will be in a position to decide whether or not those costs should influence the overall level of funds to be provided for schools by the Commonwealth.

       The Government is aware of reports that President Reagan has authorised covert operations against the Government of Nicaragua. The United States Government is aware of the Australian Government's concern about the situation in Central America. I discussed this with Vice President Bush when I visited Washington last year. In August last year the French and Mexican Governments in a joint statement on El Salvador recalled that it was for the Salvadoran people to indicate a settlement process and appealed to the international community to work, particularly in the framework of the United Nations, in order that there might be reconciliation in El Salvador. In February this year the President of Mexico called for a process of negotiations to bring peace to El Salvador and to improve United States relations with Nicaragua and Cuba. He offered his services as a mediator. The Australian Government would be prepared to support any move for a political settlement which had the agreement of all the main parties to the conflict in El Salvador. The Government has welcomed the elections to be held in El Salvador on 25 March and expressed the hope that they will contribute to peace and reconciliation in El Salvador. The Government has noted and welcomes the fact that the United States has underlined the importance of economic and social reform in El Salvador and other countries of Central America. The recent announcement by President Reagan of a Caribbean Basin Economic Program with increased United States aid, trade and investment of US$350 million in direct economic assistance, is evidence of this. The Australian Government also accepts that the United States has taken a stand in the face of evidence of external support for left-wing guerilla movements operating inside El Salvador.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Is it true the Government is facing significant losses in revenue because of inadequate validation checks on excise collection? Does this arise from a report of an efficiency audit of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs? Did the Auditor-General estimate that the loss of revenue stemmed from doubtful accuracy of meters used to calculate revenue? Did this comment relate to losses claimed as occurring in oil refineries during transfers from refineries to depots or within depots? Finally, did the Auditor-General estimate that the loss of revenue which resulted is probably $10m a year?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Report of the Auditor-General on an Efficiency Audit of 'The Collection of Excise duties and deferred Customs duties by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs', the Auditor-General did report specifically on petroleum products.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the report the Auditor-General acknowledged that legitimate losses of petroleum products did occur because of their volatile nature. He explained that under present controls the Department relies upon checks of company records supported by physical investigations in determining dutiable quantities for the payment of revenue and that in relation to losses the Department accepts figures based upon previous performance patterns, unless they are abnormal, rather than technical analysis.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the present arrangements dutiable quantities are determined at the time of product entering home consumption from refineries or depots.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Auditor-General in his report advocates the installation of independent meters for the measurement of dutiable quantities at the point of production within refineries as a means of validation of company records of total production and allowing greater departmental effort in assessing companies' claims for losses.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Auditor-General did not refer to an estimated loss of $10m revenue a year. In this regard he said, 'The notional duty attaching to losses claimed as occurring in refineries, during transfers from refineries to depots, or within depots is of the order of $10m annually. Measurement of dutiable volume at the point of production and placing more onus on the companies to justify claims for losses would in view of this office, be more conducive to ensuring the collection in full of revenues due'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has commenced discussions with oil companies with a view to examining the cost-benefit and long-term technical implications of installing accurate flow measurement devices at the point of production in refineries.
