         —My question is addressed to Senator Peter Baume in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or alternatively as Minister representing the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that a recent evaluation by the Commonwealth Government of its spending on Aboriginal health supported the view that funding to the States has not achieved the Government's purpose because the States as a whole have not accepted the Commonwealth policy of involving Aboriginals in the design, control and delivery of health services for Aboriginals and the States have used the savings for services that the States should pay for themselves as part of their own responsibility for the health of all residents? Will the Government make the evaluation available to the Senate? Do the statistics also show that such health funds are unevenly distributed among the States, with Western Australia, with 16 per cent of the Aboriginal population, receiving about 50 per cent of these funds but still failing to attract Aboriginal support for its programs? In these circumstances, what action will the Commonwealth take to secure a more effective program and, in particular, more control by Aboriginals in the design and delivery of such services?

         —Before I became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs several reviews of Aboriginal health had occurred, some of them public, in which there had been criticism of the activities of some of the States in providing for Aboriginal health using funds from the Commonwealth under State grants provisions. There has been considerable movement and change since that time. The State grants for Aboriginal health provide a base for a large amount of Aboriginal employment. There are a large number of Aboriginal health workers whose funding is dependent upon some State grants continuing. It is correct to say, though, that there was criticism. As a result of that criticism the Commonwealth, in the last two years, has opened up negotiations with the various States and the Northern Territory with a view to changing the arrangements and to involving Aboriginals to a greater extent in the design, planning, implementation and evaluation of health services for themselves.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At the same time, the Commonwealth has funded a large number of Aboriginal medical services controlled by Aboriginal people. During my time as Minister we extended the number of independent Aboriginal medical services which were funded and which operate now as independent Aboriginal-controlled organisations. But it would be wrong to suggest that the States have been non-responsive. Senator Missen represents Victoria. He would be interested to know that the previous Victorian State Government and the Commonwealth were able to negotiate at the end of last year a new arrangement for the use of State grants moneys and for the provision of health services in Victoria. As a result of those arrangements an entirely new system of health services was implemented in Victoria, which was Aboriginal controlled. Victoria agreed to give up much of the money which it had been receiving. The Commonwealth reallocated that money to Aboriginal medical services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point I want to make is that the criticisms which were made in the last two or three years were significant but they have been followed up by action by the Commonwealth and by States to improve the situation. Some of the States other than Victoria, for example, have created new advisory committees and new positions for Aboriginals to help to direct what occurs in that State in terms of the way its medical services are delivered. I will have to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether the situation is yet satisfactory. I do know that there has been progress. I will refer Senator Missen's question to the Minister whom I represent in case there is something that can be added.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final point I make concerns Senator Missen's question about the percentage of Aboriginal population and the percentage of money applied State by State. When the program was introduced some States got going more quickly than other States. Those States that were up and running first seem to have the largest programs in operation. I think that over the last few years there has been an attempt to alter the percentages slightly to bring them back towards the population ratio. We will have to look at the result of the recent census to see the extent to which they are out of plumb. There is an historical reason which explains why some of the States get what appears to be an inordinately large amount of the money.

I think all Australians will agree with him that, if we are to look for priorities, water, which is our scarcest resource, ought to be given increasing priority. That is precisely what is happening under the Government's policies. For example, in the Budget appropriation that has been before the Senate, about $41.7m has been allocated to the National Water Resources Program, which is an increase of 28 per cent over the allocation for last year. It will be spread over the various States. In addition, there is the funding of the Burdekin Dam in Queensland, which is a major project.

        Senator Jessop referred to the River Murray. He will know that the River Murray Waters Agreement has now been signed, that legislation has been introduced into another place to confirm that agreement and that the great qualitative undertakings for the control of the River Murray are now in process. The former State Government in South Australia came forward with a proposal which, taken in total over a number of years, would cost about $400m. The Government took the view that priorities could be achieved but not in the quantitative sense. Many had been represented by the Maunsell committee and the Government is proceeding to deal with them. Many are already in process. A working party has produced a report regarding the control of salinity, particularly in regard to irrigation processes along the River Murray. That report is being studied. The upgrading of attention to the River Murray is very real and very significant. I think that is acknowledged by the three States concerned. The work that we are now putting in hand on that alone will enhance the quality and quantity of flow of the water. But apart from that, the formation of a National Water Resources Council and the perspective overview study of water up to the year 2000 indicate the priorities that this Government is giving to water.

I reminded Senator Chipp that the only public opinion polls on it were those that had been taken by various reputable authorities and that they had shown a majority support for uranium mining as well as a majority support by supporters of the Australian Democrats for uranium mining. That was my precise answer. It is true that Senator Chipp's question was fundamentally wrong on the basis that, however belatedly, the Labor Party in South Australia changed its policies and said that it supported Roxby Downs. In fact there was, on the surface, bipartisan support for Roxby Downs.

         —I recall the controversy referred to by the honourable senator. It related to the fact that arrangements had been made between the previous Victorian Government and my Department in Victoria to include with pensioners' cheques an insertion which advised on the availability of a booklet which detailed the concessions for pensioners which were available in that State. That was a matter which became controversial because, coincidentally, the inserts became closely related in time to the holding of the Victorian election. About half were sent prior to the election and about half after the election. As I indicated at that time, that was certainly fortuitous and the whole matter had been arranged departmentally and without reference to me.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Recently, the Department again without reference to me-I have no complaint about that-approved the inclusion with the cheques which are sent to unemployment beneficiaries in Victoria of an insert which advises them of some new concessions which have been offered by the present Victorian Government with respect to transport. The Victorian Government has made available a transport concession which will facilitate travel for the unemployed while they are on unemployment benefit. The notice advises them of the availability of a concession card which is valid for daily tickets. It is not available for travel in the metropolitan area before 9 a.m. Monday to Friday and so on. It is, consistent with the approach which is generally taken, a facility which is made available when it is thought to be in the interests of pensioners or beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated, guidelines have been laid down to govern the use of cheque inserts. Those guidelines cover the sorts of things that I think honourable senators would expect. For a start, there is a requirement that the insert should not give rise to any likelihood that there will be a delay in the dispatch of cheques. Of course, it is a primary responsibility of my Department to get payments out on time. We will provide inserts only for government departments or statutory authorities. We have to be able to make the judgment that the publicity is inoffensive to all groups within the client population, that it would not serve, even indirectly, commercial ends, that the inclusion could not be construed as an invasion of privacy and so on. In fact, a detailed set of rules applies in these cases.
       </para>
       <para>
        Within the last week or two a cheque insert has been included with pensioners' cheques advising them of recent changes to the social security legislation. This is one valuable means which is available to the Government of informing the client population of my Department of information which is of assistance to them . I am pleased that Senator Hamer asked his question, because it was of concern to me that officers of my Department in Victoria were being subjected to the allegation that there had been some political bias on their part when I am quite satisfied that that was not the case. The rules are established. They are administered directly by officers of my Department, often without reference to me because the matter would not be one which required a policy decision if it were within the guidelines. I regard cheque inserts as a valuable means of getting information to our client population.

In view of the result of the referendum in South Australia relating to daylight saving, in which about three times as many people said that they wanted daylight saving as said that they did not want it, will the Minister ask the Minister for the Capital Territory to take the lead in the mainland areas and extend the period of daylight saving to six months in future summers and, at the end of the current period of daylight saving, extend the period for at least one month-something which I believe would have the overwhelming support of the people who have daylight saving?

Nevertheless, I will draw it to his attention and see whether he will confer with his relevant colleagues in the various States. As to the general thrust of the question and particularly the increase in the period that Senator Townley draws to our attention, it is, I think, a matter which would have different application in different States, as indeed we find in South Australia that daylight saving has different application in different parts of the State because of its breadth.

         —As far as I am aware-I will check it-no direct assistance is going to the ARPF from my Department. It is an initiative undertaken by the Rotary organisation in New South Wales and is aimed at providing a non- departmental source of advice to pensioners on matters relating to income and investment. I have indicated publicly that I think this is an excellent idea. I am aware that a senior officer of my Department, indeed, the Director of my Department in New South Wales, is a Rotarian and in a personal capacity is associated with the Foundation. I see that as a very appropriate form of private service for him to undertake. I certainly do not see that as being in conflict in any sense with his public duty as a public servant.

       <para>
        I will certainly be watching the ARPF with great interest because I am concerned about the difficulty of ensuring that pensioners have accurate information and objective advice on how they should look after their financial affairs. Probably members of the Senate will have seen over the weekend calls for the Department to do more to ensure that pensioners are better informed in this area. I have certainly heard that call from the Opposition spokesman on these matters, Senator Grimes, and I can advise the Senate that the Government does propose to enter into further advertising which will be relevant in this area. Within the last few days I have had discussions with an officer of my Department about the material which is currently available. For example we have recently produced, in conjunction with the Australian Taxation Office, a pamphlet explaining to pensioners the taxation situation in a way which I hope will be helpful. But I have asked my Department to examine the possibility of preparing a more substantial publication in this area which might be made generally available.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words-I stray a little from the question asked-the initiative of Rotary is independent of my Department although a senior departmental officer is involved as a Rotarian. I certainly welcome the fact that it is occurring. I will watch it as one of the approaches which might provide great assistance to pensioners. I do not see it as a substitute for action by my Department to inform pensioners on these matters.

The matter raised by Senator Archer is one which naturally is of concern to the dairy industry here and no doubt around the world. I have some information from the Department of Primary Industry on this matter. I am advised that the United States Government has taken a number of measures to deal with the problem of its surplus dairy production. The support price for milk has been frozen at the existing level of $US13.10 per cwt until October 1984. The Secretary of Agriculture has been authorised to impose on milk producers an assessment of 50c per cwt of milk produced from 1 December 1982 and a further assessment of 50c per cwt from 1 April 1983 if purchases of dairy products by the commodity credit corporations are estimated to exceed certain annual levels. There have also been extensive give-away programs to reduce the holdings and some special arrangements such as the sale to New Zealand of 110,000 tonnes of butter. In fact these measures have not altered the build-up of surplus dairy stocks in the United States and the United States Government is considering the disposal of surplus dairy products on the world market.

Is the Minister aware that major components manufacturers in the truck components industry are among the many industries which have had to introduce a four-day week after previous retrenchments, with the next step being closure? In view of the rapid deterioration in manufacturing industry which has occurred, particularly in the past few weeks, will the Government consider introducing temporary import quotas on a broad range of goods as soon as the IAC report is received?

         —The present situation of manufacturing industry is, of course, a matter of great concern to the Government. The reduction in employment which has recently occurred is similarly a matter of great concern. A key problem which, of course, is affecting Australian industry, as it is international industry, is the very significant reduction in world trade which has occurred over the last year or so. If all countries adopted the course suggested by the honourable senator in his question the problem would be exacerbated and no doubt many Australian export industries would find themselves severely disadvantaged. One has to be very careful, in taking action of any sort, to ensure that it does not have side effects which simply increase the problem. I do not believe that the honourable senator's suggestion that a general reference be made to the Industries Assistance Commission would receive widespread support, even in industry itself. However, I will refer the suggestion to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for his consideration. The second part of the question really flows from that suggestion because it envisages an IAC report being made and some consequent government action taking place. But, as I say, I suspect that the proposal would not be widely welcomed among manufacturers in Australia. In any event I will ask Mr Peacock to give it consideration and provide a more considered reply to the Senate.

We believe that the debate which is arising in the state aid area is yesterday's debate and has no place today. The editorial, supportive as it was, contained a few inaccuracies. It might be worth setting those to rest. First of all, Catholic schools in Australia are better off in real terms today than they ever have been. They are not worse off, as the editorial might have been seen to be implying. I have taken out some figures. I do not know what honourable senators regard as significant, but if they look at student-teacher ratios they will see that in Catholic primary schools they have improved since 1971 from 31 pupils per teacher to 23 pupils per teacher. In secondary schools the figure has gone down from 22 pupils per teacher to 16 pupils per teacher during the same period.

         —I thank the Senate. Increased resources have been applied and there are diminishing pupil-teacher ratios. During that period the Catholic schools have had to put in place an enormous change from religious to lay teachers, and this they have been able to do. They have now got to where government schools were, but government schools have been going ahead. The editorial made a couple of other points which I think require some comment. The editorial talked about income testing and said that income testing of non- government schools was desirable. The facts are that income testing of selected schools was introduced in 1982. For 1983 it is proposed that all non-government schools which are on the higher subsidy rates will be income tested. So the suggestion that has been made is one that this Government is implementing in order to ensure that schools receiving higher subsidies do put a proper percentage of their fee money into recurrent programs. That does not stop any schools that decide they want to charge low fees for social purposes, for widening access, from doing so but it does ensure that income testing will take place. To that extent we are already doing what the Sydney Morning Herald said was desirable.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The final point made in the editorial was that there should be accountability by non-government schools for moneys which they receive. I have no doubt that there should be public acountability by anyone who receives public moneys for any purpose. I have no difficulty with the concept that that accountability should extend to the school system. At the moment the Commonwealth Schools Commission is examining for me the questions relating to accountability, including the possibility of making information publicly available in relation to some of these financial matters. I do not think it is useful in the debate to confine questions of accountability to non-government schools. If we are going to talk about accountability it is something which should apply right across the school system. It may be time to ask that the government school systems expose themselves to the same kind of public accountability for the use of money. I come back to where I began. What was good about the editorial was that it supported Commonwealth support for non-government schools, which is a central part of our program. As honourable senators know, the Commonwealth Government has a basic grant for all non-government schools. We do not have in prospect the divisive and destructive program being proposed by the Australian Labor Party which will seek to take away from a number of students and parents the support which they presently enjoy.

         —There seems to be an extraordinary inability on the part of at least some people in the community to do what seems to me to be simple arithmetic. Clearly, a further reduction in working hours in this critically important industry must mean that the unit cost of labour will rise and that further difficulties will be created for those who would seek to build homes, or any other buildings. In this period of Australia's economy it is without doubt that raising labour costs significantly would be counter-productive. It is likely that it would reduce activity in a field in which we are doing everything we can to increase activity because activity is much lower than we would wish. Quite clearly the request currently being made is not in the public interest or indeed in the private interest. I doubt whether it is even in the interests of the union which is making it, because it is likely to lead to less employment rather than more employment in the building industry for members of that union. It seems to me to be shortsighted in the extreme and one can only hope that the union will see that and not persist with a claim which, as I said, is against both its interests and the interests of the community.

        For many years the State Health Services in Western Australia have provided substantial employment for Aborigines. In 1972 the Community Health Services were established as a branch of the Public Health Department, for the specific purpose of improving Aboriginal health. Particular emphasis was given to the employment of Aborigines in the Service. All positions in the Service are open to Aboriginal people on the proviso that they have the ability and required qualifications to do the job. Furthermore, certain positions are held almost exclusively for Aborigines and include such jobs as Enrolled Nurse and Health Worker. Aborigines have also been encouraged to fill other positions such as storemen, cleaners, drivers, typists and nurses where qualifications permit.

        The Aboriginal population has had a significant influence on the objectives and aims of the Service since its inception in 1972. Much of this influence has been of an informal nature and although practical and effective, these informal mechanisms have attracted some criticism. It is my intention to have these mechanisms formalised and to increase and consolidate the structure of the Service so that Aborigines may exert greater influence on Aboriginal heath policy decisions. In practical terms this can be separated into two parts:

       <para>
        Eighty-nine Aboriginal Health Workers are presently employed throughout the State. In the main they are nominated by Aboriginal communities. Over the past 18 months job descriptions and duties have been drawn up in consultation with the relative community so that both Service and community expectations are met. It is proposed to increase the numbers of Health Workers during the coming financial year.

       </para>
       <para>
        A camp nurse is an Aborigine living in a community and selected by that community to undertake some specific health tasks. They are not substantive employees of the Public Health Department. Each Camp Nurse is however paid an honorarium for their services. There are 75 such Camp Nurses in various communities throughout the State, who assist and advise their people as the need arises. The Camp Nurse receives some education and instructions from Service staff. Camp nurses are usually family women with some medical standing in the community.

I am not aware of the exact position in relation to the availability of the forms. I will have that matter referred to the appropriate Minister. I will see that an early response is given to the Senate or that public information is given on it. As was referred to by Senator Chaney a little earlier, it is the Government's intention to provide information on the changes within the Budget that are of benefit to the people of Australia. I think those matters are in hand with the respective Ministers. However, I will see what information I can get as soon as possible so that the Senate may be advised on the matter raised by Senator MacGibbon.

Is the Minister aware that the reason given by the company for these latest retrenchments is the flood of competitive imports on to the Australian market? Is the Minister also aware of a statement by the General Manager of Kelvinator, Mr Carlson, that the temporary subsidy assistance granted to the company will not restrain competitive imports of room air conditioners? I ask the Minister: Why does the Government disagree with the claims made by the company that the temporary tariff and quota assistance would have been a more effective way of combating the flood of cheap imports into Australia? When can we expect some positive and more direct action by the Federal Government to stop, once and for all, the destruction of our manufacturing industries by the inflow of cheap imports?

         —The honourable senator will be aware that the Government announced some little time ago that it was to provide assistance to Kelvinator, which matter he had raised by way of question in the Senate, as had other senators, following the report of the Temporary Assistance Authority. The Government's action was taken consistent with the recommendation of the Temporary Assistance Authority, which took the view that the procedure recommended by the company would not be effective as a means of providing additional protection because a large number of imports were already in the country. In other words, the imported summer stocks with which Kelvinator will be competing for this summer's trade are already imported. So for that reason the Temporary Assistance Authority recommended to the Government that the assistance should be by way of bounty.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the event, the Government accepted the Authority's recommendation and granted assistance of $1.5m to Kelvinator by way of bounty. That is a quite generous level of assistance. Kelvinator has said that it is not as much as it would like, but it permits Kelvinator to cut the price of its product and to compete more adequately upon the market. In this matter the Government has been guided by the expert advice that it has received from the Temporary Assistance Authority. On the basis of that advice-which certainly seemed, on the face of it , correct-the Government believed that when the imports were already in the country there was little point in imposing some quantitative restriction which would have had no effect at all.

In view of the very urgent need for Australia to be well placed to take the earliest advantage of world recovery through competitive exports and so create much needed employment opportunities, is the Government's appeal for moderation in wage increases and resistance to shorter working hours receiving a satisfactory response from the Australian Council of Trade Unions?

However, I think it would be better if I referred that question to Mr Macphee for reply. Clearly, it is highly desirable that there should be broad support within Australia on the part of employers and the trade union movement for the general propositions that Senator Walters has set out in her question. We wish to see a restraint on wage increases-not because we desire anyone to have less money but because we see such increases as being against the interests of maintaining employment in Australia and certainly against our interests in being able to take advantage of any increase in world trade when it occurs. So the matter raised by Senator Walters is serious. I shall refer it to Mr Macphee for him to respond on the basic point of the question, which is the attitude of the ACTU to calls for wage restraint.

       <para>
        On 9 September I tabled in Parliament the report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission containing its recommendations for the calendar year 1983, in response to the Government's guidelines. The Bill gives effect to the Government 's decisions on the Commission's financial recommendations for the distribution of funds for 1983, all of which have been accepted. As announced in the Government's guidelines statement, the Bill also provides for additional funds for 1982 programs, to help meet unanticipated cost increases arising from recent teacher salary determinations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill now before the Senate reflects amendments made in another place which will establish the legal position regarding the interest of the Commonwealth and non-government school authorities where Commonwealth grants have been used for the purchase of major assets by non-government schools and the requirements regarding recovery of grants in the event of disposal of such assets. The amendments will also provide for funding on a per capita basis in 1982 of intensive English language programs for non-English speaking students who are newly arrived in Australia, bringing the total Commonwealth financial commitment to an estimated $11.1m this year. The Bill had already provided for the funding of this program on a per capita basis for 1983. The final costs of the 1982 and 1983 programs will therefore be determined by the actual number of eligible newly-arrived students.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overall level of Commonwealth expenditure on schools programs in 1983 will be about $1241m, an increase of 3.7 per cent in real terms over 1982, all amounts being in 1983 outturn prices. The value of most programs will be at least maintained in real terms. For some programs there will be significant real increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part II of the Bill contains provision for programs in government schools. To assist the States to overcome the financial difficulties which the Commission reported were facing government school systems, general recurrent grants for government schools will be increased by 2 per cent in real terms in 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        Funds for the capital grants program for government schools will be maintained at the same real level as in 1982. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that 10 per cent of the funds be distributed on the basis of certain indicators of the need to provide new pupil places. In addition, a general clause has been included in the Bill indicating that prior to the granting of funds to a State, the Commonwealth Minister must be satisfied with arrangements to identify projects to which Commonwealth funds are to be applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part III of the Bill contains provision for programs in non-government schools. General recurrent grants to non-government schools have been increased in accordance with the policy which ties Commonwealth per capita grants to non- government schools to movements in the average cost of educating a student in a government school. The increases in commitments to non-government schools are also a result of increases in the subsidy rate to schools with the lowest recurrent resources, Group 3, from 38 per cent to 40 per cent of average government school standard costs. This fulfills the Government's commitment in the 1980 election to provide three levels of assistance for non-government school equal to 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the average cost of educating a student in a government school. Almost 95 per cent of the increase in Commonwealth general recurrent grants in 1983 will be directed to those schools assessed as having lowest recurrent resources. On average such schools operate at recurrent resource levels some 30 per cent below those of government schools.

        The Government endorses the Commission's intention to implement fully the previous decision to give consideration to income as well as expenditure in the assessment of non-government schools' subsidy categories and expects that the income checking procedure introduced on a limited basis in 1982 will be applied to all non-government schools eligible for Group 2 or Group 3 grants in 1983.

       <para>
        The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that eligibility for grants under the short-term emergency assistance program be extended to include any non-government school suffering a financial crisis caused by a sudden disaster.

        For the general support element of the English as a second language program a further adjustment has been made to the distribution of program funds among the States to accord with the results of a recent national survey of students of non -English speaking background. Funds for the general support element for non- government schools have not been allocated on a State-by-State basis in the Bill . However, the Government intends that the allocations to Catholic schools in the various States and Territories will be in accordance with the recommended distribution in the Commission's Report. For non-Chatholic schools, the Government intends that State planning and finance committees should continue to be responsible for recommending the distribution of funds.

        A significant new policy development encompassed in this Bill is the provision for the participation of children of below school age in the special education program. This also applies to the children in institutions and severely handicapped children's programs which are joint programs for both government and non-government schools. Joint programs are dealt with in Part IV of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The allocation for the severely handicapped children's program has been increased by 25 per cent or $0.7m in real terms. The same real level of funds will be provided for the professional development program for 1983, including funds for education centres.
       </para>
       <para>
        Allocations of grants for 1983 for the various programs for the States and the Northern Territory, are detailed in Schedules 1 to 11 of the Bill. These grants include provision of a prospective allowance for cost increases up to the end of 1983, in accordance with established government policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Grants for current programs for calendar year 1982 are adjusted under Part VI and Schedule 12 to help meet unanticipated cost increases arising from recent teacher salary determinations. The additional cost of these adjustments is $45m.

        An amendment has been made to the relevant clause in Part V of the Bill to enable the Commonwealth Minister to delegate all or any of his powers under the Act, other than that of delegation. This will improve the administration of programs and I will be considering carefully which matters should be retained for ministerial decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions of this Bill demonstrate the Commonwealth's continuing commitment to high standards in all Australian schools, whether government or non-government. The increased overall level of support will enable further real improvements in the recurrent resource levels of all schools in Australia. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

       <para>
        I tabled in the Senate on 9 September, the report of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission for 1983. This report was in response to the Government's guidelines for financial assistance for capital and equipment programs for universities and colleges of advanced education, and capital, equipment and recurrent programs for technical and further education institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 to implement the Government's decisions for 1983 on the financial recommendations made by the Commission, all of which have been accepted. Higher education recurrent grants for the 1982-84 triennium were determined by the Government in 1981 under the existing fixed triennial arrangements; however these are adjusted in the Bill to take account of recent Government decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation currently before the Senate takes account of recent amendments moved and accepted in the other place. The main reason for these amendments was to express all 1983 and 1984 allocations in the Bill in 1983 outturn prices, and to adjust 1982 recurrent grants where appropriate, to take account of recent Government decisions to provide additional funds in 1982 to help universities and colleges of advanced education meet the cost of recent salary increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has agreed to provide an additional $34.7m to universities and colleges of advanced education in 1982. This is to help meet the cost of the seven per cent salary increase for all academics in higher education institutions recently recommended by the Academic Salaries Tribunal and approved by the Government, and recent salary increases for non-academic staff. However, consistent with the Government's decision to provide institutions with a prospective allowance for cost increases and to encourage them to live within that overall provision, the institutions themselves will be required to absorb a small part of the total cost of these salary increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1983, capital grants will total $163.3m of which $46.2m is for universities and colleges of advanced education, and $117.1m is for TAFE.
       </para>
       <para>
        Equipment grants for 1983 total $69.2m for universities and colleges of advanced education and $10.4m for TAFE special equipment grants.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recurrent grants for TAFE for 1983 amount to $106.1m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the principal Act, certain institutions of higher education do not have recurrent grants appropriated for 1983 and 1984. Consolidation arrangements were recommended by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and were required by the Government's decisions arising from its Review of Commonwealth Functions. Consolidation arrangements have now been made for 26 of the 30 CAEs listed in the RCF decision. These include an amalgamation of the Institute of Early Childhood Development and Melbourne State College which has now been agreed by the Victorian Government. Funds have therefore been included in this legislation for the new amalgamated institution for 1983 and 1984.
       </para>
       <para>
        Acceptable proposals have yet to be made in respect of Armidale CAE, Newcastle CAE, Milperra CAE and SCV Hawthorn.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its report the Commission has noted the progress being made towards integration of the activities of the University of Newcastle and Newcastle CAE under a single governing body and towards consolidation of activities of SCV Hawthorn. It has suggested an appropriate approach to the consolidation of the activities of Milperra CAE. At Armidale there has also been some progress towards the development of arrangements to integrate the activities of the university with those of the college. The Government strongly supports the view of the Commission that 'higher education in Armidale and the surrounding region would benefit from an amalgamation of the university and the college' and looks forward to receiving an acceptable proposal from the New South Wales Government for such an amalgamation in the near future.
       </para>

        The Commonwealth Government has the responsibility for funding higher education and the responsibility to provide the best possible education services to the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shift in Australian demography has required fundamental changes in the structure of higher education as so much of that system related to teacher education. The consolidation of these remaining institutions will complete the comprehensive re-organisation of higher education which was recommended by the CTEC and supported by the Review of Commonwealth Functions. It is essential that we enter calendar year 1983 with a re-organised system which will provide improved and expanded opportunities for higher education.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the circumstances, the Government has decided that recurrent funds for all the institutions concerned, including the two universities, be put aside in a National Unallocated grant. These funds will be allocated by the Minister after advice from the Commission, when acceptable proposals are recommended in repect of the institutions which have not yet met the Commonwealth's requirements on consolidation. This means that acceptable proposals will need to be available by the end of 1982. I am anxious for the institutions and State governments concerned to produce acceptable proposals before the end of the year so that I can make these funds available.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its report the Commission also considered the future of the Orange Agricultural College. The Commission has expressed support for an amalgamation of Orange Agricultural College and Mitchell CAE. While the Government considers there are advantages in the college entering into suitable arrangements with another institution, it is not specifying which other institution should be involved. The Government has agreed that separate funding for Orange Agricultural College should continue in 1983 but it expects that the college will move towards entering into an appropriate consolidation arrangement by January 1984. This means that the college and all concerned will certainly have until the end of 1983 to develop acceptable future arrangements. For this reason the Bill includes the 1984 recurrent funds for Orange Agricultural College in the National Unallocated Grant for Higher Education.
       </para>
       <para>
        Higher education recurrent grants include provision for up to an additional $4. 4m in 1983 and $8.8m in 1984 to assist institutions to meet increased superannuation costs. These grants will assist with the cost of the new national superannuation scheme developed by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee and the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations. This new scheme is designed to replace existing arrangements which give inadequate benefits to many staff. In addition, the grants will assist with the problem of meeting increased costs resulting from membership of State government superannuation schemes with a view to limiting these costs to the level of the new AVCC/FAUSA scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additional recurrent grants of $0.2m in 1983 and $0.3m in 1984 have been included in the Bill for the University of Melbourne to assist with the development of graduate teaching and research in management education. This results from the Government's consideration of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Management Education-the Ralph Report. The provision of up to $4.6m as the Commonwealth contribution towards the construction of a building for the new graduate school of management at the University of Melbourne will be finalised following the Government's consideration of further proposals to be developed for the establishment and management of the school. These proposals will include the active co-operation and involvement of the Australian business community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the Government's consideration of the evaluation of post-arrival programs and services for migrants by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs, the Government decided that 15 per cent of TAFE particular purpose grants will be allocated for implementing programs of advanced English language instruction for migrants. The Commission is consulting with the States on the implementation of this program and will report shortly on the most appropriate method of giving full effect to the decision within 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        TAFE capital grants include financial assistance for the construction of seven major building projects and the design of a further two building projects under the new three-year $60m National Priority Projects program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first instalment of this new three-year program, which is included in the Bill, will be $13.9m for 1983. This level of activity recognises that expenditure on new projects is inevitably less in the first year than occurs in later years. However, the Commission's recommendations provide for the full expenditure of the $60 allocated over the three years 1983-85.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The matters with which this Bill and its companion measures deal have been the subject of considerable public and political debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In bringing the measures before the Parliament the Government demonstrates once again its clear commitment to do what it can to establish and uphold a fair system of taxation in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has on behalf of the Government in recent years brought before the Parliament a very wide range of Bills designed so that those who would seek to escape their fair share of taxation do not succeed in that purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        By this legislation the Government complements its earlier proscription of schemes to evade the payment of legally payable company tax by a Bill that will recover evaded company tax from the principal beneficiaries of earlier evasion of that kind.
       </para>
       <para>
        In doing this we have sought to achieve a reasonable balance between all the various, and often conflicting, interests and considerations that seem to attend the more significant of taxation issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our normal and general reluctance to introduce taxation legislation having any retrospective element has, on this occasion, been tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the tax burden. We are also dealing here with recoupment of tax which was clearly the subject of illegal evasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that the public is clearly of the view that tax evaded in the course of pre-tax strips of company profits should be recovered for public purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation that is now before the Senate will result in both of the groups that have benefited financially from the evasion of company tax-vendors and promoters-being called on to make restitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in establishing by this Bill the rules under which accounts are to be settled, the Government has been anxious to ensure that the matter proceeds on a properly measured basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this Bill observes these principles.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since this legislation was first foreshadowed by the Treasurer on 25 July 1982, the Government's intention has always been that the tax recouped should be that tax that remains unpaid as a result of arrangements which have resulted in illegal evasion of tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tax that may have been avoided either by the former owners of companies or by the companies themselves is not the subject of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That point needs to be made clear not only so that the ambit of the Bill is properly understood, but also so that some of the wilder claims about the numbers of companies that have been stripped of untaxed profits can be seen to be as unfounded as they are.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where companies were simply stripped of profits that have borne all the company -including undistributed profits-tax payable on them, there has been no evasion of tax and the legislation will not apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nor will it apply to the taxed profits element in the case of a strip of both taxed and untaxed company profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only the tax on the untaxed profits is the subject of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        But let me remind the Senate that, with effect from 27 May 1981 when we brought in the new general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, vendor-shareholders are to be taxed on any profits liberated to them in the course of a dividend strip or other similar strip of company profits .
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to those situations where companies which have been sold had themselves entered into tax avoidance schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking about this area, let me immediately lay at rest a notion entertained by some people that the legislation will recover tax that was escaped only because of the involvement of the companies in avoidance schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will not. The only tax to be recovered under the legislation is tax that was legally payable, and the payment of which has been illegally evaded.
       </para>
       <para>
        This follows from the provisions in the legislation that make recoupment tax payable only where company tax legally payable remains unpaid, former owners having had the opportunity to contest the commissioner's contention that company tax is payable.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the commissioner, with full knowledge of the situation, has allowed a deduction created under a tax avoidance scheme, that would conclude the matter, and there would now be no claim for tax based on challenge to that scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before the Senate is set against the background of three broad situations in which companies have been sold and company tax legally payable remains unpaid.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first and most obvious one is a straight-out asset strip with a clear intention of leaving the company unable to pay its tax liabilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Included within that category are those situations where a company is sold after it has been assessed to tax by the commissioner following his rejection of an earlier avoidance scheme that the company had entered into.
       </para>
       <para>
        A second category is the one where after the sale of the company the company has been put into what purports to be a tax avoidance scheme but it is one that, in substance, is part of an arrangement to render the company unable to pay its tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        And the third situation is one where after the sale of the shares the company was also put into an avoidance scheme which could reasonably have been regarded at the time as being effective of its simple tax avoidance purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to each of the second and third categories I note that the commissioner's action in contesting the legal efficacy of the schemes is not something that he is only now doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        He has had the widest range of avoidance schemes under challenge and, as I have already indicated, a situation of any possible relevance to the Bill would only arise when, and to the extent that, when the courts do pass judgment on the schemes, they find them to fail at law, so that tax is legally payable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before the Senate puts the first and second categories within the scope of the recoupment tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each clearly has an element of fraud attaching to the arrangement at some point or another.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third category is different, as it can fairly be put that, because the avoidance scheme could not be said to be part of the arrangement to leave the company unable to meets its tax liabilities, an element of fraud is not present.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, there is a specific provision in the Bill to the effect that if the target company was the subject of a post-sale attempted avoidance scheme which, objectively viewed, would have had reasonable prospects of succeeding in its purpose, and the scheme is not part of, or associated with, the stripping arrangement so that the arrangement carried no purpose of rendering the company unable to pay, there will be no recoupment tax liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        In line with that, the recoupment legislation will also not apply where there was a pre-saled avoidance scheme which, though ultimately shown to be unsuccessful, might reasonably have been expected to have worked, if at the time of the sale the commissioner had not raised an assessment rejecting the claims made under the scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I turn now to the details of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Vendors
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures to collect evaded tax are to operate on strips of untaxed profits that were carried out between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980, when the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 dealt a decisive blow to such schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just as the legislation applies to arrangements that have a purpose of rendering a company unable to pay its tax, so the present Bill will declare that it is to operate only where there has been an arrangement that had the effect that a company was rendered unable to pay its company tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other precise tests of the legislation are also of an objective nature, helping to make clear its field of operation, and I now outline them, taking first the simpler forms of company structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer said in his statement of 25 July that the legislation would apply where all the shares in a company were sold.
       </para>
       <para>
        Scheme promoters needed to have total control of a company before they could effect the strip that was a part of the overall arrangement.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it was possible for them to do this where less than the entire ownership was acquired and the Bill accordingly, on the basis of company law provisions, makes it a condition for its application that there was a sale of shares carrying more than 90 per cent of the voting power in the target company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Typically, schemes of the kind dealt with by this Bill involved a sale of shares and the Bill treats for what it is, a sale and purchase of shares, an arrangement under which former owners mortgaged their shares in return for receipt of a loan, and then, as pre-arranged, defaulted in repayment so that the shares were forfeited or otherwise fell into the hands of the promoter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The loan proceeds were of course effectively the sale price of the shares and the legislation will apply accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet again, the Bill provides that its basic test of disposal of shares carrying more than 90 per cent of the voting power of the company will be operative in those situations where shares are sold by a person who had formerly exercised control by reason of holding an office such as that of governing director.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another important test is framed so that it is clear that the legislation will apply only where the vendor-shareholders and other former owners actually derived a benefit from the evasion of the company's tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is achieved by a provision that requires that the total consideration for the sale of the shares in the company exceeded its net assets as reduced by any actual or contingent company tax liability on income derived up to the time of sale of the shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        To put it another way, the test is one that puts into legal terms the concept that the sale price for the company was such that it was evident that company tax on the amount of then apparent profits simply would not be paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        A person who pays, say, $90,000 for shares in a company that has traded for part of the income year and earned $100,000, which is what the company has in the bank, cannot be regarded as in a position to pay the $46,000 company tax payable on a taxable income of $100,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The liability of former owners of a company under the legislation will not arise until the company's liability has been established by assessment, rights of objection and appeal against that assessment have either not been exercised or have been exhausted, and tax remains unpaid.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this regard, former owners of a company will not be called on to effect recoupment of the company tax under this legislation until after they have had an opportunity to contest the basic assessment of that tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commissioner of Taxation has already issued many notices of assessment in respect of the companies concerned, but due to the fact that some have been returned unclaimed, and to other circumstances, these notices are a less than satisfactory foundation for tax claims on the former owners.
       </para>
       <para>
        As soon as practicable after this legislation is passed, therefore, a copy of the already-issued notice of assessment will in each case be sent to all former shareholders, the only qualification being that the person's whereabouts is known or, in the case of a company, that it is not dormant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, to ensure that the group that can object on the company's behalf is sufficiently representative, the representative group, each of whom is to get a copy of the company assessment, is to include up to 5 further people who were owners of the company further along a chain of ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        The representative group, acting by majority, may under the Bill then appoint one of their number who will be able to exercise the rights of objection and appeal open to the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The obligation of former owners to meet any late payment penalty owing by the company will be measured only from the date that would be the due date for payment if the company assessment had been served on the day that the copy is sent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer said in his statement of 25 July that the legislation will not apply where the reason for non-payment of company tax is that a company has suffered commercial misadventure in the hands of its new owners, following its sale at a commercially realistic price.
       </para>
       <para>
        To make that clear, the legislation specifies that it will apply only where the company did not, after the sale, carry on the same business as it had carried on beforehand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where the various threshold tests are all met each vendor-shareholder will, at base, be liable to effect recoupment of his or her share of the evaded tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        That amount will be fixed according to the vendor's share of the total consideration for the sale of shares in the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        In noting that the vendor-shareholders will be liable to recoup the total amount of the evaded company tax, undiminished by the part of that tax taken as a fee by those who promoted the scheme and stripped the company, I also observe that payments of recoupment tax by the promoter's group in a particular case will reduce the amount of recoupment tax payable by the former owners.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that recoupment tax obligations will extend to vendor-shareholders in a company who sold shares and thereby, in association with other shareholders concerned, transferred control in yet another company which was stripped of untaxed company profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        A sale of shares in a holding company that carried ownership of a series of subsidiary companies with untaxed profits is an example.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether a sale of shares took place in one of these more complex situations, or in the simple case I dealt with earlier, some of the vendor-shareholders will have been companies or trusts through which people held ownership of the stripped companies, and there could also have been more lengthy chains of ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        The broad aim of the legislation is to effect recoupment at the earlier practicable and appropriate stage along a chain of ownership but where, in defined circumstances, that cannot be achieved the Bill has provisions for tracing through, broadly on the basis of rights to capital, the liability from one level to another, so that ultimately it rests on the people who indirectly owned the stripped companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Persons who at a primary or secondary level are liable to the recoupment tax that is being formally imposed as a technique for recovering the evaded tax will be issued with a notice of assessment setting out the amounts each is liable to pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        A recipient of such a notice will of course have the usual rights of objection and appeal against a recoupment tax assessment and, if the tax remains unpaid 30 days after the notice is issued, the unpaid amount will thereafter attract late payment penalty at the rate of 20 per cent per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        On review, we have concluded that that rate, rather than the earlier-announced rate of 30 per cent would be appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Associated with that, a separate Bill that I will shortly introduce will implement the earlier-announced decision to propose a doubling-from 10 per cent to 20 per cent-in the rate of penalty for late payment of income tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        This further Bill will have the effect that late payment penalty begins to accrue as soon as is practicable at the higher rate of 20 per cent in the basic assessments of company tax issued or to be re-issued in respect of the stripped companies concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        In noting that unpaid undistributed profits tax is within the scope of the recoupment legislation, I observe that in harmony with existing provisions in the income tax law the former owners of a company may arrange instead to pay tax themselves on the same basis as if the company had distributed enough in dividends to escape a liability to undistributed profits tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        A feature of the Bill of broad significance is the offer of limited time to pay to former owners who decide not to contest their liability under the legislation and who make satisfactory arrangements with the Commissioner of Taxation for payment of the unpaid company tax on which their liability to pay recoupment tax would be based.
       </para>
       <para>
        The general background is, of course, that, as the Treasurer has indicated, the Government hopes that former owners will simply arrange to pay the company tax and the Bill is structured so that any payment of company tax by them will not operate to diminish the promoters' liability to the tax in respect of the stripped company concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The kind of arrangement for which the Bill makes provision is one where the former owners agree to pay the unpaid company tax in instalments over a period- normally of up to 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        They would, at the time of making an arrangement with the Commissioner, need to make an initial payment of part of the tax and, if the arrangement for subsequent payments was adhered to, they would not be liable for any late payment penalty. Nor would they be liable to pay recoupment tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision in the Bill for this time to pay recognizes that some persons who will be liable under the legislation may need to dispose of assets and takes into account such things as possible effects on employment that immediate payment of the tax could have.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another provision in the Bill will mean that if the underlying company tax liability is contested by some of the former owners of the company, but others wish immediately to pay their share of the evaded tax, they can do so without incurring any liability for late payment penalty that would arise from the delay brought about by the company assessment being put into dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier-foreshadowed provisions to guard against divestment of assets in an attempt to frustrate the operation of the recoupment legislation are another feature of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amoung further provisions of note are measures-
       </para>
       <para>
        to adopt the machinery and collection provisions of the income tax law;
       </para>
       <para>
        to ensure that, secrecy provisions of the tax law notwithstanding, persons liable to vendors recoupment tax are able to get details of the basis on which their liability was calculated and, to assist them in any personal pursuit of promoters for compensation, of the ways in which their company was stripped;
       </para>
       <para>
        to make appropriate adjustments in a former owner's liability where other amounts of, or representing, the unpaid company tax are paid;
       </para>
       <para>
        to deal with situations where a stripped company has ceased to exist; and
       </para>
       <para>
        to give the Commissioner of Taxation authority not to pursue liability in particular circumstances, including where a former owner's liability under the legislation is under $100.
       </para>

       <para>
        Mr President, I turn now to a discussion of the liability of promoters and other strippers to assist in making good the evasion of tax that has occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our appointment of a special prosecutor, and the work that he will carry out, can be expected to make some contribution, but the Government is not content to let it rest there.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation will also place a liability on those who were on the post-sale side of these schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The popular conception of who is a promoter of schemes to strip companies of untaxted profits does not help us all that much in framing the kind of tests which the legislation must express.
       </para>
       <para>
        The connection of promoters with the schemes they devised or marketed was one that varied substantially from promoter to promoter and is not capable of simple expression.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Bill contains a series of formal tests that describe which persons are to be treated as 'promoters' under the legislation or, in the terms used in the Bill, as being members of the eligible promoters class.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only are promoters, as popularly understood, to be put into the eligible promoters class, but so too are those people, typically members of a promoter's family, who directly or indirectly had ownership rights in the companies and trusts through which promoters normally operated, and in that way received or stood to receive benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Included within the eligible promoters class will be those who purchased shares from vendor-shareholders, were shareholders or directors of a purchasing company , were beneficiaries or trustees of a purchasing trust or were directors of a corporate trustee.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also included will be legal or beneficial owners through one or more further companies or trusts in a chain of ownership extending behind the purchasing company or trust.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similar provision will be made where the promoter's formal connection was as agent for the purchaser or as broker, and where a person who was an associate of a purchaser from vendor-shareholders gave financial assistance in the purchase of the shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        If by a loan that had the real character of a distribution of income or capital a person stripped moneys from a company or trust that is in the eligible promoters class, the person will also be included in the class.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill places on all the persons who are in the eligible promoters class in relation to a stripped company, a joint and several liablity for recoupment tax in relation to that company.
       </para>
       <para>
        That means that each person in the class is fundamentally, but subject to rights of contribution and apportionment of liablity that I will mention shortly , liable for the whole of the recoupment tax attaching to that group of persons.
       </para>
       <para>
        That feature, allied with the necessity to put persons into the eligible promoters class on the basis of their formal legal connections, for example as shareholder in a company, could lead to some people such as an office secretary being made liable when she does not either really participate in or benefit from the scheme otherwise than as an employee.
       </para>
       <para>
        Simply for that combination of reasons, there is provision in the Bill under which a person can achieve exclusion from the eligible promoters class by obtaining a Federal court declaration excluding the person from the class.
       </para>
       <para>
        As another aspect of the joint and several liability on persons in an eligible promoters class, a person who has in consequence paid some or all of the recoupment tax attaching to that class may seek through the courts an appropriate contribution from other members of the class.
       </para>
       <para>
        While that basic consequence of joint and several liability is to remain a feature of the Bill, we have been pursuaded that a person who, under the joint and several concept, is sued by the Commissioner ought not to be required first to pay the tax before he or she seeks contribution from the others.
       </para>
       <para>
        This could be particularly so where the appropriate share of the person sued is a relatively small part of the total Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Bill contains provision under which a person in the promoters class who is sued by the Commissioner for unpaid promoters recoupment tax may act to have other members of the class joined as co-defendants to the recovery suit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where that option is exercised the court will, having regard to levels of participation and benefit enjoyed or to be enjoyed, have power to determine how much of the unpaid amount it is just and equitable that the person sued, and each of the persons joined, should be liable to pay as recoupment tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The basic tests for determining whether 'promoters' are liable to recoupment tax will accord with those for vendor-shareholders, except that there will not be the test, applicable to vendors, that measures sale proceeds against the pre- sale net assets of the target company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the Bill will be that the 'promoters' group will generally be liable to recoupment tax equal to 20 per cent of vendors' liability, that is, 20 per cent of the total of unpaid primary company tax, any unpaid division 7 tax and any late payment penalty accruing after vendors are notified of the company liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mention that 20 per cent reflects the average amount of evaded tax that promoters took as fees for the service they provided to vendor-shareholders.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in those pre-tax profits strip cases where vendors are not liable to recoupment tax-for example, where a tax provision was paid to a promoter who did not use it to pay the company tax-the relevant 'promoters' group will be liable for recoupment tax equal to the whole of such unpaid company tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been put to us that this fixed percentage liability on those in the promoters group could operate inappropriately where, in a particular case, the fee charged was at a substantially lower level.
       </para>
       <para>
        This could, for example, happen where the amount of profits stripped from a particular company was large, and the fee was, as a percentage of profits, somewhat lower.
       </para>
       <para>
        To meet this situation the Bill will place a ceiling on the total recoupment tax liability that attaches to the promoters class for a particular scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        That ceiling will be the amount of the gross fee charged by the promoter, that is, in the simple case the difference between the net worth of the company at the time of sale (now unpaid tax liabilities aside) and the consideration for the purchase of the shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note the point that this ceiling is expressed in terms of total recoupment tax liability, such as in a case where there were a number of unpaid company assessments for the target company, perhaps involving more than one year of income.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of necessity, given that there was typically no dissection of fee between such different company tax liabilities of a company or, in a case where accumulated profits were also involved, between the amount charged for pre-tax and accumulated profits, the fee limitation expressed in the Bill is in terms of the total fee regardless of how it was calculated or on which profits it might have been based.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those situations where the 'promoters' share of the evaded tax is 20 per cent, the Bill retains a full liability on the vendors, but to the extent that the 'promoters' group pays its 20 per cent share, the recoupment tax liability of the former owners of the company concerned will be correspondingly reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, that completes my explanation at this stage of the main features of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        An explanatory memorandum providing a detailed explanation of the various measures contained in the Bill has been made available to honourable senators, the main memorandum being complemented by a supplementary memorandum that deals particularly with changes made to the Bill during its consideration by the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will be apparent, I believe, that the Government, after careful consideration of the many points of view that have been put about this legislation, is sticking to it and its basic concepts.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will be clear that we have positively responded to reasonable criticisms of the measures as announced by the Treasurer and as originally introduced in the other place.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that light, I commend that Bill to the Senate.

        This fourth Bill in the legislative package to recover tax illegally evaded in company stripping schemes proposes amendments to several Acts, consequential upon the three Bills I have already introduced. The first amendment is that of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Decisions under certain Acts are precluded from review through the system of review provided for by that Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Decisions under the new recoupment tax legislation are also to be excluded from the purview of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, a person liable to recoupment tax who receives an assessment in respect of his or her liability will have available full rights of objection and appeal to a taxation board of review or to the courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other taxation laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation that provide similar rights to contest liability are also excluded from review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendments of the other Acts-the Pay-Roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act, the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1), the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Act , the Tobacco Charges Assessment Act and the Wool Tax (Administration) Act are of a more technical nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of amendments made to these Acts in 1980 by the Taxation Debts ( Abolition of Crown Priority) Act, a liquidator or receiver of a company is permitted to satisfy secured debts and preferential debts under Commonwealth or State laws before payment of taxation debts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having made such payments a liquidator or receiver is required to set aside a proportionate part of the remaining assets for payment of income tax and various other taxes payable under the Acts I have referred to.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the remaining consequential amendments is to include in the calculation of the amount a liquidator or receiver of a company must set aside any liability of the company to recoupment tax.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking to the Bills I have just introduced to recover tax evaded in the course of 'bottom-of-the-harbour' strips of untaxed company profits I mentioned that I would be introducing a further Bill to double the rate of penalty for late payment of income tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill-which was on introduction in the House of Representatives was titled the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Additional Tax) Bill-will achieve that purpose, not just for companies that were stripped of assets but also for all individuals and other companies that are late in paying their income tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will also provide for an income tax deduction for payments of promoters recoupment tax made under the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to details of this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 10 August 1982 the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced the Government's intention to propose an increase from 10 per cent per annum to 20 per cent per annum in the rate of penalties payable under the various taxation laws for late payment of tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time he gave some details of the Government's intention to introduce a system for payment of interest on a refund of tax that occurs as a result of a successful objection or appeal by a taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para>
        By this Bill, the income tax law will be amended to increase the rate of late payment penalty for late payment of income tax and related amounts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increase to 20 per cent will not, however, take effect until two months after this Bill has become law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new rate of penalty tax will apply in respect of the late payment of assessed income tax, withholding tax in interest and dividends paid to non- residents of Australia, mining withholding tax and tax instalment deductions made by an employer from salaries or wages paid to employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes a corresponding increase in the rate of additional tax payable where the taxable income of a company has been underestimated and the company has thereby been enabled to pay reduced instalments of company tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing income tax law empowers the Commissioner of Taxation to remit all or part of an amount of late payment penalty where that is judged to be appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where there is an objection or appeal against an assessment and the Commissioner accepts that the taxpayer has a genuine difference of opinion about his or her tax liability, the present general administrative practice of the Commissioner is, in the exercise of that power to remit, to enter into an arrangement with the taxpayer to remit all late payment penalty in the event that the taxpayer is not successful in his objection or appeal. This arrangement is on the basis that the taxpayer pays one-half of the tax in dispute pending the outcome of the objection or appeal-it has been called a 50-50 arrangement.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will re-express the power given to the Commissioner of Taxation to remit late payment penalty, so that this particular approach to the handling of disputed income tax liabilities will not be available in future.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commissioner will of course continue to be empowered to remit late payment penalty where there are special circumstances, such as adverse business conditions or other factors beyond the control of the taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the remission power is to be altered for the future, existing 50-50 arrangements will be allowed to continue according to their terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also make the point that under the legislation we propose that a person who has a genuine dispute about liability will be able to pay to the Commissioner one-half of the disputed tax and obtain an extension of time for payment of the balance on the basis that, if the taxpayer wins the contest, he or she will be paid interest when the 50 per cent is refunded but, if the taxpayer loses, the Commissioner will be entitled to recover the remaining 50 per cent subject to late payment penalty of 20 per cent from the date when the assessment became payable.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has not been practicable to include in this Bill the measures necessary to provide for the payment of interest to taxpayers.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are committed to these measures and, although it has not been possible to prepare the necessary legislation for introduction in these sittings, a Bill incorporating these measures will be introduced early in the autumn sittings.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also remains the Government's intention to introduce in the autumn sittings legislation dealing with late payment penalties in respect of sales tax and other taxes administered by the Commissioner of Taxation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have explained in my second reading speech on introduction of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill, there is to be payable by promoters of schemes to strip companies of pre-tax profits a share of the company tax evaded by those companies. This share is to be collected by imposition of a promoters recoupment tax on a promoters taxable amount and will be limited to the gross fee charged on the acquisition of the target company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such a fee would generally have the character of income in the hands of the promoter concerned, and it can be said that collection of both income tax and the recoupment tax would amount to a double imposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government sees the strength of that argument.
       </para>
       <para>
        The broad notion behind imposition of the recoupment tax on promoters is that the promoters should never have benefited by the evasion of company tax, and that the recoupment tax will return from them the fees that represent their share of the evaded tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        To put it another way, the promoters fee that was received will by reason of the promoters recoupment tax, be required to be paid back.
       </para>
       <para>
        In these circumstances, the Government believes it to be appropriate that the income tax law should be made to apply to promoters' own liability to income tax as though they had never received the amounts that they in fact pay back as recoupment tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Government proposes by this Bill to allow as an income tax deduction for a person the amount that he or she pays as promoters recoupment tax, or as a contribution towards the promoters recoupment tax that another member of the particular promoters class has paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        This deduction will be allowable for the year in which the shares in the target company were purchased, but will not be allowed to give rise to a carry-forward loss.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, Mr President, I mention the review that has been going on in recent months of monetary and other penalties contained in the various taxation laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        We intend, again in the autumn sittings, to introduce further legislation to increase the effectiveness of the other penalty provisions of the taxation laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part of the review of penalties has focused on the rate of additional tax payable in cases involving international profit shifting arrangements, where avoidance that would otherwise occur has been eliminated by the new legislation brought in by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has not overlooked its undertaking given in the Senate earlier this year that the level of additional tax applicable to such profit shifting arrangements would be reviewed, and the results of that review will be announced shortly.
       </para>
       <para>
        An explanatory memorandum giving technical explanations of provisions of the Bill has been made available to honourable senators and I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The objective of this Bill is to give legislative recognition to basic human rights and freedoms and to provide remedies for their enforcement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In November 1973, then-Senator Murphy introduced a virtually identical Bill into this chamber. Unfortunately, the Bill was not proceeded with in the Senate and when Parliament was prorogued in February 1974, it lapsed. It was not re- introduced before the double dissolution was called in 1975.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like Senator Murphy's Bill, this Bill is based upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations on 10 December 1948, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a great deal of debate in legal and political circles about the extent of Commonwealth power to implement such international covenants. Earlier this year in the Racial Discrimination Act case, the High Court of Australia provided the basis for optimism that the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional authority to legislate with regard to matters of genuine international concern. The existence of a bona fide international covenant, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is an important element in determining the extent of that ''genuine international concern''.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is because of the Racial Discrimination Act case and because neither the Government nor the Australian Labor Party has shown any inclination to act, that the Australian Democrats have decided to proceed with a Human Rights Bill at this time. The Government's 1981 Human Rights Commission Act is a toothless tiger. The Commission has no coersive powers-it can only report and recommend on human rights problems. It cannot take even the most flagrant breaches of human rights to court and it has no jurisdiction at all in relation to the States, where some of the worst abuses of human rights occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, the Labor Party has shown no interest in effective human rights legisation since its 1973 Bill. It seems content to wait wistfully for the day when it returns to power, leaving the human rights issue to languish on the shelf.
       </para>
       <para>
        If ever there was a case for a matter of principle to override the considerations of party politics, it is the case for human rights. It is a national disgrace that our Constitution has no provisions to protect the fundamental rights and liberties of our citizens; that no serious attempt has been made to rectify that omission legislatively; and that Australia's ratification of the international covenant, which finally came in August 1980, was subject to so many reservations that the international legality of our ratification is unclear.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights covers such rights as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of movement, the rights of a person charged with a criminal offence, the protection of individual privacy, the right to vote and hold public office, and so on. These rights and freedoms are set out in this Bill, which would be binding on each State and Territory as well as the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Equally importantly, the Bill would provide the machinery to enforce those rights and protect those freedoms. Aggrieved persons would have access to the courts and the Australian Human Rights Commissioner will have the power to investigate breaches of human rights, either on his or her own initiative or on receipt of a complaint. Furthermore, unlike the impotent Human Rights Commission we have today, the Commissioner under this Bill will have the power to take legal proceedings on behalf of an aggrieved person.
       </para>
       <para>
        In some respects, this Bill modifies the 1973 Bill to take account of developments which have occurred in the intervening ten years. Many of these changes are simply drafting alterations to accord with current usage. More important, however, are the new versions of sections on the rights of the family , religious freedom and sexual preference.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1973 Bill provoked substantial opposition from lobbying groups which felt that there was inadequate protection for the family. This Bill recognises the family as the 'natural and fundamental unit of society', entitled to the protection of society and of the law. This provision is consistent with Article 23 of the international covenant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1973 Bill was opposed by some religious groups objecting to section 10 (4) of that Bill which would have permitted the Government to limit religious freedom with 'reasonable regulations as to time, place and manner'. The corresponding section in section 9 (4) of this Bill does not contain the controversial phrase. The revised section is an attempt to permit necessary limitations on dangerous activities which parade under the cover of 'religious beliefs', and yet to prohibit government interference with genuine religious practices.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 18 of the Bill deals with the freedom to manifest one's sexual preference without unlawful interference or discrimination. Although no corresponding section is in the international covenant, it is my view that such a provision is consistent with the spirit of the Covenant and would be constitutional. Freedom of sexual preference would be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law, and are reasonably necessary to protect public safety or public health or to preserve the rights of others.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part V of the Bill establishes an Australian Human Rights Council, which would assume the educational functions which are now carried out by the existing Human Rights Commission. As I have already indicated, the enforcement powers under the Act, which would be considerably greater than existing methods of enforcement of human rights violations, would rest with the Commissioner. These new enforcement powers are contained in Parts III and IV of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I believe that Australians have waited too long for the Commonwealth Government's protection of their basic human rights. They have suffered too long under the haphazard protection which is provided by the common law and those random legislative and constitutional provisions which may happen to touch on an area of human rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats would prefer, of course, that a Bill of Rights were written into the Australian Constitution. But, the road to constitutional amendment is difficult, long and uncertain. In the absence of a constitutionally -entrenched Bill of Rights, this legislation-which will be binding on Federal, State and local officials-represents the best available means of giving effect to the International Covenant and providing protection for the fundamental rights of all Australians. We hope that this statutory Bill of Rights will pave the way for a constitutional amendment in due course.
       </para>
       <para>
        A great deal of effort has gone into the area of human rights, by the Labor Party in its 1973 Bill, by the Liberal Party in its Human Rights Commission Bills of 1977, 1979 and 1981 and by the Australian Democrats with the Bill in its current form. I therefore respectfully urge my Senate colleagues of all political persuasions to lend their support to the passage of this Bill so that the rights of all Australians will have a firmer basis in law.

        —The Opposition will not oppose Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83. Since the Appropriation Bills were introduced into the House of Representatives on Budget night, it has become quite clear that the Budget estimates given in association with those Bills are, for whatever reason, wildly erroneous and that the deficit, officially estimated at that stage at $1.674 billion, will almost certainly blow out to something in excess of $3 billion and possibly reach a figure close to $4 billion. It has also become much clearer since the Bills were introduced into the Parliament that the Australian economy is headed for, and indeed has now reached, its most seriously recessed stage since the mid-1930s. Unemployment has risen drastically in the couple of intervening months and is clearly headed for much higher levels . Initial confirmation of the continuing increase in unemployment will undoubtedly appear before the end of this week.

       Interest rates, having a couple of weeks ago taken a small flutter downwards in some areas, are now clearly on the way up again. The degree to which the money market was fooled by the inaccurate estimates of the public sector borrowing requirement contained in the Budget may or may not have been a factor in the temporary flutter downwards of interest rates. But, however that may be, interest rates are clearly on the way up again and there is no possibility whatsoever in the foreseeable future of the sensitive business and home borrowing interest rates coming down. Indeed, if we were to believe the assertion frequently repeated by this Government in earlier years that there is a direct linkage between the size of the public sector borrowing requirement and the level of interest rates, we would have to conclude that interest rates will go up. Of course, that simplistic assertion was never correct. There are always other variables which affect interest rates, but the magnitude of the likely Budget deficit blowout is such that it is conceivable that interest rates will rise to even higher levels for that reason alone.

       The release of the September quarter consumer price index figure revealed the highest annual inflation rate that we have had since the December quarter of 1976 and, incidentally, an annual inflation rate which is higher than that which prevailed when this Government came to office. A simple but stark reminder of the failure of the economic policies of this Government is the fact that since it came to office the number of unemployed has doubled and, as well, the inflation rate has gone up. Plenty of other inept governments have managed to double unemployment levels. The Reagan Administration and the Thatcher Administration have almost succeeded in doubling unemployment, but only Malcolm Fraser has been able to double unemployment and push inflation up as well. In all of the other countries in which in recent times unemployment levels have rocketed, inflation has come down. The true measure of Malcolm Fraser's achievement as an economic manager is the fact that only he has managed to double the number of people unemployed and push inflation up as well. For the first time in more than 20 years, the Australian economy is actually shrinking. Although the official figures have not yet emerged, beyond doubt the volume of real gross domestic product is shrinking. At this moment, and almost certainly for this financial year as a whole, negative real GDP growth will be recorded- for the first time since the recession of 1961.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government attribute this economic disaster entirely to overseas factors, to external influences beyond the control of any Australian government, and say that nothing can be done. They adopt the completely negative position that nothing can be done until the world situation improves, that the most prudent course for any Australian government to pursue is that of ensuring that whenever that world upturn does occur we will be well placed to take advantage of it. The Australian Labor Party categorically rejects that negative thinking and admission of failure. Any government that is so bereft of ideas, so abject in its surrender, as to live by that sort of view is not fit to hold office.

       It might also be worth observing that the present Government view, or assertion , that the depression is caused by factors beyond the control of any Australian government, contradicts sharply the following view expressed by the present Prime Minister in January 1975 in addressing the ANZAAS conference:

        —The present Prime Minister said that in January 1975. That is what he said when he was in Opposition. When he is in government, presiding over the blackest depression we have seen since the mid 1930s, over the only period of negative economic growth that we have seen since 1961, he says by contrast: ' This is due to external factors that are absolutely beyond our control'. To the Prime Minister, on any matter, there is no such thing as a belief in anything, whether it concerns the ethics of tax dodging or the ethics of ripping off government programs such as the National Employment and Training System. There is no such thing as a belief. There is only ephemeral political convenience. In 1975 it was politically convenient to say that external influences were irrelevant. In 1982 it is politically convenient to say that external economic influences are the only relevant factor.

       Something which is far more important than the Prime Minister's habitual inconsistency, which I think is well known to everyone by now, is the simple fact that Australia's performance right now is poor when compared with the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the leading countries in that Organisation. Our performance throughout the second half of the 1970s has been poor. Contrary to the rhetoric of the Government, the statistical record shows that Australia fared very badly in the second half of the 1970s relative to the OECD as a whole and in particular in comparison with the leading OECD countries. Australia's performance compared with leading OECD countries is still poor. I do not want to cite too many statistics but I think it is essential to cite some.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the five calendar years from 1976 to 1980 inclusive-the source of the figures to which I refer is the OECD Economic Outlook No. 30 which was published in December 1981-the average rate of real growth in gross domestic product in Australia was 2.6 per cent. In the OECD as a whole it was 3.4 per cent. That was not startlingly high but it was significantly higher than ours. In leading OECD countries, such as Japan, the average growth rate was 5.1 per cent. In Austria it was 3.5 per cent and in West Germany it was 3.6 per cent. All of those figures were significantly higher than the figure which Australia recorded. Throughout the same period-the five calendar years from 1976 to 1980 inclusive- Australia's average rate of unemployment was 5.7 per cent. It was not much higher but it was still higher than the unemployment rate for the OECD as a whole which was 5.3 per cent. It was very much higher than the rate of 3.1 per cent in Japan, the rate of 1.9 per cent in Austria, where at no stage in those five years did it exceed 2.1 per cent, and the rate of 3.4 per cent in West Germany.
      </para>
      <para>
       The recession in Australia prior to this recession bottomed not in 1974 or 1975 , as it did in the rest of the industrialised world, but in 1977. Only for a very short period, which was associated with heavy investment in resources development 18 months to 30 months ago, was Australia's growth performance as good as that of the industrialised world as a whole. I refer of course to the much vaunted resources boom which was talked up recklessly by the Government for electoral purposes in 1980. The same Government now bewails one of the unintended but inevitable consequences of the reckless talking up of the resources boom-that is, the very high level of wage growth which has probably ceased to prevail now but which prevailed through most of 1981 and a good deal of 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       The most recent available statistics-some of them go back as far as May because the statistics for some OECD countries are not available until several months after the events which they record-indicate that Australia's inflation rate, currently standing at 12.3 per cent, is higher than that of Austria, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan, West Germany, Norway, France, Sweden, Canada and Finland. It is very much higher than the OECD average of 8.1 per cent. Our unemployment rate, currently standing at 7.4 per cent, is marginally below the OECD average. But it is still very much above-in fact it is more than double-the latest recorded unemployment rate for Austria which stood at 3.2 per cent, for Japan at 2.4 per cent, for Sweden at 3.1 per cent and for Norway at 2.5 per cent. The objective record shows that our position relative to the rest of the OECD is poor at this stage and that our record through the whole second half of the 1970s was poor compared with the OECD as a whole and dismal compared with that of the OECD leaders.
      </para>
      <para>
       Despite what the Prime Minister said in 1975, that external influences had absolutely nothing to do with what happened to the Australian economy, or what he says in 1982, that Australia is the passive victim of external forces over which it has no control, neither of those statements is true. The truth is that external influences do have some effect on the Australian economy. It is inevitable, given the magnitude of the world-wide recession, that some disadvantages would be imposed on Australia. But there are two very important factors. The Australian economy has been in a state of permanent recession relative to the rest of the industrialised world for all but one year since 1975 . In only one of the seven years that this Government has been in power has the Australian economy not been in recession relative to the rest of the OECD countries. The cumulative effect of that is that we go into a recession with an unemployment level of 6 per cent or 6 1/2 per cent. Then, as the recession bites and as the Government fails to take any compensatory action at all, inevitably that unemployment level will climb to somewhere between 9 per cent and 10 per cent, or maybe even 11 per cent, some time in the calendar year 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst it is correct that some downturn is inevitable, it is very important to note the starting point from which that downturn occurs. If unemployment were to go from 2 per cent to 3 per cent-as occurred in Japan and Austria-nobody would welcome it, but it would not be catastrophic. But in Australia it will go from 6 per cent to 9 per cent, 10 per cent or maybe 11 per cent. That is catastrophic and it is avoidable. It is possible to minimise the degree to which the Australian economy will drift into recession in the current period, and it was possible to have had a more satisfactory starting point at the beginning of the recession than we in fact had. The reason why neither the potential to minimise the present slump nor the potential to do very much better in the late 1970s has not been realised is that, in both cases, mistaken policies were pursued by this Government and it lacked moral authority. The common denominator of all of those countries that have recorded satisfactory economic statistics-a satisfactory level of economic performance measured by the things that everybody regards as important, such as growth rates, unemployment rates and inflation control-is that they have an effective prices and incomes policy, whether it is called that or not. Those countries include the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, Japan and Austria.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Australia, federal governments have very limited coercive power in that area . They have almost no direct coercive power. So it is essential, if a prices and incomes policy is to be successfully implemented, that the national government which seeks to implement it has, and deserves, moral authority. Implicit in the origin of this Government was that it would find it difficult to obtain any moral authority. After seven years in power, it neither has nor deserves any. For example, a government which has presided over massive tax evasion, about which it knew a good deal, both in aggregate and in detail, for five years and did nothing, is in a weak moral position to ask unions, or any group in the community, to restrain their demands on the economic product in the common interest. This Government, for reasons that had nothing to do with moral outrage but everything to do with electoral expediency, allowed billions and billions of dollars of revenue to be lost because income tax was being evaded and avoided.
      </para>
      <para>
       After the release of the Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reports the Government forecast its intention to legislate to recover a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars that had been evaded. Even had the Government sought to recover the lot, that would not have exempted it from the lion's share of the responsibility for what happened. It said it would legislate to recover some of that money-a tiny fraction. Since then, as a result of two major waterings down of the legislation originally introduced on 23 September, only a fraction of that tiny fraction will be recovered. The clause 3 (12) amendment inserted in the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill when it came back to the House of Representatives on 21 October exempts completely from liability the vendor shareholders of a particular class of company. I will not go into the details of that class of company because it is a terribly complex matter. However, about 700 companies-about one-sixth of the companies originally stated to have been covered by the legislation-have been exempted by that clause. A great deal more than one-sixth of the revenue has been lost because those companies tended to be companies with very much larger current year taxation liabilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       A particular company in this category is Treamog Ltd, which had a current year untaxed profit at the time it was flogged off of $3 1/2m. That clause 3 (12) amendment will exempt the vendor shareholders of Treamog from the liability to return that $3 1/2m, which I remind the Senate that the Prime Minister described only a couple of months ago as stolen money. That stolen money, thanks to the clause 3 (12) amendment, may now be retained by the people who stole it. The people who stole it-I use the Prime Minister's terminology-are the vendor shareholders of Treamog. I wonder who they are. It has been mentioned before but in case people have forgotten the principal vendor shareholder of Treamog was Denis Horgan, former finance committee chairman of the Western Australian Liberal Party. I charge this Government with inserting clause 3 (12) into the Bill with the conscious and deliberate intention of exempting Denis Horgan and other powerful figures in the Liberal Party from their obligation to return what the Prime Minister had previously designated as stolen money. In other words, if people are rich enough and have positions of power and influence in the Liberal Party they do not have to modify their demands for a share of the economic cake through the market place or the semi-regulated market place. They do not even have to return money which the Prime Minister said was stolen. Providing they are rich enough and influential enough they can make this Government water down the legislation, which it itself had introduced, in a way that will forgo the collection of several hundred millions of dollars of evaded taxation. What moral authority can any government which has done that expect to have or receive?

       The former member for Flinders is to retire with a lump sum pension entitlement , 95 per cent of which is tax free, of $470,000. If he were to die-that could happen to all of us at any time-his widow would receive for the rest of her life a pension of $39,000 a year in 1982 value dollars, indexed for life. That will occur even though the pension has already been commuted. What moral authority does a government that presides over that system have when it tells the ordinary working people of Australia to moderate their demands on the economic product? The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) granted himself in 1964 a 4 3/4 per cent government loan to purchase a house in Canberra. Of the principal of the loan, 82 per cent still has not been repaid and the Deputy Prime Minister still has that government loan at an interest rate of 4 3/4 per cent. Ordinary wage earners and working people are paying from 13 per cent to 16 per cent or 17 per cent. What moral authority does a government which presides over that situation have when it asks ordinary working people to modify their demands on the economic product?

       This Government, in this Appropriation Bill, filched $1.5m in a one-line appropriation-it was put down in the name of the Department of the Treasury-to run a political advertising campaign for the Liberal Party for the election that the Prime Minister planned to have this year. I understand that the Secretary to the Treasury personally remonstrated with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) over this gross misuse of public money. Indeed, I would be very disappointed in Mr Stone if he failed to do so because whatever policy disagreements people on this side of the House may have with him he has always been regarded as a very proper custodian of public funds. What moral authority can a government that did that expect to have?
      </para>
      <para>
       I could go through a number of similar items but time does not permit me to do so. I want to make this appeal to the Government: If there is anything to be learnt from the empirical evidence that is available around the world, it is that without a social consensus on a prices and incomes policy the goals which we on this side of the House, and even, I submit, the majority of people on the other side of the House want-the goals of full employment, rates of economic growth high enough to sustain full employment and low rates of unemployment- cannot be achieved unless an effective prices and incomes policy is put in place . An effective prices and incomes policy cannot be put in place, firstly, unless the Government aspires to put one in its place, which so far this Government has not chosen to do, and secondly, unless it has the moral authority to expect to be taken seriously when it asks the ordinary working people of Australia to accept that discipline.

        —I want to deal with some policy issues which concern a very large proportion of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83. More than $4,000m is to be spent this year by the Department of Defence and the Department of Defence Support. There is a very real danger in the area of defence that we will always be preparing for the last war or the the last war but one and that we will sink into an equipment and policy rut. The recent Falkland Islands campaign provided a unique opportunity to assess the performance of modern maritime weapons. It was in fact the first significant maritime war for nearly 40 years. Of course, it also provided an opportunity to see the performance of other weapons, but these were less important because the various Middle East wars provided much information on the performance of those weapons. I do not want to deal today with any of the moral questions involved in the Falklands dispute or the political questions, such as how the British permitted the Islands to be taken in the first place and what Britain will do now that the Islands have been recaptured. These are fascinating questions but they are irrelevant to the Bill before us and also irrelevant to my purpose, which is to point out the lessons which we can learn and which may affect the future equipment and training of the Australian Defence Force.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Before I do that I should point out that the Falklands operation was a one-off. It was an amphibious operation carried out at a range of 8,000 miles and without local air superiority. In fact, it was carried out with a 10:1 air inferiority. Although it worked on this occasion I hope that such an operation will never be attempted again-at any rate, not attempted by us. Indeed, when the difficulties of the Falklands operation became clear, particularly with the onset of winter, the only comparable operation I could think of was the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish in 1588. Before the armada sailed a senior Spanish officer, probably the second in command, Vice Admiral de Recalde, felt the operation was impossible, but he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . it is well known that we fight in God's cause. So . . . God will surely arrange matters . . . by depriving the English of their wits . . . But unless God helps us by a miracle the English . . . will knock us to pieces . . . So we are sailing against England in the confident hope of a miracle.
      </para>
      <para>
       As it turned out, in the Falklands the Argentinians were deprived of their wits. The British servicemen, with excellent professional skills, were very successful . This is not to denigrate all the Argentinian forces. The Argentine Air Force in particular attacked with commendable courage and continued to attack though suffering very severe losses. In fact, at the end of the campaign it was virtually wiped out as an effective fighting force. Although the precise circumstances of the Falklands operation will not recur one can easily imagine circumstances where we might have to take similar action, though at a shorter range, on a smaller scale and in less unfavourable weather conditions. The capability to mount a small scale amphibious assault at short notice is one which our Defence Force should certainly have. It is an option which must be available to the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       What lessons can we learn from the Falklands campaign? The first lesson is the impressive speed with which the British reacted after being initially caught by surprise. Merchant ships were requisitioned and converted, fitted with helicopter platforms, communications and, in some cases, guns. Although it was not done, one would have liked installed launchers to launch chaff to decoy missiles. All this was done very rapidly and with a speed that reflected sound prior planning. The British were lucky that, as part of their North Atlantic Treaty Organisation contingency planning, they had an organisation in readiness to deploy marines in the Arctic Circle in Northern Norway. Much of the equipment and much of the organisation for that part of Britain's strategy was also suitable for use in the South Atlantic in the Falklands. Nevertheless, the prior planning was impressive. I very much doubt whether we are doing any comparable planning.
      </para>
      <para>
       One point which I am sure will not have escaped logisticians is that one of the crucial shortages of the British was the shortage of tankers. That throws into highlight the fact that the new replenishment ship being built for the Royal Australian Navy is already two years behind schedule. Its failure to be delivered means that there is a serious weakness in our Defence Force. Australia would have a significant amphibious capability if we had an aircraft carrier which also incorporated some troop carrying capacity. We have the HMAS Tobruk, which is similar to the Sir Lancelot class used so successfully in the Falklands , six heavy landing craft and the troop and vehicle carrier HMAS Jervis Bay. What we need is a survey of which Australian flag merchant ships could usefully be requisitioned to support a small scale amphibious operation-say, two battalion strength-and what modifications would be necessary, such as helicopter decks and so on, so that designs could be prepared and materials stockpiled. I regret to say that I am not sure that this has not yet been done.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was disappointed a few months ago when I suggested that the Department of Defence should look at the proposed over-the-beach supply ship for the Antarctic Division to see what modifications should be incorporated to make it suitable for Navy use in defence emergencies. The lack of interest by the Department of Defence was deafening. We used to have a program whereby all Australian-built merchant ships had incorporated during construction the necessary stiffening for gun mountings and the fittings for degausing equipment and so on. This program has long since gone by the board. We should reinstate one tailored to our modern needs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other impressive aspect of the British preliminary moves was the speed with which the initial land force was assembled. The Royal Marines provided three battalions and the Parachute Brigade two battalions within two days. I have pointed out to the Senate before that the Royal Marine Corps, with 11,000 men, has five immediately available battalions, whereas the Australian Army, with 32, 000 men, has only two immediately available battalions-and neither of these is trained in either amphibious or parachute operations. What we need in our Army is more immediately available battalions trained in both airborne and amphibious operations. The Army should drop its nonsense of a regular army division, which imposes immense overheads but has no usable output. There is no way a regular division would ever be committed to battle. Any savings that we can make in our peacetime manpower would be very usefully diverted to capital equipment. After all, it costs about $1m a year to maintain a regular army platoon.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final point about the preparatory phase of the Falklands campaign is that we shall have to revise our ideas about how long troops can remain on board ship without losing their fighting edge. Conventional wisdom was that four or five days would be the limit, particularly in the bad weather of the South Atlantic in winter and the cramped conditions on board the two aircraft carriers and the other troop carrying vessels. The ships seemed to steam interminably up and down the coast of South America, yet the troops were certainly fighting fit when they landed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Turning to the actions around the Falklands, I should make it clear once again that this was an extraordinary operation-the only amphibious operation that has ever been attempted, let alone succeeded, without local air superiority. This forced some very dangerous tactical decisions, such as operating destroyers close inshore, where they were very vulnerable to surprise air attack. The destroyers had to be there to defend the landing craft and troop ships, such as the Canberra, as well as providing artillery support for the troops ashore. At least close inshore they were safe from Exocet missiles, which are not effective close inshore as they tend to home in on the land rather than on the ships.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that the Exocet missiles were the sensation of the campaign. They are not unique. They are similar, but with very much lower performance, to the Harpoon missiles with which our ships, submarines and aircraft are equipped. The Harpoon has roughly twice the range of the Exocet. As far as I can determine , about 12 Exocets were launched during that campaign-some from shore and some from aircraft-and three hit, which is a 25 per cent success rate. There is no doubt that the British were seriously underequipped to deal with the Exocets.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are four areas of defence against such missiles. The first is to shoot down low flying aircraft before they launch their missiles. This requires airborne early warning radar sets, to give warning of the approaching aircraft, and fighters with pulse-doppler radar sets so that low flying aircraft can be distinguished from sea returns. The British had neither. The second area of defence occurs when the missile is launched, when the defending ships need radar and radio intercept sets to give warning. In at least one case, the attack on the destroyer Sheffield, the British warning system failed completely. I hope that our Navy is informed of what happened.
      </para>
      <para>
       After missile detection the need is for jammers and decoy launchers. Of the three ships hit by Exocets, two-the Sheffield and the Birmingham-did not use their jammers or decoys, and the third, the merchant ship Atlantic Conveyer, did not have any to use. Incidentally, the Atlantic Conveyer was very unlucky. It was on the far side of the force. An Exocet missile, I understand, was neatly decoyed through the force but hit the Atlantic Conveyer on the far side because she had no decoys of her own. But, in general, how well these jammers and decoys worked on the Exocets would require detailed analysis. I hope that this information, too, is available to our Navy.
      </para>
      <para>
       One thing that comes out of this type of defence-particularly the sinking of the Atlantic Conveyer by accident, on the far side of a task force which has successfully defended itself against the missiles-is the importance of very tight and effective command and control. It requires a ship of the Invincible type to exercise that type of control of the various ship's gun systems, missile decoys and intercept sets.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, if all else fails, the ships can attempt to shoot down the missiles with close range guns or missiles which, to be effective, have to be automated. The British were poorly equipped in this area. They had only two destroyers with close range anti-missile missile systems, and these two were tagging the two carriers, the Hermes and the Invincible, providing them with some anti-missile defence which they did not have. This was a clear weakness in the force. As I said at the outset, it was seriously underequipped to deal with this threat. The British Navy has been designed to operate in the North Atlantic in a NATO environment, and it assumes in various ways that the necessary equipment will be provided by others. Its limitation was revealed when it had to work on its own.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our Navy, too, might have to work on its own. How well would we cope in circumstances such as those of the Falklands? We have no airborne early warning capability. This is an urgent need. The suggestion that this should be provided by shore based aircraft is a dangerous delusion. The airborne early warning component of the task force must be integral with the force. With the way things are going, it will have to be helicopter-borne. After the Falklands crisis, the British have now developed-I think it must be only a lash-up job-airborne early warning equipment to go in one of their Sea King helicopters. This is a line of development that we must encourage and acquire for our own forces. One of these airborne early warning helicopters is now operating in the South Atlantic on the Illustrious. I am sure that after their experience the British will be giving high priority to such a development. They fell into the trap-and they have learnt a hell of a lesson from it-of thinking that shore based aircraft would provide this. That is a trap into which wise naval forces never fall.
      </para>
      <para>
       In looking at our capabilities I wish to point out that without an aircraft carrier we have no fighter defence. That is a crucial weakness. Again, one cannot effectively defend a naval task force at sea with shore based aircraft. It has never been effectively done. It does not work. What happens is that they have other priorities, or one is at sea in fine weather and their airfields are fog-bound, as happened in the recent exercise operating out of Williamtown in Australia. If air power is integral to the survival of the task force, it must be there; it cannot be based somewhere else, because it will not be there when one needs it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The third weakness of our force is not strictly a weakness. We have the necessary electronic equipment, intercept sets, jammers and decoy launchers, but obviously we shall have to re-evaluate them in the light of the practical experience that has been learnt from comparable equipment. At present we lack any ship capable of providing co-ordination and control for the defence of a task force against missile attack. That is the role of a fully equipped ship, such as the Invincible. The Melbourne could partially do it; but we need a command and control ship to co-ordinate this type of defence. Without that, the fleet is a collection of individual ships.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to the last ditch defence, the decision to fit the Phalanx in our four FFGs, our new frigates, is very welcome. But ships such as our three DDGs will remain very vulnerable. We should look very closely at fitting the lightweight Sea Wolf anti-missile system which the British deployed in the Falklands.
      </para>
      <para>
       The whole campaign emphasised the flexibility and value of the aircraft carriers, which can carry up to a battalion of troops each, with helicopters for troop carrying, anti-submarine work and as Exocet decoys, and fixed wing aircraft for fighter defence, reconnaissance, surface strikes and ground force support. It is interesting that in the latter stages of the campaign some of the Royal Air Force Harriers operating from the carriers were based ashore on an extemporised air strip and provided very close and immediate support for the Army. That is the sort of support which they alone can provide.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, there is a limit to what two small aircraft carriers can provide with negligible shore based support. In particular, the 20 Sea Harriers were ludicrously overworked. What they were trying to provide was fighter defence, ground force support, reconnaissance-there were no AEW aircraft-and surface strike. There is no way 20 aircraft could possibly have done that. Nevertheless, they performed very well. One of the more glaring weaknesses of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the new aircraft carrier for the Australian Defence Force was its absurd assessment of the capability of the Harrier. I am glad that my colleague Senator Collard dealt with that. I shall not deal with it again. The Committee's ignorance was profound. As I said at the time, I thought that it was an inappropriate reference to give to such a body. I think that careful reading of the report would thoroughly justify that remark. The Committee's strategic assessment was very old fashioned. It was rather like the strategic assessment of King Ethelred the Unready. Its knowledge of the equipments concerned was derisory. I do not think any great notice should be taken of its report.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nevertheless it has made remarks about the capability of the Harrier which, as I said, Senator Collard has dealt with. The Harriers did perform well. They had a 30:0 success rate against the Argentine aircraft, including a high proportion of Mirages. I do not think one should get too carried away with the Harriers' air superiority role. They were operating essentially at low level. The heavy missile defence of a modern fleet makes a high level attack by aircraft very unattractive. They tend to come in low and at low levels the capabilities of the Harrier are very relevant and very competitive with aircraft such as the Mirage, particularly when the Mirages are, as they were on this occasion, operating at long range. The reason I said one should not get too carried away is that the Harriers had a markedly superior missile capability. They were using modern sidewinders. The Argentinian Mirages were using old-fashioned French Matra missiles, semi-active homing, which the Sea Harriers had little difficulty in avoiding. Nevertheless even if the Argentinian Mirages had had comparable missiles I think the Sea Harriers would have out-performed the Mirages because of their manoeuvreability and their smaller infra-red signature. Their ability to master infra-red signature would have made them very formidable opponents for the Mirages.

        —Yes, I think it is. It is very hard to judge without an analysis. I do not know whether the Argentinians would yet be prepared to co-operate in such an analysis to compare efficiency. I think one can say that of the three Argentinian services, the Air Force came out much the best. It attacked with very great courage and a fair degree of competence. What it was like in air-to- air combat I really cannot assess. That would require a lot of analysis. It is rather difficult to assess because of the marked inferiority of the British missiles, but there were some remarkable performances by British pilots in that campaign.

      <para>
       An interesting point was made that both the Royal Naval and the RAF Harriers operated from the two carriers, the HMS Hermes and the HMS Invincible. I am told that the pilots much preferred the Hermes because it was designed as a carrier and had a very much larger flight deck. I think everyone knows that the Invincible was not really designed as an aircraft carrier and the pilots found the flight deck rather restrictive. But the fact that the RAF pilots-many of them without previous carrier experience-could operate in such weather from a carrier shows the incredible capability of the Harrier. In fact a number of RAF Harriers flew from England, refuelling on the way with one stop at the Ascension Islands and then made their first ever deck landing at sea off the Falklands. That is a capability we would never have contemplated with any other aircraft but the Harrier. The flexibility the Harrier provides, the ability to operate afloat or ashore, raises the question whether when we get the Harrier types-as I am sure we will-they should not all be manned by the Air Force.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reconnaissance by the RAF Nimrods operating from the Ascension Islands, 4, 000 miles away, was obviously inadequate, as evidenced by a large merchant ship reaching Port Stanley undetected in the very late stages of the campaign. There are no real lessons here for us for I am sure we would never contemplate such an operation, 4,000 miles from our nearest base. Nevertheless, one can easily imagine circumstances under which we might conduct operations at a substantial distance from our nearest base and to ensure that our forces are never left without land-based air support we have an obvious need for an in-flight refuelling capability. That is why the announcement by the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) that we are to acquire two 707s to provide us with this capability is so welcome. I hope that when we get them they will be compatible with those of our American allies. One of the peculiar features of the Falklands campaign was the fact that British aircraft could not refuel from American tankers, despite their being North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Before I leave the aircraft carrier question I make two further points. The first is that much has been made of the use of container ships such as the Atlantic Conveyor as parking lots for extra Harriers. I think the total force at one stage was as high as 35-twenty in the two aircraft carriers and 15 more in the parking lots. This is obviously a good way of deploying more Harriers than could possibly be physically fitted in the two aircraft carriers. But these container ships were not actually operating the Harriers. To do that they would have needed servicing facilities, fuel, ammunition and appropriate radar and radio. To put all this into a ship would result in a valuable unit which would justify internal protection and defensive armament, and before long one would have gained an aircraft carrier. A container ship can be a useful supplement to an aircraft carrier but the aircraft carrier itself is still needed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other point I want to make about aircraft carriers is their high survivability. For some reason the totally false impression has been created that aircraft carriers are particularly vulnerable. The facts disprove this. Before the Second World War it was an article of faith among shore-based air power advocates that no aircraft carrier could possibly survive within range of a shore-based bombing attack. Yet in six years of World War II more than 200 aircraft carriers were operated by both sides and the number sunk by shore-based air attack was one. Of course during that use the aircraft carriers were taking on and subduing shore-based air forces and the number sunk by shore-based air attack was one. Since World War II aircraft carriers have provided the major part of the tactical air support in successive campaigns, such as Korea, Suez, Vietnam and now the Falklands, and no aircraft carrier has been sunk or even damaged. No ship is unsinkable, but aircraft carriers do have a remarkable capacity to survive.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some other points must be made briefly. The British nuclear powered submarines completely cowed the Argentine navy, particularly after the sinking of the General Belgrano. After that, as far as one can gather, the Argentine Navy remained in its territorial waters. The Argentine submarines-two new German- built ones and two old American-built ones-one of which was sunk, achieved nothing. They did force on the British considerable measures of precautionary defence against them but I have not been able to find out whether they actually tried to attack. Attacking in those sorts of conditions with heavy, deep swell requires a degree of submarine training which I doubt they had.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another point is that the neutralising of the airfield at Port Stanley proved a difficult task. In three strikes by Vulcan heavy bombers a total of one crater was made in the runway; and C130 Hercules aircraft used the runway till the very end. Quite apart from the obvious political difficulties of attacking the mainland Argentine airfields, it may be that the reason they did not do so was that they could not guarantee that their attacks would be effective. The Harriers could not contribute much to to this for two reasons. One is that they had no self-penetrating bombs with which to crater runways. If a 1,000 pound bomb were dropped from a very low altitude it would make a very small crater. Secondly, the Argentine air defences at Port Stanley were much heavier than the British had been led to expect and the Harriers had to attack from very low level. As I said, the Harriers finished up operating ashore from extemporised runways.
      </para>
      <para>
       Perhaps the most decisive advantage the British troops had over the Argentine Army was in night fighting. This was partly a matter of training and partly a matter of equipment, particularly infra-red equipment. I am sure there will be some equipment and training lessons for our Army when the Falklands lessons are fully analysed. I do not want to make much of this because there has been a great deal of experience of these aspects in the various Middle East wars.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, there is the matter of the loss of so many Royal Navy ships through fire. I must say I was not surprised. For years it has been making its ships more and more like tinder-boxes. It is not a question of the aluminium superstructure. Aluminium does not burn; it does melt at about 800* Fahrenheit as opposed to 1500* Fahrenheit for steel. But it is certainly inconvenient to have the superstructure melting around the crew. For the superstructure to melt there must be a fire underneath it. That should be what one aims to prevent. Incidentally, the most spectacular loss through fire, HMS Sheffield, was a type 42 destroyer with a steel, not aluminium, superstructure. Again, the Exocet missile did not even go off. The Sheffield was lost through the fire caused by the unburnt propellant in the missile. The Royal Navy has never been very good at fire precautions. Even during World War II many ships were lost unnecessarily through fire. I well remember my shock when I joined the cruiser HMAS Australia in the Pacific in the Second World War. At that stage I had seen only British fire precautions. I was shattered when I went on board that ship. She had been stripped. There was nothing that would burn. She was later hit by six suicide aircraft which is roughly the effective power of an Exocet. She did not burn. There was nothing to burn. We, perhaps, had been converted with the power of the new converts, but at least it was an example of what could be done.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since World Was II, the Royal Navy's fire precautions have deteriorated still further. I regret to say that our Navy has followed suit with the British designed ships. They have wooden furniture, carpets, curtains, linoleum, plastic panels, plastic covers and so on. They have inflammable bedding. Our United States-built ships are markedly superior in fire precautions. The Navy must urgently bring all our ships up to the standard of our United States-built ones and see whether we should go further. We must have ships that are not fire traps . Honourable senators may notice that I have not mentioned the British Government welshing on the sale of HMS Invincible. This will probably cost us about $500m. Although the Invincible performed excellently in the Falklands, there was nothing in her performance that was not clearly predictable and known to the British Government before it agreed to the sale. Nothing was changed by the campaign. The reason I will not say anything about the British Government's behaviour is that anything I did say would be unprintable.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final thing we must learn from the Falklands is the unpredictable nature of wars. Britain was surprised by the trouble in the Falklands. We cannot be sure that we will not be similarly surprised. We must be certain that our Defence Force is prepared and capable of reacting appropriately.

        —I take the opportunity presented by the debate on the second reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83 to make some references to the quality of administration in the Attorney-General's Department as revealed by the Estimates Committee hearings and some more recent events. In case anyone in the Senate fears that this is an opportunity that I will take on numerous further occasions when we get to the Committee stage of this Bill and the consideration of the Attorney-General's Department in particular I make the point that I will not be available for that Committee stage debate and am taking the present opportunity to do what I would otherwise do then. It is perhaps a little unsporting of me to pursue the question of the Attorney-General's Department's performance in the continued absence, through illness, of the Attorney-General, Senator Durack. But the scale and magnitude of the maladministration, the delay, the neglect, the incompetence and the lethargy demonstrated by that Department and made evident particularly during the recent round of Estimates Committee hearings demands that these questions be aired once again, although I will not take the time of the Senate to do so at the length which might be thought appropriate if justice were really to be done.

      <para>
       The Estimates Committee hearings revealed, of course, a lot of the detail to which Mr Costigan had made fairly broad reference in his report about the performance of the Attorney-General's Department in relation to the pursuit of bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoiders and the enactment of remedial legislation in that area. A number of points were confirmed by those hearings. First, no coherent or thought out advice was given to the Australian Taxation Office at any stage-certainly not in the crucial period of 1977 to 1978-as to the availability of the existing law to deal with these measures or as to the kind of litigation strategy which might be advanced to stop this sort of activity stone dead. No such coherent or thought out advice was given, despite numerous requests for such advice and for action received by the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department from the Australian Taxation Office. When that advice was finally forthcoming, firstly in oral form in 1978 and subsequently in written form in 1979, it has become quite clear from the evidence that has been made available to the Senate and otherwise put on the public record that there was no clear, detailed, thorough or careful analysis at any stage of the law upon which that advice was given. That state of affairs will, I suggest, become even more clearly revealed when the Government finally produces, as it must, the further documents in this matter which have been the subject of a resolution from the Senate and which are presently awaiting the finalisation of some appropriate filtering procedure to enable the substance of those documents to be revealed without, at the same time, doing anything which could put at risk prosecutions in this area. I say no more about that because, undoubtedly, that will be the subject of further debate in the Senate.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further matter that has become evident from the Estimates Committee hearings is that there was no appreciation by senior officers within the Attorney-General 's Department at any stage of the extraordinarily important test case character of the proposed action in Perth against the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme that was, in fact, discovered very early in the course of events by the Taxation Office and in respect of which an early decision was taken in 1975 to pursue a prosecution. The Estimates Committee hearing revealed a dogged insistence on the part of senior officers of the Attorney-General's Department, right up to the top to Mr Neaves, the Secretary, that that kind of litigation taken at that time would not have been so significant and might even have been counter-productive. There was an utter failure to acknowledge the utility of the deterrent effect of effective, swift action demonstrating a government will to act at the appropriate time.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further thing about the conduct of the Attorney-General's Department in relation to this extraordinarily important tax avoidance and evasion matter was the revelation that, again, has emerged over the last few weeks, that the Attorney-General's Department spent nearly three years between 1978 and 1980 fooling around aimlessly in drafting what eventually became the 1980 Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act. It fooled around in the sense that no serious consideration appears to have been given by anybody at any stage to the necessity for that legislation and the precise condition of the existing law and the inadequacies of that law making such legislation necessary. Apparently, some consideration was given, we were told during the Estimates Committee hearings, to the adequacy of existing law at a meeting between Senator Durack, Mr O' Donovan and Mr Neaves at some point during this period. But no one is able to tell us what precisely the date of that meeting was, and what precisely was discussed. So one is unable to have much confidence about the quality of the thoughtfulness that went into this aspect of the Attorney-General's Department's administration.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, of course, in relation to this whole unhappy saga, it has been revealed in recent weeks in the course of this debate that there has been no proper or effective supervision at a central level of the performance of the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department. The bizarre, festering mess of the Perth Office of the DCS is simply the most obvious manifestation of that lack of supervision. It is one thing, one might think, to have a relatively relaxed work environment in the Attorney-General's Department as anywhere else. It seems to me to be quite another thing to have someone with a responsibility for running taxation prosecutions running on the side a little agency in company matters for Brian Maher, the nation's most notorious tax avoidance and evasion promoter, and, just for good measure, a squalid little escort agency involving most of the female members, it seems, of the family of the officer concerned. The behaviour of the officer in question at the Perth DCS office, which was revealed in the Costigan report, has become something of a national joke. But it is a joke which leaves a rather sour taste in one's mouth when one contemplates the significance of this behaviour in terms of the quality of government administration in a crucially important area. What was revealed, moreover-I keep coming back to the Estimates Committee hearings into this matter -is that notwithstanding the manifest inadequacy of the performance of the Crown Solicitor's Division and the State Deputy Crown Solicitor's officers, an inadequacy that had at least been recognised by the Department to the extent of setting in train a joint management review some little time ago, nonetheless, there was still an extraordinary failure of expedition by the Department in implementing the sound and sensible recommendations of that joint management review. We had revealed to us, again in the Estimates Committee hearings, that a program of implementation, intended to last some two years, a time table that was accepted by the senior officers of the Department as sensible and appropriate, has already stretched out to something like four years, with no end in sight as to when that particular series of administrative changes will be accomplished.
      </para>
      <para>
       No doubt, as was made clear both in the joint management review and in other people's evidence, a good deal of the problem so far as the maladministration in the Crown Solicitor's Division is concerned has had traditionally to do with the extraordinarily heavy work load that has been borne by the Crown Solicitor himself. I would not wish to sound utterly unsympathetic to the individuals concerned who have occupied those positions because I know well just how debilitating an effect that kind of work load must have had on their capacity simultaneously to administer a very complex and extensive administration operation. But the point remains that there have been spectacular failures of administration by successive Crown solicitors-perhaps for good reason-and they have been failures of administration brought about by the utter inability of those with decision making power to appreciate the necessity for a much more expanded administrative apparatus in this area and the utilisation or the application of many more resources to make the system work. Of course there are competent and dedicated officers at all levels still working within the Attorney -General's Department. But there has been, in recent years, and certainly in recent months, a total collapse of morale in that Department. The revelations to which I have referred are not the cause of that collapse of morale but simply a symptom of what has been a very long-standing decay.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the Estimates Committee hearings were completed further revelations still have come tumbling out about the quality of administration in this law enforcement area within the Attorney-General's Department. The Crown Solicitor's Division clearly continues to be something of a tumultuous area with there now being three Deputy Crown Solicitor's positions more or less simultaneously being advertised in the nation's Press, one of them becoming vacant in Perth as a result of the disciplinary action against Mr Massey, another one becoming vacant in Sydney through the departure, in somewhat exceptional circumstances, it appears, of the head of the Sydney office, and now, it seems, we have the impending retirement of the head of the Melbourne office, creating yet another vacancy.
      </para>
      <para>
       While all this has been happening we have had the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, in its medifraud inquiry, drawing out, bit by bit-it will be fascinating to see the final report-the long history of incompetence and maladministration, again by the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department, in pursuit of medifraud prosecutions, a failure of action by the Department of Health and the Attorney-General's Department between them which seems to have cost the nation something like $100m a year. Then we have had the quite justified criticism continuing to be levied against the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department in relation to its total lack of performance so far as trade practices prosecutions are concerned. I have made reference to this in the Parliament before and I simply now refer to the long article in the Australian Financial Review by Paul Malone on 1 November 1982 which documents the long and abominable series of demonstrations of incapacity by the various Deputy Crown Solicitor's Offices in those trade practices prosecution areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       What has been the response of the Acting Attorney-General and the Attorney- General's Department to all of this? On the one hand we have had a series of disciplinary forays being mounted, confined, however, to just three officers in the Perth Crown Solicitor's Office against whom two sets of charges have so far been determined, with adverse findings being made, and with one other set of charges, I understand, still outstanding. The point to be made about that, of course, is that for all the utility of such charges-I do not in any way seek to understate the desirability of maladministration being dealt with in this way- these are still essentially the low men on the totem pole within the Attorney- General's Department. It is very obvious that no action has been taken against the rather more senior members of that department, extending all the way up to the top, whose negligence and administrative ineffectiveness can be argued to have been at least as damaging as anything that was accomplished by the Masseys, the Bercoves and the O'Sullivans of this world.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second response is a rather fascinating one, as it appears. That has been the flurry of activity by the Government and the Department in recent weeks designed to bring about, as it appears from Press reports, an ultimate split in the Attorney-General's Department so that it will operate in the future not just as the Attorney-General's Department but as a Department of Justice as well. It seems that the proposed Department of Justice would contain the Justice Division of the Attorney-General's Department, that is, the policy division, the Deputy Crown Solicitor's division, the proposed National Crimes Commission and the recently established office of the Special Prosecutor, leaving the Attorney- General's Department to deal with all the rest of the policy areas which are presently within its jurisdiction.
      </para>
      <para>
       I find it rather fascinating to see the way in which there has been a scurrying by the Minister and the senior departmental officials off to the bottom drawer to dust off, for further contemporary scrutiny, a proposal that has been around, in one form or another, for decades. The motivation for this particular exercise is pretty obvious. It is to divert attention from what has been demonstrated to be spectacular incompetence in the administration of the Attorney-General's Department, to pretend that the reason for it is some fundamental structural problem and to pretend that that structural problem can be solved simply by cloning the Attorney-General's Department, producing out of the one department two more or less identical bodies doing the same sort of thing as the Attorney- General's Department always has done but doing it through the agency of two separate departments rather than one.
      </para>
      <para>
       It may be that there is a need for some structural changes in this area. I indeed have floated one of them-the idea that the Crown Solicitor's Division be replaced by a semi-independent director of public prosecutions on the United Kingdom basis. But I certainly, and the Opposition, I believe, would need a lot of convincing before we believed that this particular exercise has any other rational justification than a cosmetic one. I would need a great deal of persuading that the proposed Department of Justice, with the proposed division of functions, is anything more than an attempt to divert attention from what has been a failure by a number of individuals, starting with the Minister, of course , but extending down through the senior levels of the Department, to perform up to scratch. It is failure that has had very debilitating and unhappy consequences for the nation as a whole and it is a failure that I doubt can be corrected by other than fairly drastic replacement of the individuals concerned. Simple reorganisation of the kind that is proposed is unlikely to make very much difference.
      </para>
      <para>
       The remaining things I want to say are directed to the law reform area in which the Attorney-General and his Department have indeed built up a lamentable record over the last few years. This is something which I have had constant cause to attack. I do not repeat on this occasion the things that I have said on innumerable others, not least during discussion of a matter of public importance on 8 September 1982. At that time I drew attention to and fully documented something like 32 instances of serious delay or maladministration-a good many of those involving utter failure or unwillingness to act in key law reform areas. But I make the point-I think this is the occasion when it is appropriate to make it-that that failure continues on the part of the Attorney-General's Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       At Question Time today I raised a question with Senator Chaney about the failure of the Government to implement the concept of an Australian sentencing council, the central recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 636-page report on the sentencing of Federal offenders that it brought down in January 1980. Senator Chaney's answer, in which he justified the Government's failure to act by reference to a rather glib remark that most criminals in this country are prosecuted under State rather than Federal law, demonstrates either a profound ignorance or a profound indifference, or both, to the fact that the Law Reform Commission had in fact devoted an enormous amount of its resources over a long period in dealing with just that question of Federal offenders, and sentencing law and practice in relation to them. The cavalier dismissal of these sorts of initiatives and this sort of work, based as it is on public hearings and the gathering of a great deal of evidence, does not say much for the Government's sensitivity in the law reform area.
      </para>
      <para>
       The particular law reform issue to which I want to draw attention finally in my remarks goes to the question of family law, where the performance of this Government has been nothing short of disgraceful. After long consideration by parliamentary committees and other bodies we had the introduction, now over a year ago, of a Family Law Amendment Bill, not designed to do anything terribly drastic so far as reshaping family law in this country but certainly designed to work a number of improvements in the way in which that law was actually operating. The situation is that, although that Bill has been sitting around for over a year now, and although the Senate will be sitting another three weeks and the House of Representatives will be sitting another two weeks in toto, I understand that that Bill will not be brought on this year. The result is that literally thousands of people who are being inconvenienced or whose rights are being put at risk by the failure of the present Act to be effective procedurally and in other ways-people who are suffering as a result of the failure of this legislation to get parliamentary air time-will go on suffering, it seems, until at least the middle of next year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Wives whose husbands receive superannuation benefits some time after the divorce is complete but who receive no share whatsoever in that benefit will go on being disadvantaged by the failure of this legislation to come to pass. Questions about the custody of adopted children will still be determined in the rather inadequately equipped Supreme Court, jurisdiction in these matters being denied to the Family Court. The situation will continue where the Family Court is not able or obliged to take into account in custody matters the wishes of children under 14 years of age-another reform proposed to be accomplished by this legislation. Matrimonial property orders will not be able to be varied where financial circumstances have changed significantly, even where the parties agree and where the welfare of the child requires it, because the provisions of the Act at the moment are inflexible in this respect. Persons other than the parents of a child will go on being prevented from bringing proceedings for custody or guardianship even where the welfare of the child requires it because of the failure of the existing law to be changed in simple ways by this essentially simple piece of legislation. There is no conception of urgency. There is no willingness to deal with these problems. There is endless buck passing and endless throwing away of the sense of urgency that is needed to get these changes into law.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have one remaining point which goes to matrimonial property questions which have been very much left in the air, left in abeyance, as a result again of the negligence, the maladministration and the failure of this Government to act. There has been a long-standing concern-it is evidenced partially by the superannuation question contained in this Bill-about the inadequacy of existing matrimonial property law to reflect accurately, fairly and equitably the different interest of parties to a marriage. I simply put on the record this matter because I am profoundly disturbed by it. In October 1981 the Attorney- General announced that a committee of inquiry would be appointed to examine matrimonial property law. I have now been informed that the projected starting date of January 1983, already deplorably belated as that date obviously is, is almost certain to be deferred again. The reason for that further delay is the breakdown on negotiations-negotiations which have already gone on for an unbelievable 15 months-for the appointment of a particular gentleman, Professor David Hambly, to head that committee of inquiry. What has happened is that Professor Hambly, who is regarded as one of the nation's experts on family law and family property law in particular, has resigned the deanship in the faculty of law at the Australian National University in anticipation of this appointment -anticipation that he was reasonably entitled to have. He has been inconvenienced in a series of other ways by virtue of rearranging his affairs in order to ready himself to take on this extremely important job. Through the intervention of the Acting Attorney-General, Mr Brown, there was a hasty and abortive attempt to appoint someone other than Professor Hambly. It now appears that Mr Brown has withdrawn from the fray and left it to Senator Durack to sort out the matter. Of course Senator Durrack's reputation for speed in these matters is quite legendary.
      </para>
      <para>
       I simply make the point that there has been an endless amount of maladministration, of failure to implement through simple administrative decisions-not even serious policy decisions-important reform initiatives which are of real relevance to an enormous number of people in this country. Just as with the matrimonial property law inquiry, just as with the amendments to the Family Law Act, just as with the sentencing council matter, just as with some two dozen other failure of law reform initiatives to which I have referred on previous occasions, the Attorney-General's Department once again has demonstrated itself to be wholly incompetent at doing the job that it has so long been established to do. It is a great pity that so much criticism has had to be directed against the Attorney-General's Department in recent months but I suggest it is an even greater pity that that criticism, extensive and intensive as it has been, so far seems to have failed to bring about any discernible reaction or any discernible improvement on the part of this Government.

        —We are debating the second reading of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83, which Bill appropriates a sum of nearly $12 billion. That is a very large sum of money-larger than it was last year. My concern is at the very high cost of government today. It is important to realise that government does not generate money in any way. The powerhouse that generates it is the private sector, and the cost of government in Australia today is astronomical. This is far more than an academic point. This country has to survive in a very competitive international commercial world. Quite simply, we cannot be in business in the 1990s with the techniques that we use at present . Our problems come from three broad sections: Our industrial relations are bad, our tariff policies are bad, and our management practices are bad.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Very briefly, with trade union relations we cannot tolerate a monopoly of the supply of labour from which we suffer to a degree that no other country does. We have done everything we can, through the Trade Practices Commission, the monopolies commission and all those sorts of things to control the monopoly of capital. People cannot abuse the possession of capital. They certainly cannot use a monopoly position to the detriment of society. Yet we all live under the intolerable imposition of a monopoly of labour coming through the trade union movement. What we have to do to reform the industrial relations situation in this country is to create a market in labour the way that we create a market in capital. That means the abolition of compulsory unionism. It means the abolition of some of the underpinnings for it in the form of minimal wages and such things . The only way to get young people employed is to make the employment of those young people commercially attractive.
      </para>
      <para>
       The tariff problem is as large as the union relations problem. In brief, what is happening with the excessive levels of tariffs in Australia is that we drive scarce capital resources and other scarce resources into fields that are not productive from a point of view of international competition. It is rather sad that now we are in a very difficult economic time people are saying, 'Let's have higher tariff barriers, let's have higher quotas.' That will not help us one little bit. It might put off dying today until tomorrow but surely as God made little apples we will die tomorrow if we do not reform our inaccurate and inappropriate tariff policies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The third aspect is that of management. In Australian private industry management there is much that is bad, but I want to talk today about what is bad with respect to government management. Government in Australia is now big business. It is huge business. As I have said, the cost of that government must be met by private industry. Some 35 per cent of gross domestic product is spent by the Federal Government. That is a huge increase compared with the proportion taken historically, just 10 or 20 years ago, by the Federal Government. I do not have a figure as to total government expenditure in Australia but I imagine it amounts to 38 to 40 per cent of GDP. All that money has to be raised in the form of taxes and levies. Not only has that money to be taken out of the community, but we must look also at the cost of the administration that the Government imposes on the community and the efficiency or the inefficiency with which that administration is carried out.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have all seen the size of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is several inches thick. It has reached the stage where it is beyond reasonable comprehension. If there is one thing this country needs it is to throw out the Income Tax Assessment Act and bring in a simpler form of taxation. I have never seen a figure given by the Treasury Department of what it costs to administer the income tax legislation, but I could believe it would be well over 50 per cent of revenue. It must be a huge expenditure. Just the other day I saw that another large number of assessors was being put on. We just keep on going down the path of patching up an unworkable system, absolutely blind to the quite artificial distortions being created in the economy. We are perverting the goals that we are trying to attain absolutely blind to the huge cost of operating a totally inefficient and unworkable system. Quite simply, we cannot in the commercial world go into the 1990s with the techniques we have at present.
      </para>
      <para>
       The power that big government exercises through its Public Service in the business field particularly, is enormous. The intelligence, integrity and ability of the Public Service is not in dispute here. The point is that we are asking public servants in so many departments to operate in a commercial field, to exercise a commercial judgment which they simply do not have. Their training is not in that field. We also do not have a system of reward and censure applying to public servants who operate in commercial fields. That is absolutely essential. People must be rewarded when they do well and censured when they make mistakes. It is very hard to see how that can be introduced in the Public Service. Of course, the short answer is that it should not be doing that. Such operations should be left to private industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another matter in regard to the growth of government is of concern to anyone who is interested in democracy in this country. I refer to the sheer size of the Public Service itself. We had a very good example of this a couple of weeks ago when one of the spokesmen for the Public Service in South Australia blatantly campaigned for the Labor Government in the election campaign that was proceeding there. We have reached an intolerable situation, if employees can campaign and use their large numbers against the government of the day. I think that when the more intelligent members of even the Labor Party reflect on that they will become a little uneasy about its possible long term effects.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to instance two or three aspects of the Appropriation Bill in respect of which I believe that waste or lack of control is occurring. The first relates to the estimates for the Department of Aviation. It is just a small point which concerns the Independent Air Fares Committee. That Committee was set up as a consequence of the Airlines Agreement Bill that was approved by the Parliament in March of last year. Basically it was set up to look at how fares were structured in Australia and to come up with a fairer formula. That is a perfectly laudable goal. I forget how many people are on the Committee-it may be four or five-but one would not have thought that its deliberations would occupy more than half a day a month, or a day a month; that they could be conducted at moderate cost. But one finds that the estimates for the Department of Aviation this year provide for an expenditure of $495,000-for four or five people to set the air fares for the Australian travelling public. That is manifestly absurd. We are paying to these people $283,000 in salaries and allowances, and are supporting them at an administrative cost of $212,000. That is absolutely indefensible. It represents an expenditure of $500,000, which one can guarantee in the Estimates for next year will have increased by 25 or 40 per cent-just to set fares. Maybe the setting of fares could be left to the private sector and the market place.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second department to which I want to refer is the Department of Defence. I do not wish to take as long as did Senator Hamer. I have really been provoked into this by some of the interesting points that he raised. One of the points I would like to make is that the Government has called for a new strategic assessment which will be due in the new year, certainly within the first six months of 1982. The strategic assessment is a confidential document but it is one which identifies the threats to Australia. On it is based the whole of Australia's defence strategy, equipment, Force structure and so on. Everything flows from the strategic assessment. I do not know how often strategic assessments are made. I have never seen one and do not expect to because it is quite a confidential document, but I presume it is made every five or 10 years. In the light of this absolutely crucial assessment being made, it is wrong for the Cabinet to be calling for a decision by 30 November on a major piece of equipment, such as whether or not we need a carrier, and for the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) to be saying that a decision will be made by 30 December. Whatever that decision might be it is irrelevant. The point is that until an assessment of needs is made it is absolutely wrong to be committing oneself one way or the other. The assessment will be made in the new year, presumably a month or two after the Cabinet decides on the carrier.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Hamer had quite a bit to say about the carrier. I would like to take a broader view, first of all, and just look at the situation with respect to the Royal Australian Navy because there is an increasingly vocal concern about Navy purchases over the last 10 years or so. Most have been very unhappy events. There is considerable disquiet about the suitability of the FFG design from a functional point of view. It was designed to meet the low threat case. The high threat case was the Spruance design for the United States Navy. Where the FFGs fit into the Australian fleet structure is rather hard to determine because, from a fighting point of view, they are not terribly well able to look after themselves unaided. Also, there has been a lot of criticism about both the single screw design and quality control generally. The need for a $500,000 repair to Canberra which has become evident in the last couple of weeks highlights what I am talking about.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another area of concern about the Navy is the provision of helicopters, which are absolutely vital for the FFGs. They were a design requirement, yet the Royal Australian Navy has messed around for years calling tenders for the supply of helicopters that did not exist. The helicopters simply could not be designed because of the lack of the technology that the Navy wanted in them. Fortunately, in the last six months the penny has dropped and the Navy is now assessing what the state of the art is in the world and is proceeding, somewhat belatedly, to write specifications for helicopters that actually can be built and can be bought.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another area of concern is the Fremantle class ship. I will neglect the mess-up about the main armament on that ship. Tenders were called for the construction of the ship on the basis that detailed design drawings would be available. A contractor was appointed and then it was found that there were no detailed design drawings. That has occasioned the contractor a very considerable cost which has run into millions of dollars. That was a bad administrative mistake on the part of the Navy. We have had problems with HMAS Cook. No one knows how long it will take for Cook to be finished. The ship overran both its contract price and its contract time by a very large margin. The ship received notoriety because the Navy wanted to add extra equipment to it and a big hole was cut in its side later on. My advice is that it is back at the Williamstown Dockyard with major problems with its propulsion and no one knows when it will go into service.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fleet replenishment ship that is being built at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard poses another problem. I can well remember the Minister giving us cast- iron assurances that the ship would be built at tender price and on time. We are well past the time when the ship should have been finished. No one knows when it will be finished or what it will cost. A large part of that is due to the Navy itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is true that the contractor, Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd, was very keen to get that contract and bent over backwards to get it. The company may have overcommitted itself, but well over 200 design changes have been requested by the Navy at very short notice which have added enormously to the cost and to the delay of the ship. I am told that one of the most recent changes is a requirement that the forklift trucks for moving stores be doubled in weight and carrying capacity which means that the deck plates have to be doubled up and the deck beams have to be doubled up underneath them. The builder has given up in despair; he does not know where to go. About the only thing the Navy has done well recently from a purchasing point of view concerns the submarine program and the submarine weapons update, which technically, functionally, and in every operational way, has been a brilliantly successful venture and a venture which has been of great value to Australia's deterrent capacity.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not wish to spend much time going down the path that Senator Hamer went down, but I wish to comment on a few of the comments he made because there are other points of view on this matter. One of the great lessons of the Falkland Islands war was that the traditional and time honoured Navy technique of operating a blockade was successful and worked well. The British submarines blockaded, or were thought by the Argentinians to have blockaded, the harbour. This bottled up the Argentine Navy and thereby kept the British supply lines, which were very long and very vulnerable, secure. The war also showed the vulnerability of big ships despite whatever defences they might have in today's missile age.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Hamer rightly drew attention to the fact that airborne early warning radar-to be able to do over the horizon targeting-is absolutely essential. He went on to make the case that shore-based airborne early warning is never any good at all. That position really has to be qualified. Airborne early warning aircraft, such as the E-2Cs, can be both shore-based and carrier-based, but a carrier very much bigger than the type of ship that is contemplated for the Australian Navy would be needed. To suggest that a helicopter airborne early warning system is an adequate system is to state the case only partly. It is better than nothing at all but it is not much use and it will probably be out- performed by any strike aircraft operating against it. There are major limitations with respect to range, time on station and the altitude to which helicopters can climb. This is quite apart from the mechanical unreliability and the associated problems they have. Unless a navy has an airborne early warning system it is in grave difficulties when operating on the surface with ships today against any attacking force.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Hamer made the point that with fighter defence at sea there has to be a naval task force. I would agree with that, if the ships are there. The larger question is: Why are the ships there? Will Australia need ships in that position ? Given our responsibilities that is an arguable point. To provide both an AEW capacity and adequate fighter defence, one has to have a conventional carrier. These toys, such as the Invincible and the Iwo Jima class vessels, will not provide the resources that we need. They simply do not have the capability. Senator Hamer made a very valid point regarding the command and control function for the support of the fleet, but it is incorrect to assume that that function can be provided only by a carrier. It can be provided by any command ship. Senator Hamer then went on to discourse at length about the Harriers. I will say something about those in another speech at some other time. Basically, the Harrier was a proof of concept aircraft. I saw the first aircraft fly at Farnborough at the end of the 1950s. The Harrier set out to prove that an aircraft could take off and land vertically. It was never designed as a fighter or strike aircraft, but is has been put into those roles and it has some major and fundamental shortcomings in that area. Senator Hamer is incorrect when he suggests that missile defences are so successful that all air operations at sea will be conducted at low level and, therefore, a flying brick like the Harrier is able to fight on equal terms subsoncially with any strike aircraft coming in. That is not what it is about at all. The aim of the game is not to kill other aircraft; it is to kill other ships. With the stand-off strike capabilities of weapons such as the Harpoon and so on, one has to have target acquisition and pursuit; that is, a general capability to take on those aircraft at a point quite remote from the ships, which could well be done at altitude.
      </para>
      <para>
       More than 20 Harriers were involved in the Falkland Islands dispute. On my count at least 42 were involved. Interestingly, while they had a successful kill rate against the Mirages far more Mirages or Argentinian aircraft were knocked out by surface-to-air missiles. Twenty-seven aircraft were credited to the Harriers and 40 aircraft to the surface-to-air missiles. Given the general poor state of the British surface-to-air missiles those figures tell us a lot. The success of the Harriers, as everyone concedes, came from the fact that they had the AIM-9L, the latest mark of the Sidewinder, which was a full hemisphere weapon. The Argentinians had nothing in any sense comparable with that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn to a minor point. Senator Hamer talked about the way the Royal Air Force crews could land on the ships. He attributed that to the capability of the aircraft. As an old airman, I would rather take the point that it says a great deal for the training of the RAF crews that they could land on a ship at sea when they had never done it before. Without getting into details on this, the important thing was that the Harriers could not secure the area. The Argentinians were operating at will at night. It is a hell of an indictment for an aircraft which pretends to be a fighter not to be able to deny penetration of air space in all weather. The C130 transports of the Argentinian Air Force, which are the same as the Hercules in Australia, have a radar signature from their propellers and their huge bulk like a block of flats. If one cannot find a C130 at night one had better give up the business one is in. The Harriers never ever intercepted any of the C130s. Right up until the night before the fall of Port Stanley the C130s were going in there. Senator Hamer had something to say about the loss rate of the carriers. That is a rather specious argument. Since 1945 carriers have never operated in an opposed environment. They have been operating off-shore in places such as Korea and Vietnam, but they certainly were not subject to any counter operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       I return to the point that the lesson of the Falkland Islands was basically the use of the blockade-the way the submarines blockaded the Argentinian fleet in the harbours. That is of great relevance to Australia, because anyone who invades this country will have to use sea-borne transport to get here in the end . With the submarines which we have we can mount a very effective blockade of our harbours. The second point was vulnerability of the large surface ships. In many ways the protagonists for a carrier of the HMS Invinvible type for Australia are in the same class as those generals in the First World War who failed to understand the importance of the machine gun and the way in which it would revolutionise technology on the battlefield. As a result a whole generation died. I hope we will not pay that price again.
      </para>
      <para>
       My final argument on the Falklands is that as soon as they could the British moved in the Phantom aircraft. They make no secret of the fact that had they had the Phantoms, with the Hermes in its conventional role and not, as it was, converted to short deck vessel, they would not have suffered the losses they did . They would have been able to establish air superiority and protect their ships . The fact that as soon as they got the runway repaired they put in the Phantoms speaks volumes for the relevant performance of the two types of aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final point I want to raise concerns the Department of Foreign Affairs estimate in relation to the administrative costs of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. This year the Bureau has been appropriated $8.4m for salaries and overtime. The appropriation is down roughly $1m on last year, but it is still $8.4m. The administrative costs for the Bureau amount to $1.3m, making a total of $9.7m. Australia has gone from operating one of the cheapest forms of foreign aid in the world, administratively, to getting the laurel wreath for operating one of the most expensive. That leads to the whole question of foreign aid, which runs in excess of $646.6m. These are difficult times and it is time to look critically at what a big block of money like that is doing. An amount of $646m would keep an awful lot of Australians in jobs if we expended it in the correct way.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is the argument around that Australia has an obligation to give money to other countries in the form of overseas aid. As I understand the argument, it is completely immoral because people say that if we give a country $50m or $100m, we will buy its friendship. They do not ever take the argument beyond that point . I find that quite immoral. If we are doing something of value that enables a country to raise its standard of living, that is one thing; that is an argument. It is not an argument that necessarily takes priority over Australians' standard of living. We have to look far more critically at where a lot of our foreign aid is going and maybe review downwards the aid we give. If we were to put that $ 646m towards building roads or one of the developmental programs that this country needs, we would go a very long way towards reducing unemployment in this country and giving the stimulus to business that it needs to get going.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am very concerned about the cost of government in Australia. It seems to become more expensive and more unanswerable year after year. It is exacting an enormous toll from the Australian business community. I do not believe we can go into the latter part of this decade and into the next decade with an ever- expanding government taking more and more from private business. There has to be a halt; there has to be an evaluation of what governments should be doing and how efficiently they go about their tasks.

        —In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1 ) I want mainly to deal with the events in South Australia on Saturday last and the events that led up to them. Before I get on to that topic I want to make a few remarks about what Senator MacGibbon has said. I agree with his last remarks , that one of the ways we will overcome the unemployment problem in Australia is for a government to have enough courage to spend money on public works. Unfortunately the Government of which he is a member does just the opposite-it runs down the public works program and the public works employees. It has done this not only in the federal sphere but also to a very large extent in the State of South Australia. That is one of the reasons why the previous Premier, David Tonkin, after tomorrow morning will be officially the Leader of the Opposition.

        —No doubt the party will give him the axe but he will remain the Leader of the Opposition for the time that the people who sit behind him see fit to keep him there. Every time Senator MacGibbon speaks in this place he criticises the trade union movement. He blames the trade unionists for every ill that faces this country. That is completely wrong. The trade unionists are people to be looked up to. The trade union leaders are endeavouring only to get a just share of the cake for their members and to better their members' living standards. Every time honourable senators opposite make speeches about the terrible chaos this country is in, they have to blame the trade union movement. They ought to give credit to the trade unions.

        —That makes it all the worse for Senator MacGibbon to criticise members of the trade union movement. One of his opening remarks was that he was opposed to compulsory unionism. I have never heard him complain in this Parliament about the compulsion which exists in his own dental profession. If a person had learned at university to be a dentist and wanted to put up his shingle in any town, would he be allowed by the dental organisation to do so? Of course he would not. He would not get supplies. Even the dental mechanics in most States are not allowed to fit dentures. They make the dentures to be fitted by the dentists. The dentists take the impressions in the front room and take them out to the back. The dental mechanic never sees the patient to whom the dentures are fitted. It is left to the person who extracts the teeth. If that is not compulsory unionism and a closed shop, what is? I hope that in my own State in the not too distant future dental mechanics will be registered. They will be able to make and fit dentures for people. They cannot do that at present as they can in Tasmania. A Labor government in Tasmania allowed the registration of dental mechanics. These people should be registered. The dentists themselves make the huge incomes, not the people who work in the back rooms manufacturing the dentures. Senator MacGibbon well knows that.

       We can consider the situation of doctors. No doctor could go to any town in Australia and set himself up in a clinic or even in a one-man show because the other doctors would not allow him to use the facilities of the hospital. They would blackball him. This has happened on many occasions. Some years ago it happened in Whyalla. When a private doctor went there to consult, he was told immediately that he would not have available to him the facilities of the Whyalla hospital. We could go on to the chemists. If a chemist went to any town or suburb wanting to open up a chemist's shop, he would soon find himself in the position of not being able to get supplies because that profession is a closed shop. It is just the same as the union situation.

        —That was Senator MacGibbon. There is an old saying, 'If you cannot stand the heat in the kitchen, get out'. That is just what he has done. I have great pleasure in addressing you, Mr Deputy President, because I have high regard for you. As I was saying, we never hear honourable senators opposite or members of Tory governments complain about chambers of commerce and chambers of manufacture, because the members of those organisations are the people who fund such governments. No doubt that is why we find such hostility to a certain piece of legislation which has been introduced into this Parliament. I cannot talk about that legislation, although I do not think it is on the Notice Paper yet as it came before the Senate only today. There has been a back bench reaction because some members of the Government back bench do not want to see the people who support them having to pay up like pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, the people who pay their tax every week when they get their pay packets. There is no way they can evade tax but the captains of industry can. One of the reasons why industry is failing in this country is that it has become such a rort. That is one of the reasons why the Government has not got enough money to spend on capital works.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Honourable senators opposite may say that private enterprise is the backbone of the country but I think that is completely wrong. If governments do not provide the capital works program that should be provided-goodness knows, more capital works programs need to be carried out in this country today-there are no openings for private enterprise to manufacture the articles that governments require to carry out extensive public works. The sooner private enterprise wakes up to that fact the better.

       The Government of South Australia in 1979, as soon as it was elected, set about running down the departments responsible for public buildings, highways, engineering and water supply. It did away with all the day labour and handed all the work over to private contractors. It has reached the stage now where the Bannon Labor Government will find itself in dire straits in trying to get the expertise to build up those departments again. Worse than that, the Bannon Labor Government will have to spend taxpayers' money on purchasing new machinery to bring the machinery capacity up to the stage it had reached when the Labor Government went out of office in South Australia in 1979. Much of the very good machinery we had at that time was sold at very low prices-I would say at peppercorn prices-to private contractors who have worn it out in their haste to make a quick buck. In the main it is the taxpayers of South Australia who have suffered. I am very pleased that because of the awareness of the electors in that State we now have a Labor Government. I am sure that in the next three years the Labor Government will do its very best to put South Australia back on the economic footing it deserves to be on and on which it was before the previous Labor Government was defeated in 1979.

       I want to refer to a few remarks that I made in this place on 14 November 1979. I warned then that the Tonkin Government would have to deliver the goods or it would find itself back in Opposition. I am not a clairvoyant. There were some clairvoyants about leading up to the election. One bloke had to apologise in the Adelaide Advertiser either yesterday or today because he miscued. He was completely wrong when he forecast that the Tonkin Government would be returned to office. He was completely wrong. I have no faith in clairvoyants. I always deal with facts. Most of the statistics which I give in this place are compiled by recognised bodies. On 14 November 1979 I said that the Tonkin Government had been elected on untruthful election promises made not only by the Leader of the Opposition but also by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and business people in that State. I said that they would live to rue the day. I referred to an advertisement that had appeared in the newspaper. I stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to an advertisement that appeared in the Advertiser of 14 September-
      </para>
      <para>
       That is, 14 September 1979-
      </para>
      <para>
       together with a map of Australia. The advertisement reads:
      </para>
      <para>
       'South Australia still has the highest unemployment rate in Australia'.
      </para>
      <para>
       That's 8.2 per cent or 40,000 people out of work.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, those figures were misleading to this extent: The unemployment figure had been overstated by 0.6 per cent. The true figure was 7.6 per cent. What is the figure in that State today? The latest figure which we have been given shows that the unemployment rate is nearly 9 per cent. About 55,000 people are out of work. Mr Tonkin was elected on a promise to stop the job rot. That promise was never honoured. As I have said in this chamber on repeated occasions, the only promise that Mr Tonkin ever honoured in the three years he was in office was to abolish death duties and gift duties. Of course, a lot of wage earners and working people voted for him not realising, of course, that under the previous Corcoran Government and Dunstan Government there was an exemption of $80,000 in respect of death duties. A husband and wife in joint ownership of a home could have assets to the value of $160,000. When one partner passed away the other would be exempt from paying death duty because they were in partnership. Who is paying for those promises that Mr Tonkin carried out? The pensioners, the unemployed and the people in the work force are paying because all State costs were put up by the Government to try to recover the $32m which was lost to revenue by the abolition of death duties and gift duties. We saw a massive escalation in the price of electricity, water and bus fares. Every avenue that was open to the State Government to raise money was exploited to try to recoup that money.
      </para>
      <para>
       On top of that the State Government, under Mr Tonkin, sold off the State assets . South Australia had a very good land commission which was set up under the jurisdiction of Mr Dunstan in co-operation with the Whitlam Government. People were able to purchase land at reasonable prices. What did Mr Tonkin do? He got rid of the land commission. He handed land over to private developers. We had the Monarto commission which was established not many miles away from where I live. What happened to that? It was sold back to farmers. I am very disturbed when I go past that area now and see that all the magnificent trees planted during the reign of the Dunstan and Corcoran governments are dying through lack of attention. A very extensive reafforestation program was carried out in that area. Land has been sold back to farmers who, at the first opportunity, will again clear it. Trees on the area retained by the Government are not being looked after properly in my view. One can drive along the freeway and see trees dying in their hundreds. The trees ought to be watered in this time of drought to keep them alive. That is something else which happened under the Tonkin Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I could go right through, chapter and verse what I said on 14 November 1979 about what would happen under a Tonkin Government. What I said would happen has happened. One of the things that disturbed me was that on Tuesday, 13 November, nearly two months after the Tonkin Government was elected, a big supplement was published in the Advertiser. It was headed: 'South Australia. We hold it in our hands'. On 14 November 1979 I stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       It was claimed to be presented by the commercial radio and television stations of South Australia in the interests of our State. The advertisement states:

       What this means is we can have confidence. Confidence in ourselves, our neighbours, our community and our State.
      </para>
      <para>
       And its future.
      </para>
      <para>
       So let's show it. And then stand back and watch South Australia grow.

      <para>
       South Australia. It's our State, mate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Is it our State? What has happened? That advertisement was published in the daily Press about two months after Tonkin was elected. Of course, it implied that all those things happened after the election in September. Nothing of that kind occurred. All those things were in the pipeline. They were all operative under the Dunstan and Corcoran Labor governments. No credit was given to the Labor governments in those misleading advertisements leading up to the election. We found shortly after the election that advertisements appeared claiming all the credit for what was going on. I will refer later to a statement that was incorporated in Hansard by Senator Carrick during the last week the Parliament sat. He claimed that a whole list of industries had come to South Australia under the Tonkin Liberal Government. How misleading was that statement? I will refer to it later. On 14 November 1979 I went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       The chickens are already coming home to roost. Those people have to live with their statements.
      </para>
      <para>
       They are the people to whom I have referred. I continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       As I said in this Parliament some days ago, the present Government in South Australia was elected on an untruth, and it has to live with it. It will have to answer to the electors at the first opportunity when it goes to the people. Along with my colleagues, I will be continually reminding the people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Missen interjected and said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Is that a promise?
      </para>
      <para>
       I replied:
      </para>
      <para>
       That is a promise. I will continually remind the people of how they were misled by the false advertising put out by the people who are claiming that South Australia is a great State.
      </para>
      <para>
       I could go on at some length about what I said on that day. I referred to another plank of the platform on which Mr Tonkin was elected-that he fully supported the policies of the Fraser Government. What has he been saying since Saturday night? He is blaming the Fraser Government for his defeat. He is not big enough or man enough to admit that his own policies brought the State to its knees and brought about his defeat. He is now turning around and blaming the Fraser Government for its policies. He is on record as saying that. I have read it in the paper, and I saw him on television on Saturday night very late. But there is the man who was elected saying that he fully supported the Fraser policies. Of course, the right thinking people in the electorate, when they got the opportunity last Saturday, reversed the decision of three years ago and they have now re-elected a Labor government.
      </para>
      <para>
       In my final remarks in my speech on 14 November 1979 I said:
      </para>
      <para>
       This is not the last time that I will be on my feet talking about these things in the remaining three years of the Tonkin Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the last 12 months I have repeatedly given notices of motion pointing out just what has happened to the State of South Australia. In those notices of motion I have used figures and quotations from information which is provided to the community at large by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They have not been figures cooked up by the Labor Party. All those notices of motion are on the Notice Paper, and I shall have to do something tomorrow to have them removed because the people of South Australia have been alerted to what was going on and have made their decision, so it is no use leaving the notices of motion there to be debated because they are now out of date.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us look at what happened in this Parliament on 19 October. Senator Carrick was answering a question put to him by my colleague Senator Elstob about cost increases in South Australia. I have referred to some of those increases, but Senator Elstob had referred to the massive increase in hospital charges. He cited the increase in the price of a loaf of bread, and quite a few other things . During Senator Carrick's answer, Senator Walsh, referring to South Australia, said:
      </para>
      <para>
       It has the highest unemployment on the mainland and 8,000 people a year are leaving the State.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Carrick said in reply:
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, honourable senators opposite do not like to hear the constructive things that are happening.
      </para>
      <para>
       I interjected and said:
      </para>
      <para>
       They don't like to hear distortions of fact. That is what we don't like.
      </para>
      <para>
       And neither do we like them. Senator Carrick went on to talk about some of the things for which he claimed credit in South Australia. Referring to the Opposition, he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       They do not like to hear of the vigorous actions of the South Australian Liberal Government in attracting industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The next day I put a question to Senator Carrick. I asked him just what industry had been attracted to South Australia during the reign of the Liberal Government . Whilst he went to great lengths to talk about the development of the Cooper Basin, I remind him that the Tonkin Liberal Government had nothing to do with the development of the Cooper Basin and that the Cooper Basin was developed under State Labor Governments, both the Dunstan Government and the Corcoran Government. I went on to ask Senator Carrick:
      </para>
      <para>
       What are the names of the companies which have come to South Australia? What is the number of people employed at present in each of these industries? Finally, is it not a fact that even if the feasibility study being carried out at Roxby Downs gives the go-ahead, it will be at least nine years before jobs, in significant numbers, will be created?
      </para>
      <para>
       That is what I posed to Senator Carrick. Then I asked this supplementary question about the companies that he said had come to South Australia:
      </para>
      <para>
       I ask the Minister whether he could provide the names of the companies and he said that he would. Obviously, when he made the statement yesterday he must have known because, according to Hansard, he claimed that the South Australian Liberal Government had attracted industries. I now ask the Minister: Can I have that answer prior to 6 November so that we can ascertain whether, in fact these industries have been attracted to South Australia?
      </para>
      <para>
       On 28 October Senator Carrick rose after Question Time-unfortunately I was not present, otherwise I might have sought leave to make a statement-and he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       On 20 October Senator McLaren asked me a question without notice concerning industry development in South Australia. I undertook to seek out the names of companies that had come to South Australia during the term of office of the Tonkin Government
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the answer that disturbs me, because many of the 84 companies that Senator Carrick listed were already in South Australia long before the Tonkin Government ever came to office. Here we had Senator Carrick standing in this place and incorporating in Hansard a list of 84 companies which he claims came to South Australia during the reign of the Tonkin Liberal Government. My colleague Senator Robert Ray interjected. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The other interjection was: How many have left?
      </para>
      <para>
       But Senator Carrick conveniently ignored that. Nothing has been put in this Hansard as to how many companies had left the State. Nor did Senator Carrick say , in answering my question, how many people were employed by the companies on that long list. In answer to Senator Ray's interjection, he went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       I will pick up the interjection: 'How many have left?' The annual reports of the South Australian Corporate Affairs Commission show that in 1979-80 and in 1980-81-that is two of the three years of the Tonkin Government-nearly 7000 new companies registered in South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is all very well to register companies, but one can register a company that does not necessarily employ anyone. Senator Carrick did not go on to tell us that. He never told us, either, how many people were employed in those 7000 new companies. He listed 84 companies, thinking that he might get some kudos for Mr Tonkin. But he gave no answer as to how many people were employed by those companies. Concluding his answer, he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I have obtained from South Australia's Department of Trade and Industry a list comprising 84 major manufacturing projects, with total project costs amounting to more than $250m, which have been completed in South Australia since October 1979.
      </para>
      <para>
       We all know that most of those industries were in South Australia prior to 1979 or were in the course of construction. But Senator Carrick was very emphatic in his remarks. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I repeat, they represent projects that have been completed. Of course, they do not take into account the very substantial developments that are now taking place.
      </para>
      <para>
       He went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, taken together, they more than confirm the evidence that the Tonkin Government has achieved the attracting of very substantial industry to South Australia. I repeat, the details cover only two of the three years involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Then Senator Carrick gave a list of the companies that he claims were attracted to South Australia by the Tonkin Government. The first on the list is Abbott Australasia Pty Ltd. That company has been in South Australia for a long time. I have never heard that it came there only recently and was attracted there by Mr Tonkin. The next is Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd. That is mentioned twice, with an amount of money. But looking at the details, one finds that they are expansions to those companies. They are not companies that have been attracted there; they are expansions. Many of those expansions were in the pipeline long before Mr Tonkin ever got to the treasury bench. On the list also is Angliss, William &amp; Co. at Wingfield, with the notation 'Establishment to manufacture tennis strings'. How much did that project attract to South Australia? It was $ 300,000. It did not employ many people, because we did not get the figures. Australian Bacon Ltd at Adelaide-Mount Barker is listed for an amenities block costing $200,000. That company has long been operating in South Australia. Berri Fruit Juices Co-op Ltd, at Berri, has long been operative in South Australia. Bridgestone Australia Pty Ltd, at Edwardstown, another expansion, has long been in South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are six listings for Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, three at Port Pirie and three at Whyalla. What has happened to those industries? Particularly at Whyalla, the work force is being retrenched at a rapid rate under the Tonkin Government. Of course, the shipbuilding industry was lost under the jurisdiction of the Fraser Government. When my colleague former Senator Bishop was in this place, he repeatedly reminded the Government of broken promises about keeping the shipyard open at Whyalla.

       Next on the list is CSR Ltd at Glanville, and the upgrading of a sugar refinery , for $4m. That was an established industry many years ago. Then there is Charles David Pty Ltd, at Murray Bridge, and the upgrading of abattoirs. I live there. I can say categorically that that industry did not just come there in the last three years. It has been in South Australia for many years. Then we have listed Codan Pty Ltd, at Newton; Colan Shipbuilders Pty Ltd/Colan Engineers Pty Ltd, at Port Adelaide; The Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd; Crowhurst, W. P. Pty Ltd, at Devon Park, an expansion; Dairy Vale Metro Co-operative Ltd. at Jerbois. We come on to Faulding, and Freesia Ice Cream with the note 'relocation and expansion'. Freesia Ice Cream was an industry that was at Murray Bridge. The first job that I had when I went to Murray Bridge in 1950 was working as a builder's labourer mixing mortar to rebuild the factory which had been burnt down. It was owned by Smythe Brothers. It was burned down in about 1949. We have it listed here as some achievement of the Tonkin Liberal Government because it has transferred from Murray Bridge to Adelaide.
      </para>
      <para>
       We then get Furness Ltd-'relocation and new factory'. We all know that Furness used to make very worthwhile and very good caravans in South Australia. It is not a new industry to South Australia. It is a long established industry. We then have listed General Motors-Holden's Ltd at Elizabeth. That company was there long before Mr Tonkin came to government. What is General Motors-Holden's doing now? It is retrenching employees in very large numbers. I can go on. He lists Messengers Press Pty Ltd, which is retrenching employees and closing down a lot of its throw-away papers; yet it is listed here as a great achievement. Mobil Oil Australia Ltd's lube oil refinery expansion operation is also listed. Mobil has been in South Australia for many years. I think it went there when the late Thomas Playford was Premier of the State. But that does not worry Senator Carrick in claiming it as an achievement for Mr Tonkin. The Onkaparinga Woollen Co. Ltd mill at Lobethal is retrenching workers. That company has been there for many years. We can look further to O.E. and D.R. Pope Pty Ltd at Kent Town. It is going to retrench workers this week. I also include the Port Lincoln Ship Construction Co. and the Port Lincoln Tuna Processors Pty Ltd, which has been catching tuna at Port Lincoln from as far back as I can remember, but it is claimed here as an achievement for the Tonkin Government. Sapfor Timber Mills Ltd at Tarpeena is the company which put off 75 workers recently and I complained about it in the Parliament, yet it is claimed as an achievement. B. Seppelt and Sons Ltd at Tanunda, John Shearer Ltd at Mile End and at Kilkenny, Simpson Ltd at Regency Park, Softwood Holdings Ltd at Mount Gambier-which is mentioned four times-the South Australian Brewing Co. Ltd, the South Australian Fishermen's Co-operative Ltd, the Southern Farmers Co-operative Ltd, Tubemakers of Australia Ltd at Kilburn-which has been mentioned twice-Joe White Maltings Ltd, Woods and Forests Department of Mount Gambier and W. H. Wylie and Co. Pty Ltd at Clovelly Park are all retrenching people.
      </para>
      <para>
       How vigorous and viable was the Woods and Forests Department at Mount Gambier under the Dunstan and Corcoran governments when Mr Chatterton was the Minister of Forests? It was very viable, but there could be a problem down there now. It will not eventuate because a story was going around Mount Gambier last week that if Mr Tonkin had been re-elected there would have been severe retrenchments in the State mill. Fortunately that will not happen. All of these things can be listed. I have not listed the lot of them, which were tabled in this Parliament and incorporated in the Hansard by Senator Carrick in an effort to fool the people in South Australia as to what a great achiever Mr Tonkin was in attracting industry to South Australia. Well he got his answer on Saturday. I think the lesson is there for Senator Carrick. If he is going to fight the next Federal election on promises like that, trying to fool the people that the Liberal Goverment will attract industry and create employment, he has another think coming. We saw the happenings in Victoria earlier this year. The people are not fools all the time. As Abraham Lincoln said:
      </para>
      <para>
       You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is what happened in Victoria and in South Australia last Saturday. I join with my parliamentary colleagues on this side of the House in congratulating John Bannon on a magnificent victory. I say to the people who live in South Australia that they can look forward to good, stable and worthwhile government between now and the next election, whenever that may be.

        —I take this opportunity, in speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83, to say a few words about the Budget. I believe the Budget is nothing more than an attempt by the Government to canvass votes for the next Federal election, whenever that will be. It is an addmission by this Government that the restrictive economic policies it has pursued over the last seven years have failed miserably. These policies have plunged Australia into the deepest recession since the 1930s.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This Budget comes at a time when unemployment is at record levels with already something like 500,000 Australians now officially listed as unemployed. It comes at a time when consumer confidence is at its lowest level for nine years and when the costs associated with buying a home are the highest on record. It comes at a time when dwelling approvals are at their lowest level for four years and when interest rates in Australia are among the highest in the world, and it comes at a time when our manufacturing industries are falling apart at the seams .
      </para>
      <para>
       Not a single day goes past now without more companies announcing yet more retrenchments, and the jobs of thousands of Australian workers are now under threat. As recently as 15 September, another 2,500 workers were retrenched by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd at Newcastle and Port Kembla and a further 340 jobs at BHP's Whyalla plant in South Australia have already been lost or are being threatened. According to the Budget Papers, the Australian economy will not grow at all in 1982-83, making it the first time since the early 1960s that the economy has not grown. This Government has thrown economic planning out of the window, its policies are in disarray, and many of its Ministers have been shown to be totally incompetent. This Budget is a short term exercise in electioneering, just as we saw in 1977, when tax cuts were handed out just before the election and taken away not long after. The headlines on page one of the Australian Financial Review of 18 August said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Fraser's seductive Budget is pitched at voters.
      </para>
      <para>
       Quite clearly, it represents a complete reversal in economic strategy. Only last year Government Ministers in this chamber argued against any increase in the Budget deficit and now the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has brought down a Budget with a deficit of over $1,600m. As recently as February of this year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) went on record as saying that tax cuts will lead to more money floating around the economy and hence more inflation. Now he has brought down what would appear to be, on the surface, quite substantial income tax cuts. Of course, what we have not been told is how long these tax cuts are going to last. No guarantees have been made that they will not be taken away again, just as they were in 1977. I think the Canberra Times summed up the Budget quite effectively with the following words:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Budget is the work of men with limited minds, obsessed by a false concept of responsibility, which they somehow inflicted upon far too many Australians.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Sydney Morning Herald also launched an attack on the Budget and the motives behind it. It said:
      </para>
      <para>
       From the Government's point of view the Budget offers only one hope: The hope of re-election, and that is just not good enough.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Melbourne Age, in its editorial headed 'Budget for an Election', said quite rightly:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer has admitted that it will do nothing to reduce inflation and that it cannot prevent an increase in unemployment. The strategy of seven years has failed; the hopes of an investment-led or consumer-led or resources-led recovery have faded; the boast of superior economic management has, by international comparisons been exposed as hollow.
      </para>
      <para>
       So there we have it. Nearly every editorial in this country has labelled this Budget as a shallow piece of economic hogwash and seen it as a deliberate attempt to sway the middle ground swinging voters. As Bob Hawke said in the other place, and I must say I think he was quite generous, this truly is a ' Mickey Mouse Budget'. It is the sort of con trick one would expect to come from a government led by Idi Amin or the Ayotollah Khomeini.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now want to look specifically at some of the contents of the Budget. In doing so, I want to say that I welcome the relief that has been given to many Australians, but overall I am afraid it is a case of too little, too late. Moreover, I share the concern of many people that the cuts may not be lasting, and that we may be in for a repeat of 1977-78 when income tax cuts were granted, only to be followed by an income tax surcharge less than 12 months afterwards.
      </para>
      <para>
       One point in particular I make in relation to the income tax cuts is that all of the tax relief measures announced in the Budget did not come into effect until November. In the meantime, indirect taxes, such as the sales taxes and the excise on beer and cigarettes annouced in the Budget, came into effect immediately after the Budget. This is clearly a ridiculous situation. If these measures were going to be as important in contributing to a consumer-led recovery as the Treasurer claims, they should have been backdated to July or at least to the day of the Budget. That would have given people more substantial relief and provided a much needed boost to retail sales.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the housing front, while mortgage repayments on the average home loan have gone up by something like $25 a week over the last 2 1/2 years, the average amount of assistance provided by means of the home loan interest rebate will be between $5.05 a week and $8.65 a week. This is a long way short of the increase in repayments brought about by rising interest rates. One section of the community which will be hardest hit by this Budget are those on fixed incomes- the pensioners and the unemployed. The standard pension rate currently represents 21.9 per cent of average weekly earnings, considerably less than the 24.5 per cent it represented in 1975. The Budget brings only superficial relief in that the tax threshold has been lifted from $4,195 to $4,595, together with a rebate of $250. However, this applied only from November, which means that the maximum rebate will be only $167, with pensioners still paying tax if they earn over $5,007. This means that a large number of the 300,000 pensioners and low income earners the Treasurer stated will not be paying tax this year will, in fact, end up doing so anyway.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another inadequate provision is the supplementary rent assistance given to pensioners renting private accommodation. This has been increased by a miserable $2 a week at a time when rents have gone up something like $10 to $15 a week. Also, there is still no such supplementary assistance paid to the unemployed, just as the unemployed have still not been granted the same sorts of fringe benefits which apply to pensioners. In fact, this Government has shown such callous disregard for the unemployed, that the rate of unemployment benefit paid to persons without dependants is still $12.85 below the single pension rate. Even worse is the miserable increase of only $4 a week granted to young unemployed people aged 16 and 17. How they are expected to live on the paltry sum of $40 a week is beyond me. It is about time the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) came to grips with the sorts of problems being faced by Australia's homeless young people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Even one of the Government's own senators has recognised the inadequacy of the present level of benefit paid to young unemployed people. When Senator Walters was commenting on the report on homeless youth by the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, she said:
      </para>
      <para>
       It would seem that the present philosophy of the Government with regard to the junior unemployment rate of, as it was, $36 is that it is only meant to support those 16 and 17-year-olds living in the parental home. The economic and social factors on which the junior rate was set six years ago have altered significantly and it is therefore important that the Government make clear the basis on which the junior rate is determined and that that rate is expected to cover. Not only would it be impossible for anyone to live independently on $36 a week, but in the case of a number of other unemployed youth, that amount of money would not be sufficient to support them in the family home, particularly if the parents are unemployed or are in receipt of a pension. While I am encouraged by the recent Budget announcement to lift this rate by 11 per cent, to $40 as from November 1982, it still does not lessen the concerns I have just raised.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, must use his influence in Cabinet to bring about a more equitable situation. The fact is, one simply cannot force all 16 or 17-year-olds to stay at home with their parents until they reach the age of 18, no matter what one may think is right personally. In refusing to raise the level of benefits for 16 and 17-year-olds above $40 a week , the Government has no doubt forced many of these young people into prostitution and exposed them to drug traffickers and other underworld characters. The $4 increase in the amount of unemployment benefit paid to 16 and 17-year-olds is the first increase for seven years and represents a massive decrease in the real value of that benefit of 50 per cent over the life of this Government. Just to remain at 1975-76 levels in real terms, the benefit would have to have been increased to something like $65 to $70 a week. The maximum rate payable to 16 and 17-year-olds has fallen from 24.5 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1975 to just 11 per cent in the June quarter of 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another deficiency of the Budget is the failure to increase the amount available for emergency relief at a time when voluntary organisations are being pushed to the brink with people in urgent need of food and shelter. The indirect tax increases, such as the increases in sales taxes across the board and the increase in the beer and tobacco excise, will certainly hurt the pensioners, the unemployed and everybody else in the community who depends on fixed incomes.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn briefly to the new fuel tax to be introduced as part of the so-called Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. This new tax on motorists is apparently designed to contribute $150m to the construction of our national road system. But the fact of the matter is that it is merely a ploy to raise more revenue, to make up for the decrease in real allocations to the States, under the Roads Grants Act, in 1982-83. This Government has deliberately ignored our road system for the past seven years, and as a result, we have one of the worst road systems in the developed world. Small two-lane country roads covered with potholes are meant to take us between our major cities. The Government's failure to remedy this has no doubt contributed to the high number of fatalities on our country roads. Our national highway system is an absolute shambles. The amounts to be spent in 1982-83 will certainly not go far enough to alleviate the problem .
      </para>
      <para>
       I now want to speak about what I consider to be the most serious deficiency in the 1982-83 Budget. It concerns the inability of this Budget to provide any solution to the growing unemployment problem in this country. In fact, the Government has finally admitted that it is completely and utterly helpless. This was summed up very well by Ken Davidson in the Age on 18 August 1982 when he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       It's now official. The Government has abandoned the full employment objective which has hitherto been the stated objective of all parties and governments since the Chifley Government published its White Paper on full employment in 1945.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Budget contains absolutely nothing for the unemployed. It leaves them in complete despair and with no hope for the future. The Treasurer has admitted that unemployment will rise to 8 per cent in this financial year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Flinders University Institute of Labour Studies has predicted that the number of unemployed people will increase to at least 700,000 in 1982-83, an average of some 75 per cent over 1981-82. This will represent an increase in unemployment over the last two years of nearly 100 per cent. Yet, while all this has been happening, staffing levels in the Commonwealth Employment Service have been falling. In 1981-82 there was an 8 per cent reduction in CES staff at a time when unemployment increased by 26 per cent. In 1982-83, according to the Budget estimates, staffing levels will increase by only one per cent. We have seen a 7 per cent effective reduction in CES staff over the last two years. This is a measure of this Government's concern for the unemployed.
      </para>
      <para>
       We can spend all the money in the world on training schemes but they do not create real jobs. In my home state of South Australia the situation is particularly bad in the outer suburban areas, with the unemployment rate in the Elizabeth and Munno Para areas north of Adelaide estimated to be about 32 per cent of the work force, that is, one in every three people. Similarly, in Whyalla, the unemployment rate is estimated to be about 31 per cent, according to Department of Social Security figures, and in the Morphett Vale-Noarlunga areas it is about 26 per cent. Youth unemployment in South Australia is now hovering around 30 per cent.

       Since the beginning of the year we have seen General Motors-Holden's Ltd retrench 220 workers. One hundred workers have lost their jobs at the Mount Barker tannery, 105 were retrenched by Alco Industries (Aust.) Pty Ltd at Elizabeth, 125 by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd at Whyalla, 50 by the Kenwood organisation, 420 by Kelvinator Australia Ltd, with more to come, 95 by Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, 75 by Sapfor Timber Mills Ltd and so the list goes on. This Budget will do absolutely nothing to stop this disastrous trend. It will do nothing to aid manufacturing industries. It certainly does nothing to assist small business people in the community. The sales tax increases on cars and white goods will only add to the plight of these industries in the next 12 months. The industries are vital to South Australia and in the face of intense competition from imports and dumped products from Asia, especially in the white goods area, these sales tax increases can lead only to more unemployment in these industries over the next 12 months.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Budget is a culmination of seven years of the most incompetent and corrupt government that Australia has seen. The Government has ripped off the ordinary Australian people for the last seven years, with the proportion of the tax burden borne by the pay-as-you-earn wage and salary earners rising from 41.7 per cent in 1975-76 to around 45.4 per cent in 1982-83. Australia has one of the highest rates of income tax among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The changes to the tax scales included in this Budget are a deliberate attempt by this Government to pull the wool over people's eyes. While it has granted some miserable tax cuts to wage and salary earners, the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population are still getting away with thousands of millions of dollars in unpaid tax. As the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union showed, since 1975, whilst the actual number of companies has increased or remained constant, the number of companies paying tax has fallen by around 20, 000. In 1982-83 the amount of tax paid by companies will actually fall by one per cent, which represents an 11 per cent or 12 per cent reduction in real terms . Meanwhile, the average taxpayer is now paying 83 per cent more in tax than he was when the Fraser Government came to power.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Budget is summed up very well in an article by Brian Toohey in the National Times in which he states:
      </para>
      <para>
       The pervasive mood underlying last Tuesday's Budget is one of helplessness. The economy is careering towards the cliff edge and the Government has taken its hand off the wheel.
      </para>
      <para>
       All that this Government has in the way of a so-called economic strategy is wage moderation. In other words, what it is advocating is that to solve our problems the ordinary working men and women of this country have to accept a drop in living standards. What an admission of failure. As Brian Toohey said in the National Times:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . If low wages were an unqualified good, Bangladesh should be a shining example of economic wisdom.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think this speaks for itself. As the editorial in the conservative Australian Financial Review said, in commenting on the Budget:
      </para>
      <para>
       It has left Australia without a wage policy, indeed without an economic policy. It has guaranteed that the social and economic costs of the recession will not be shared equitably, but will be concentrated on the unemployed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I, for one, do not think that the Australian people will be conned by this Budget. I think they will see it for what it really is, a cheap and nasty attempt to win votes for the election, whenever it is. I condemn this Budget for its total failure to come to grips with Australia's economic problems and for its failure to provide an economic strategy to revive the Australian economy.

        —I take this opportunity of speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) to draw attention to the crisis in the provision of basic shelter. Today Australia has the highest real interest rates for housing since the Second World War. The statement by my colleague Senator McLaren this afternoon, drawing attention to the fact that one of the largest private banks is now taking the first steps to foreclose on people who are unemployed, is indicative of the problems that many Australians face because of high interest rates and the general failure of the Fraser Government's housing policies. At the same time, thousands of Australians are living in sub-standard or over priced accommodation. A recent report from Philippa Smith of the New South Wales Council of Social Service showed that people on low incomes are paying phenomenal percentages of those incomes in rent. In many cases people on low incomes or people receiving social services benefits are paying half the money they receive in rent. Indeed, some of these people are paying all their money on shelter. They are eating into their accumulated resources of a lifetime because they cannot get adequate shelter at reasonable cost.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       We have a housing policy crisis. The Fraser Government's attitude when facing this crisis has been to get rid of the Department of Housing and Construction, to prevent the overall view being in the hands of one department, to fragment the former ministry and give responsibilities for housing to the Department of Social Security, the Department of Transport and Construction and other government departments. I think that sums up the cynicism with which the Fraser Government has tackled the housing problem. Of course, we also have to consider the fact that the complete burden of housing has been thrown onto the States. In addition to the States, the most obvious recipients of the ball thrown away by the Fraser Government, local government is increasingly facing problems because of the shelter crisis.
      </para>
      <para>
       Funds for public housing have been slashed by two-thirds since 1974. That is the level of crisis that I am describing. Since the last full year of a Labor government the actual money available has been slashed by two-thirds. This represents in public houses 75,000 dwellings that could have been built. In other words, we do not have those 75,000 dwellings because of the slow and deliberate policy of the Fraser Government to reduce our housing stock. I will contrast this chaos at the Federal level with some of the innovations that are taking place in local government. But I think we have to look for new solutions at the national level to meet what, after unemployment, is the greatest social problem that this nation faces. With regard to housing as a social good, I think the Government has given lip service to housing but I feel that we have to go further than the Government is prepared to go. Special consideration must be given to the economic cost of housing and the economic benefit of a flourishing housing industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that housing investment need not hinder the economic growth of our country; quite the reverse, I believe that we should use money on housing to aid recovery and to aid growth at this moment when unemployment is reaching unparalleled proportions, even with the acknowledged background of the Fraser Government. We have a tremendous crisis in unemployment to which my colleague Senator Foreman has referred. The fact is that we have to use housing in trying to resolve that problem. I am indebted to Hugh Stretton who indicated, in a paper entitled 'Housing-An Investment For All', a number of positive aspects of the housing industry that I commend to honourable senators. For example, he has pointed out that between one-third and one quarter of material goods and services are produced in households. That is a novel thought because it involves the issue that housework and a number of other activities do take place in the household. He stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       Somewhere between a third and 45 per cent of our material goods and services are produced in households, or by other unpaid labour in other co-operative organizations. That output is likely to go on increasing in volume and importance. Whether or not we're in for substantial technological unemployment, we certainly face shorter hours of paid work, longer education and longer retirement, and altogether more leisure. The capital resources of household and neighbourhood and voluntary association seem likely to be more important than ever.
      </para>
      <para>
       He continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       So we need appropriate allocation of capital between households and other productive users.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think that is a novel thought but it is a realistic appreciation of the fact that more and more is going to occur in the areas that he has described and so there is even more need for us to have a progressive and vital housing industry. Hugh Stretton went on to refer to the attributes of the building industry. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The house-building industry can be a stable, long-term-reliable one, while at the same time running with extreme competitive efficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       We all know that the efficiency of the industry is based on the fact that we have everything in the building industry from a one person organisation to large construction companies. The advantage of the housing industry is that it is also an industry that allows for development in that it has an employment multiplier of one to one. For every person employed directly in the housing and construction industry there is one person employed in the consequential industries which back it up. In the paper that I have referred to, Hugh Stretton made the point that it is an industry that is protected naturally. It needs no tariffs. I thought that might appeal to some Government senators who are obsessed with the protection of industry. The import component in the housing industry is a very modest one. If it was necessary even to reduce some of the luxury items that go into the housing industry-or perhaps the top end of the housing industry for the people who are closely aligned with the Liberal and National parties-then we could reduce still further the import section of the housing industry simply by taking some action to prevent the luxury end of the industry from being flooded with material from overseas that is not necessary for the 80 or 90 per cent of Australian people who want modest but reasonable shelter.

       The other factor that I think is common knowledge to everybody, but is worth restating, is that the building industry can provide employment for people whether they be unskilled, semi-skilled or skilled. To this extent, in looking at an economic recovery, as we are in the Labor Party, the use of that work force in the housing industry, one that can quickly be put to work, would be something that we regard as very desirable. It would quickly reduce the battalions of unemployed people who have been conscripted into this Government's so-called campaign against inflation, the unfortunate people who are suffering at present throughout this country. The housing industry would give us all these attributes and yet the very appropriations that we face today indicate that the Government has done so very little for it.

       One of the things that Hugh Stretton emphasised in his paper is the fact that there seems to be some correlation between some of the countries that have been credited with economic miracles-Sweden, West Germany, Holland, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. He points out that one of the common factors in the economic success of all of those diverse countries is that they have taken action to support their housing and construction industries. He said that if we look at the celebrated economic miracles of those years in which these countries expended great moneys in their housing industries, it does not take long to see as he puts it, that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Those countries directed to housing construction about twice the resouces that market forces alone would have done, and while doing that, and partly by doing that, they led the world in economic growth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thus a viable and vibrant housing industry, which certainly requires the input of more effort than market forces alone can produce, is able to produce of itself a satisfactory rate of growth. That subject was taken up by another world famous economist, Barbara Ward, in her book The Home of Man. Commenting on the German experience, she said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the Germans have proved that if a resourceful and hard-working people devote a steady five or six per cent of their gross national product to housing a vast transformaton can be achieved in only two decades. Nor can anyone, following the growth of the German economy through the same period, argue that the priority for housing has acted as much of a drag on other sectors. On the contrary, the very steadiness and comprehensiveness of the program has been an important stimulus to the rest of the economy . . . If wealthy industrialized countries want to give their citizens decent homes, they can.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thus we have evidence from other countries that the expenditure of money in the general provision of shelter for our people can produce general economic gain for the community as a whole.
      </para>

       I would like briefly to contrast the initiative taken by this Government with that shown by one of the smallest municipal councils in the city of Sydney. I refer to the Waverley Council, whose activities cover some of the most attractive parts of Sydney, including Bondi Beach and a number of other eastern suburbs beaches. The municipality lies close to my home and I know that the Council has taken steps to combat the special problems that it faces. Bondi and neighbouring areas of Sydney attract many unemployed young people. They crowd into flats, so that many live in unsatisfactory conditions. That lack of accommodation is the direct result of inadequate financing for the provision of homes and shelter. The Waverley Council has taken action to endeavour to maximise the accommodation available, but in so doing it has not been dogmatic. It has made sure that its activities have been combined with those of the local community, including the house building industry and the housing industry generally. In addition it set out in April 1980 to appoint a community housing officer. That was done with the complete support of the State Labor Government. An attempt has been made to evaluate how such an officer can assist a council that is burdened because of the magnet Bondi Beach represents for so many young people.
      </para>
      <para>
       The aim of the Council, the aldermen, the community housing officer and other officials has been to create an integrated policy framework and, most particularly, to adopt an interventionist approach in order to try to house the people who come to its area. In that regard the Council has been very successful . By research and analysis it has sought to monitor the capacity of the local area to provide housing. It has looked at its own stock and has set out to provide housing by way of flats and other low income shelter. By engaging in joint ventures with developers it has tried to increase housing availability. In addition, group approaches have been made to charitable and other organisations in the area with a view to looking after those who have special problems. I refer to the aged, the mildly intellectually handicapped and homeless youth. At all times the Council has encouraged self-management in regard to housing issues , especially in 'share a home', an innovative approach for young people. This has been in addition to its work on the single women's refuge program. If the results of the intervention by Waverley Council, in particular its promotion of interaction between local, State and national housing interests, are viewed as beneficial, it is most important that we in the national Parliament consider more seriously the direction that housing is to take in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I said at the outset, the answer of this Government has been to reduce dramatically the amount of housing finance that it makes available. It has abolished its housing and construction ministry. It has thrown to a number of other departments, in a piecemeal way, the responsibility for providing housing. In the eyes of the Australian people, the actions of the Government in regard to this second most important issue, after unemployment, especially in view of the combined problems of unemployment and lack of shelter that people face today, are such that it stands condemned and must be judged as an abject failure in combating the lack of housing that exists at present.

         —I was not able to attend the hearings of Estimates Committee A because Estimates Committee C was meeting at the same time . That happened over and over again. I wish to raise a matter that I believe was not the subject of more than a few questions. It involves the Commonwealth Reporting Service and what I regard as an uneconomic and discriminatory policy adopted by the Commonwealth Reporting Service management towards the Melbourne branch. In particular, I refer to what I regard as inadequate answers by Mr Green, the Chief Reporter of the Commonwealth Reporting Service in Canberra, to questions asked by Estimates Committee A on 13 September 1982. What has been represented by the Commonwealth Reporting Service management as a rationalisation of operations is simply, in my view, bad management. Discussions of the Melbourne Commonwealth Reporting Service personnel with senior Commonwealth Reporting Service officers suggested the possibility of the Melbourne and Sydney offices of that body being reorientated as recording centres. That would be away from extensive transcript preparation. This proposal was raised over two years ago, but at no time were the current Melbourne staff informed of the management's intentions.

       <para>
        Although it may be denied officially, Melbourne typists were told on 26 August that significant areas of Melbourne generated work would be exclusively sent interstate in future. These areas include all Family Court of Australia work, Federal bankruptcy, Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Australian Taxation Office work. Mr Green is alleged to have said that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission work could also be sent interstate. It is true that additional casual staff have been employed in Adelaide to cover the Melbourne work load. The percentage of transcription work transferred from Melbourne over the last 12 months was not 30 per cent, as stated by Mr Green, but rather a 60: 40 ratio for the period 1 July 1981 to 30 June 1982. Since then the position has got worse. If, and only if, existing Melbourne facilities and personnel were unable to cope with the work load there might be some rational reason for transferring work interstate. Even then, the fact that work originates in Melbourne would be a powerful argument, I believe, for expanding the Melbourne office of the Commonwealth Reporting Service.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the fact that existing facilities in Melbourne are underutilised at the moment-no justification for this has been put forward-in my view, it was completely misleading for Mr Green to say that the work in Melbourne is queuing up or left to lie in one place for a week. Rarely, if ever, is a complete roster of the 50 Melbourne typists fully employed. Yet work which could be done in Melbourne in one day is being held over for transfer to Adelaide to such an extent that Adelaide, on occasion, has been overloaded with Melbourne work, part of which has had to be retransferred to Canberra for transcription. In no way can the running down of the Melbourne office of the Commonwealth Reporting Service be seen as improving efficiency in the provision of important public and confidential transcripts for government. I hope that the sending of the work to Adelaide was not politically motivated. It seems to me that the two offices most under threat are Sydney and Melbourne, both of which have State Labor governments. Maybe now that there is a Labor Government in South Australia--

I was in my office at the time and was not in the chamber to listen to him, but as I recall he commented that there was some gross inefficiency, to say the very least, in the Attorney-General's Department and in particular in the Crown Solicitor's Division. He stated that there was some lethargy and perhaps apathy, and certainly some negligence, in their not pursuing the bottom-of-the-harbour taxation scheme promoters as assiduously as perhaps they could have. It has been put to me recently that there were other ways in which the Government could have collected the revenue that it saw as being owing to it than by introducing new and retrospective legislation.

As I am not a lawyer I am not in any way capable of assessing the comments that have been made to me about some sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I wonder whether this is the appropriate time, Madam Temporary Chairman, to raise the issue. I will keep talking until I am pulled up. It has been suggested to me that section 26A of the Act could have been used to tax the shareholders and not just the company, although I understand that the Queen's Counsel who were approached said there were no authorities for this. Nevertheless, the Commissioner of Taxation does have some considerable powers at his disposal. It would have been possible for him to make his own judgment on that and to have assessed, or to have reassessed, under section 170, the tax that he thought was assessable. Then, having either used sections 26A or 166 and 167 to assess the shareholders, or 170 to reassess them, he could have used section 201 to collect the tax assessed notwithstanding that there was or may have been an appeal pending.

        It would seem to me that if those methods were available to the Commissioner of Taxation in the years 1973 to 1982 we need to ask some questions about why they were not used and why the retrospective legislation was introduced. I would appreciate from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) or the officials of the Attorney-General's Department some more learned opinions than those which I have been able to get my hands on, as to why section 26A was not made applicable to the shareholders, not just to the company and why sections 166, 167, 170 and 201 were not used with all the powers that the Commissioner had at his disposal in the past decade.

I wonder why the Department did not seek similar advice with regard to the applicability of sections 166 and 167 and the other sections which I have mentioned. Surely this would have been within the brief of the Attorney- General's Department or the Crown Solicitor's Office.

        (1) Has an inter-departmental inquiry regarding the needs to be met to enable Horn Island to develop as a satellite township to Thursday Island been completed ?

       <para>
        I ask whether the Government could provide an answer in due course about some of the matters in that question-namely, which are the two Commonwealth Government departments involved in the answer to questions (2) and (3), what discussions are going on between the Administrator of the Torres Shire Council and Commonwealth Government departments and why are those discussions being carried out and what are the certain facilities mentioned in the answer to question (5) and what will happen to those certain facilities once these discussions have been carried out? I am aware that those questions cannot be answered this evening but I hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) can take them back to the relevant Minister. I am not too sure who the relevant Minister is; perhaps it is the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) who represents the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Perhaps the questions could be passed on and answers given whenever possible.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. In giving effect to its 1981-82 staff ceiling my Department found it necessary to reduce the staffing of the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) by 6. Because of the need to give priority to those areas of NAL involved in the provision of hearing aids to eligible members of the public, it was decided to discontinue certain work undertaken for other Government Departments by the Applied Noise Research Group, and to reduce its staffing accordingly.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. The reduction in staff ceiling applied to NAL was determined before the ASTEC Report was made public and prior to the independent enquiry mentioned because these were not considered relevant to the decision. The report of the enquiry is still to be released. It was necessary for my Department to reduce to its approved 1981-82 staff ceiling as quickly as possible and staffing priorities had to be implemented promptly. To have awaited these reports would have impeded my Department's achieving its approved overall staffing level within the requested time.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes, the Applied Noise Research group has, when requested, provided a consultancy service to other Government Departments and instrumentalities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Those Departments (formerly Defence, Transport and Housing and Construction ) who were regular users of the consultancy service on noise problems have been given adequate notice of the cessation of activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Commonwealth Departments wishing to engage private acoustical consultants would be aware of the related costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No consultant services are expected to be required by my Department as a result of these changes. Therefore, no provision has been made in funds estimates.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) No. Staffing reductions had to be implemented to enable my Department to meet its staff ceiling. A cut in this area was considered to have the least adverse impact on the services provided by NAL to eligible members of the public . In the circumstances, a formal cost benefit analysis was not considered appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Consultants chosen by the Departments would be expected to be of such a calibre that their technical advice would be reliable. Senior officers of the Department concerned would assess the appropriate action on any recommendations made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Because of other work priorities there have been some delays within NAL in the testing of ear protectors.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) A report called 'Attenuation of Hearing Protectors' is published by the National Acoustic Laboratories.

       (1) The current hourly operating cost used in Government accounts for the costing of special purpose flights by the RAAF B707 aircraft is $4,215. This rate does not provide for amortisation of capital costs, aircrew or other ' overhead' charges.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Commercial airlines do not provide hourly rates for the charter of aircraft and will normally only provide cost estimates against actual flights specified. In any event, as there are no Boeing 707 aircraft commercially available within Australia, any quotes would need to include the return costs of a positioning leg.

       Mr Houghton arrived in Australia on only one occasion in 1972 without a re- entry visa. That was on 12 February 1972. The circumstances surrounding his subsequent entry to Australia on that occasion are given in my answer to Senate Question No. 2040 which appeared in the Senate Hansard of 21 September 1982.
