        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. That we wish to express our strongest opposition to any deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. That if trading hours are deregulated in the Australian Capital Territory, the present restrictions on trading hours in other parts of Australia may be lifted.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. Past performances have proven that longer trading hours do not lead to increased sales. However, they do increase costs, because shops have to be staffed for longer periods. To cover these increased costs, retailers are forced to increase prices and reduce staff levels. This means that longer trading hours increase both prices and unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. There is no real consumer demand for longer trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        5. The deregulation of trading hours would force small retail companies out of business.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. Extended trading hours would gravely disrupt weekend recreation and family life of shop assistants.

       Australian Capital Territory: Retail Trading Hours
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned respectively showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. That we wish to express our strongest opposition to any deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Past performances have proven that longer trading hours do not lead to increased sales. However, they do increase costs, because shops have to be staffed for longer periods. To cover these increased costs, retailers are forced to increase prices and reduce staff levels. This means that longer trading hours increase both prices and unemployment.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. There is no real consumer demand for longer trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The deregulation of trading hours would force small retail companies out of business.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. Extended trading hours would gravely disrupt weekend recreation and family life of shop assistants.

       Defence Service Home Loans: Ex-servicewomen
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the members of the Women's Services of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as '' Australian Soldiers'' under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required and yet are refused Defence Service Home Loans.
      </para>
      <para>
       They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave need arisen would have been used, to serve with distinction as have women of other lands.
      </para>
      <para>
       In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, while the women of the Airforce could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex- servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.

       Great Barrier Reef Marine Park

       The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage list.

As I would not have any precise figures I will refer this matter to the Treasurer who is the responsible Minister. But it seems to me that, assuming that the money is used for job creation purposes, it will, of course, generate more taxation payments.

         —Honourable senators will be aware of the existence of the National Aboriginal Education Committee which advises officers of my Department on matters relating to Aboriginal education. Its Chairman, Mr John Budby, may well be known to the honourable senator. The target of 1,000 Aboriginal teachers by 1990 was derived from within the Aboriginal community, I think by the NAEC. It is certainly one which is being promoted by the NAEC. The proposition behind that target, namely that we require a large number of Aboriginal teachers, is one that is recognised by all those who are associated with Aboriginal education and with the needs for it. Many of the initiatives that need to be taken will need to be taken through my portfolio rather than through the portfolio of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, whom I represent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        For a start, there are questions of Abstudy grants being made available to those who might be suitable and who wish to be trained as Aboriginal teachers. Representations come to me as to more appropriate benefits which might enable mature age Aboriginals with family responsibilities to take on such training. That would require further consideration by government. But to the extent that Abstudy is involved, we are trying to do what we can to make sure that that grant is available to all of those who want to take on teaching courses. Increased numbers of Aboriginal people are entering courses. Secondly, we are trying to make sure that within most of the schools that take on teacher training there is a readiness to accept Aboriginal candidates. That kind of negotiation is going on. Thirdly, in terms of people who get on to campus, we try in many places to mount what are called enclave programs-I think the honourable senator will be familiar with the way in which they operate-whereby extra support is mounted around students, particularly Aboriginal students, to try to enable them to succeed. Without picking up the particular number, I assure the honourable senator that we understand the need for Aboriginal teachers to be available and for the training system to be responsive and sensitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable senator referred particularly to bilingual teachers or teachers with capacities in more than one language. I will obtain for her the details of what we are doing in the bilingual area. This is an area of overlap with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I would want to have accurate details for her. We have something like 17 schools in the Northern Territory now offering bilingual programs. An increased training program is going on to try to get people who have bilingual capacities. I endorse the sentiment behind the honourable senator's question. I will try to obtain for her all the details of the ways in which we are trying to promote its achievement.

Is it a fact that the People for Nuclear Disarmament is a highly political organisation which has as one of its main aims a campaign against the Omega navigation station in Gippsland? In view of the recent deplorable riots at the Omega station by violent and very ill-informed people, will the Government expedite consideration of the tax status of the People for Nuclear Disarmament?

Senator Chipp's question concerned the priority and emphasis which the Government gives to mandatory second language instruction. I think the honourable senator will agree that it may not be appropriate for us to be proposing mandatory second language instruction. What I said in the speech to which the honourable senator referred at a recent conference on national language policy was that there are lots of benefits to Australia in having a polyglot community rather than a single language community and that there are many reasons why we, as a nation, should want to develop a capacity to be proficient in more than one language. I have no doubt about that. The Commonwealth does not administer or make day to day decisions in most of the education systems as the education systems in the States are run by the States. The Commonwealth administers the system in the Australian Capital Territory, which operates at a better level than most of the other systems. All we can do is to encourage the States to proceed down this road.

        To the extent that we can help to establish within the national mind the desirability of pursuing a community more competent in languages, we are anxious to do so. I think the point that was made by Mr Hodges at that conference is valid; that is that the teaching of English remains a very high priority in this country and competence in English remains probably our first priority for many people who come here. That is not to say that we would not like to see most Australians competent in a second language. The honourable senator asked another question which I cannot recall. He might tell me the second half of his question by way of interjection.

Is it a fact that President Mitterrand has been unable to restore France's ailing steel industry notwithstanding his election promises of 18 months ago? Is it a fact that Japanese steel mills have recently made cutbacks in their steel production because they are unable to compete with the more modern steel mills of Korea? Will not the development of the new Bahrain pelleting plant currently under construction for Arab iron and steel add yet another nail to the coffin of ailing outdated steel works throughout the world? With that in the background, will the Minister say whether BHP intends to use the Federal Government's accelerated depreciation allowance package to modernise its steelworks so that they can once again become world competitive, or has BHP simply decided to give the game away? Finally, will the Government ensure that BHP workers are not fooled, in the Mitterrand fashion, into believing that there is any solution in increased protection, subsidies or nationalisation as an alternative to modernisation at least to the standards of steelworks in South Korea, Taiwan and Bahrain?

We are feeling the effect in Australia-not least in my part of Australia, Western Australia-in reduced purchases of the raw materials that we normally sell. I think it is true also that the establishment of new and highly efficient steel industries in other countries changes the terms of world competition. It is true that Australian steel producers, BHP in particular, are likely to find the world market more difficult given that new and modern plants are being brought into production.

        I do not think there would be any prospect of BHP giving the game away, as mentioned by Senator Lewis. It is my understanding that BHP is about to make a submission to the Industries Assistance Commission, which may indicate its future intentions with respect to steel production in Australia, but I know of no public statement by the company yet which would indicate that it is taking advantage of the improved depreciation arrangements which were introduced by the Government earlier this year-which were seen by some, I think, specifically as a BHP benefit-and engage in further modernisation. However, I shall check that with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and see whether a more detailed reply can be provided.

       <para>
        I have little doubt that the people who work for BHP would realise that their future security of employment is dependent upon there being a competitive industry in Australia, and that any short term protection is unlikely to give them the sort of long term security for which I am sure they wish. But again, I shall ask Mr Peacock whether he wishes to make any additional comment on the matters raised by Senator Lewis.

         — As I understand it, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace issued a media release on 16 November alleging that the Australian Government had assisted the Philippine Government's alleged repression of Catholic clergy in the Philippines. The allegation was based on an assertion that a speech by the then Ambassador in Manila, Mr Woolcott, in April 1982, referred to the role of politically motivated priests in supplying information to foreign critics on Australian aid. It is alleged that this comment and subsequent media coverage of criticism by priests in the Philippines of an Australian project on the island of Samar touched off a series of violations of human rights on Samar partly directed against clergy. Regarding the allegation of a linkage between Mr Woolcott's remarks in April and the alleged campaign of repression in October-November, there is no evidence of any such connection. Criticism by the clergy of such projects as those to which Mr Woolcott referred has long been public knowledge in the Philippines. There is also no evidence that any of the recent actions by the Philippine Government is motivated simply by a desire to stifle critics of foreign aid projects.

       <para>
        I have been asked questions by other honourable senators with regard to aid to the Philippines. On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I want to make a fairly general comment. The Australian Government is always concerned about violations of human rights, wherever they occur. The Government's position on internationally accepted standards of human rights has been repeated in a number of international forums and is well known, including by the Philippines Government. Australia, bearing in mind its own national interests and the interests of the recipient country, does provide development assistance and co- operation. The granting of aid by Australia does not necessarily imply, on the part of either Australia or any recipient country, endorsement of the other's policies. This applies generally and therefore also applies in the case of the Philippines. The Australian Government does not believe it would be appropriate to link the Australian Development Assistance Program to the human rights question in the Philippines. I will have what was said yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which Senator Tate has mentioned, related to the question that has been directed to me today, to see whether the Minister wishes to make any further comment.

For example, Mr Hawke holds the view that a considerably larger deficit than is favoured by Mr Hayden would be appropriate . The Government gave an indication of the kind of deficit that it expected. Unfortunately, arising out of events subsequent to the Budget-drought relief plus the unemployment factors that have emerged-expenditure has increased. The optimum deficit is one that we can control within those limits. We put no ceiling on it because no one can measure the extent of the drought. The fact is that the drought and its extent are beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot measure precisely the amount of money that will be involved in the extension of the Budget. But we will try to keep the Budget deficit as small as we possibly can.

The idea that the States traditionally are responsible for criminal law , in the sense in which criminal law is generally understood, should not lead one to the conclusion to which Senator Crichton-Browne seems to have come that there are no significant areas of Commonwealth responsibility in which there is criminal activity. If one thinks of the fields of taxation or Customs, one immediately thinks of a couple of fertile fields in which organised crime can flourish. Nobody could look at the reports which have been coming down for 10 years, which show not just episodic crime which occurs when somebody is a naughty boy, but crime which occurs on a broad basis by people scheming to defraud the whole community; nobody could look at the lack of action which has occurred among State police forces with respect to organised crime; and nobody could look at chapter 10 of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, which was tabled in this place and which talked about the scope of organised crime and the inability of the State police forces to come to grips with it, without being deeply disturbed.

        When significant areas of Commonwealth responsibility are involved and significant areas of Commonwealth law can be flouted by organised crime, I do not believe it is possible for the Commonwealth simply to stand back and say that organised crime is a matter which is fundamentally one of State responsibility. The Commonwealth has made clear that it wishes to enter into this matter on a co-operative basis with the States but that it believes that a crimes commission is needed. In those circumstances, of course co-operation is a two-way process. We have legislation which will be debated in this place shortly which permits co-operative action between the Commonwealth and the States. If that co-operation is not forthcoming-indeed, we hope and expect that it will be- it provides for a commission which can deal with those areas of specific Commonwealth responsibility. In other words, the Commission would be charged with looking merely at those areas of Commonwealth law which might be flouted by organised crime.

        I think this matter is of general public concern. We should come to grips with something which successive reports, culminating in the Costigan report, have shown us do exist in our community. I hope that the States will see fit to pick up the opportunity for co-operation with the Commonwealth which exists in this area.

As I tried to make clear in my answer, however, if that co-operation is not forthcoming then the Commonwealth will remain resolute in its wish to come to grips with organised crime which affects areas of clear Commonwealth responsibility. With regard to the co-operative arrangements which were being discussed at the meetings in September, the fact is that the States had a quite separate proposition which involved the strengthening of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, a body which has been established for some time and which already operates on a co-operative Commonwealth-State basis. As was made clear to the States when the Commonwealth indicated in October that it intended to proceed with the establishment of the National Crimes Commission, the Commonwealth is still prepared to see the criminal intelligence arrangements strengthened in the way which is wanted by the States. There is no barrier at all to the continued development of that further co-operative effort to increase both Commonwealth and State resources in the attack on organised crime.

         —Senator McLaren has asked two separate questions. It so happens that in the course of last year the wage upsurge-it caused the devastation which we now face-was something like 17 per cent to 18 per cent. It is because of that upsurge that a wage freeze is necessary. The fact is that it is now that the visible impact of those wage increases is causing the shedding of employment in companies and, of course, threatening future jobs that it is necessary to act. I would have thought that that was clear. The Government parties in 1974 made clear throughout Australia their views in opposing the referendum of that time. Those views are well known. They were reflected very strongly in the ballot box by the people. I have no doubt that that support is similar to the support that the people would have for that proposal today. The sovereign powers with respect to prices lie with the States. The States have the power to act if they so desire.

The precise conditions are not a matter which I have clearly enough in my memory to hazard a guess at. I will bring further information to the Senate in response to the honourable senator's question. The general concern is that the arrangements for the employment of CSDOs should be such that they are engaged in productive work which will improve access to children's services and in appropriate areas improve the supply of subsidised places.

In view of the importance of local government payrolls to communities in country towns, is the Minister aware that there is great concern in those areas that the Government's proposal will have a serious deleterious effect on the economies of those towns, particularly in view of the critical drought situation that exists in New South Wales and its consequential effect on the economies of country areas, to which Senator Sibraa and I can testify from our inspection of certain rural areas in our State last weekend?

Of course, because of the Government's understanding of the position, it has embarked on a very widespread, I think unprecedented, support for drought relief to the extent that it is envisaged that there should be perhaps some $350m for drought relief made available. That of course would help to offset the hardships in those places. I have not the precise breakup of the $700m. I will seek that for the honourable senator. The fact is that the aim not only with the saving of the $700m but also with savings in commerce and industry throughout the community is to recycle the money to provide further employment opportunities for people and therefore to offset the drought effect. It is not intended to reduce the volume of money in the community at all. The intent is to keep the money recycled and to provide for more employment than if wage rises were to persist. There ought to be no fall-off at all in purchasing power; on the contrary, it should be maintained.

        I remind Senator Primmer that the Committee found on scientific evidence that no nuclear submarine would ever navigate by Omega because, as a result of electrical storms and solar flares, it could be totally inaccurate. Indeed, he will be reminded that a great deal of the time of that Committee was spent on determining that submarines carrying ballistic missiles navigate both by their submarine inertial navigation systems and by using transit satellites. Fundamentally and essentially that Committee found that there is no way at all in which Omega would be used in a military sense, that those who sought to use it in a military sense would be using a very inaccurate and unreliable mechanism , and that it is good for commercial navigation.

        I can only say that those who are leading the anti-Omega movement are misleading the public.

The only matter the Government is directing itself to at the moment is what are called black holes in the exploration sense. There are classifications of small, medium and large fields and a different levy is charged on each. There is a problem when a well produces more than, shall we say , two million barrels and gets into a higher payment category. Contrary to the newspaper story, the Government did not take the initiative on this. The producers have asked the government whether it will look to this question of what are called black holes in the jargon of the exploration and development trade so that they can have charges which would not penalise them should they move from, shall we say, a small field to a middle-sized field or from a middle sized field to a large field. This is under review at the moment. In any attempt to do that, whatever happens, the Government will seek to get from the producers in those fields only the same amount of money as it gets today. We do not at this moment have anything else under review.

         —I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to an article by Mr Arthur Faulkner and Mr Des Storer which appeared in a recent addition of Migrant Action and which related to the evaluation undertaken by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs of the report of the Galbally Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants. Will the Minister comment on the claims by Mr Faulkner and Mr Storer that if a substantial piece of research conducted by the Institute to support its evaluation-namely, the survey of information, needs and use of services-is as described, there is probably no other comparable study in this area and that, if published, it would possibly be more significant than the evaluation itself? In view of the significance of this survey, which was a sample of some 1,760 non -English speaking migrants in areas of Sydney and Melbourne, I ask the Minister: Firstly, why has the survey not been published; and, secondly, will the survey of information, needs and use of services be published to enable a full and open debate on what social and welfare services are needed by migrants in Australia?

         —The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs did see the claim made by Mr Faulkner and Mr Storer with regard to the survey of information. I think the Minister's reaction to that report was that it was erroneous in some sense because the survey was only one part of the work that was done for the evaluation. The evaluation was a major and far-reaching review of the implementation of the Galbally report and it made about 89 recommendations. The Government will spend about $21m over three years as a result of the additional direct cost of the package of measures recommended.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The claim made in the article could not be sustained. The assertion made by the authors is even more surprising, given the advice provided to me by the Minister that on 31 August this year Mr Storer was given a copy of the survey questionnaire and a full briefing on the survey by the Institute and he was advised that frequency distributions of responses and detailed statistical analysis of each question would be provided. Mr Storer advised that he would write specifying what data, if any, would be required. I understand that the Institute has not subsequently received any request for data from him.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to publication, the Institute has followed the normal practice of describing the methodology of the survey referred to and relevant findings in its published report, the 'Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services'. Furthermore, the questionnaire and the additional information on the methodology and frequency distribution of responses are available on request. Access to the raw data is not provided at present as the Institute is continuing to use it, but when the analysis is complete the data will be placed in a suitable data bank with appropriate provision to ensure the confidentiality of the respondents . Until that time the Institute will meet reasonable requests for analysis of the data and the only costs will be those of the staff and the computer time involved.

Does the Federal Government consider that this will have serious ramifications for Australia in its negotiations to attempt to control the world-wide sugar glut, in particular the seven million tonnes surplus in the European Economic Community? Does the Minister not agree that Australia can hardly ask the EEC to cut back on sugar production acreage while Australia is expanding its own?

         —It is obvious from the questions one is asked in this place that there is a certain element of State bias involved in where the questions come from. Western Australian senators are likely to be very keen to see that Western Australia's right to have a sugar industry is preserved and Queensland senators are likely to be very keen to see the existing industry is preserved. The position of the Commonwealth Government is that it cannot favour one geographic area of the country over another. There is an international sugar glut at the moment; that is absolutely true. There is a supported price within Australia and a lower export price. If another industry is developed in another part of Australia difficult negotiations will be involved in establishing what export quantities and what domestic quantities will be available to the various industries in the different parts of Australia.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The situation of the sugar industry is not static. At the moment there is a world surplus and, consequently, the world price is low. That is unlikely to be a permanent state of affairs. In any event, I will ask the Minister for Primary Industry to consider the point which has been raised by the honourable senator in his question. But I do not believe that the question contains the seeds of a solution to the dispute currently going on within Australia about where we should and should not have sugar industries.

Is the Minister aware that, whilst all interested parties were invited to comment on the present Department, they have been given no opportunity to comment on the proposed reorganisation? Does the Minister not agree that it would be a matter of prudence and of courtesy for at least the representative bodies of Australia's two greatest health professions, the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Dental Association, to be invited to comment on this matter?

I imagine, though , that appropriate consultations would take place if, in fact, such arrangements were proposed. As a matter of fact, I have just had handed to me by my staff a Press statement from the Minister whom I represent in this place which could contain some information concerning management changes in the Department of Health. Of course, honourable senators would be interested in knowing that there is to be a new Director-General of Health from 1 January 1983. Mr Laurie Willett will replace Dr Howells, who will stand down at that time. It may well be that that will be an appropriate moment for Mr Carlton to examine a range of management matters. I cannot imagine that Mr Carlton would undertake such an exercise without having the consultations to which Senator MacGibbon has referred in his question.

       <para>
        Specifically in relation to the National Health and Medical Research Council, I do have a little more information. Although I have not heard anything from the Minister which would indicate what his intentions might be nor, as far as I know, has the Government considered any such proposals, I have had as a senator a number of inputs from organisations concerned that there may be changes in the offing which they would regard as disadvantageous to themselves. I have had inputs from bodies representing medical research, the medical professions, dentistry and so on which are anxious lest their role be diminished. I believe that Mr Carlton would be very much aware of, and sensitive to, these representations, and if he were proposing changes to the NH and MRC-which has, by the way, a very proud record in Australian research-he would do so only after appropriate consultation. Of course, in the end he would, I imagine, seek the advice of his colleagues in government in respect of any such arrangement.

The proposal, therefore, envisages the sitting on Friday. Because the discussions are not complete I have deferred the moving of my motion until their completion. I now notify the Senate that following its rising at the end of this week it will resume on Tuesday, 7 December, at 1.45 p.m. That means that in the ordinary cycle of three weeks next week will be a week in which the Senate will not sit. I urge upon the Senate that because of the very heavy nature of the business that is before it now it should complete as much of the work as it possibly can by the time it rises at the end of this week.

Quite frankly, we in the Labor Party are not impressed with the apparent necessity for the Senate to sit this Friday. If it is necessary, we are willing to sit next week to get through the legislation. We were surprised to hear the Leader of the Government say that he intended that the Senate should rise at the end of this week and sit the week after next. I know that Senator Sir John Carrick has made repeated statements in the last few weeks about the difficulty of getting the Government's program through. I wish to give one example of the inconsistency of the Government in this matter, an inconsistency which makes the Opposition not as impressed as he may like us to be on the subject. Listed in the draft legislative program that we have been given are many Bills which it is apparently essential to get through. There is also a group of Bills which are listed as 'Bills for passage if time permits'. I merely make the point that two of those pieces of legislation, namely, the Omega Navigation Facility Bill and the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill, were introduced in the House of Representatives some months ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). We were told at that time that they were urgent Bills.

        —No. That course of communication is on the way. I know that Senator Sir John Carrick may well have been caught short because the debate on South West Tasmania did not eventuate. The report has not been received from the Government Printer. There is no criticism of Senator Sir John Carrick for not being more definite about the statement that he just made but I think it is fair to him, to the Government, to the Senate as a whole and to Senator Harradine to give an indication of the Democrats' position on this matter. We strongly oppose sitting next Friday because we believe that there is so much business to be attended to that it will need at least another two weeks. The Senate sat, with the agreement of the Democrats and against the wishes of the Labor Party, last Friday. I do not think we could be accused of not co-operating with the Government. We believe that no good purpose would be served by sitting this Friday as well. We will be voting against sitting this Friday. We will also be voting against Senator Sir John Carrick's proposal that the Senate, at its rising this Thursday adjourn until 7 December. We believe that there is so much urgent legislation on a list which has been supplied by Sir John that it would warrant the Senate sitting during the week.

       I hate to introduce the tawdry question of party politics into such a lofty debate, but on 4 December a rather important occasion will occur in Victoria in the form of the Flinders by-election. One can understand the reluctance of the Government to sit during that week. That is not necessarily a criticism of this Government because it is a rule of thumb that while Parliament is sitting, governments lose elections and oppositions win them. Therefore I can understand the Government's reluctance to sit during that week. There will be a beautiful irony if the Parliament sits next week because the sitting on Thursday will be broadcast when under an Act of Parliament nothing political can be broadcast after midnight on the Wednesday preceding the election. Notwithstanding a private member's Bill before this Senate supported by the Democrats and the Labor Party to do away with that ridiculous ban, lots of political matter will be broadcast nationally after midnight next Wednesday.

       I reiterate and highlight the irony of the Government's list of Bills. I hold back from using the word 'hypocrisy', but one is tempted to go that far because on this paper supplied by the Government there are three categories of Bills. There are Bills listed for significant debate such as the five Bills relating to unpaid company tax, the three Bills relating to bank account debit tax, which we will be voting against, the National Crimes Commission Bill and the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill-hardly non-controversial matters-the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill and its associated Bills, the Student Assistance ( Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. The last two Bills virtually determine the funding for schools and tertiary institutions for this year. Time has to be devoted to Question Time and the Labor Party has made a general rule that there will be one matter of public importance, maybe two, a week. This side of the chamber is co-operating. Even with that co- operation it is unthinkable that all of that controversial legislation can possibly be adequately debated in the short space of four sitting days or even seven sitting days.
      </para>
      <para>
       Then we have another heading, 'Bills for Brief Debate'. Those Bills include the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill, the Northern Territory Self- Government Amendment Bill, the Asian Development Fund Bill, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill, the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill. I mention that for the interest of those who can understand the raising of money of the magnitude concerned involving only a brief debate. Then there are five Australian Capital Territory Tax Bills, the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill, three broadcasting and television Bills to come from the House of Representatives, health legislation amendments to come from the House of Representatives, and the Bounty (Berry Fruits) Bill.

        —by leave-Frankly, I am sorry that I asked the question. All that I wanted to know was whether the Senate would be sitting on Friday, because I have a number of electorate commitments on that day. Perhaps I may express an opinion as to next week. I should have thought that it is a very costly exercise to have only one House sitting if the other House is required to sit. In other words, we have been advised by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) that Mr Speaker intends to call together the House of Representatives on 8 December, and presumably that House will meet during that week and the following week. It could be suggested, of course, that if matters arising out of the Premiers Conference require legislative action, that legislation will need to be passed by the House of Representatives before it comes to this place. Therefore, it could be suggested that if we were to return on 8 December we would not be doing anything during that week until such time as the Bills came up from the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, it is entirely feasible that, for example, we could come back here on 9 December and sit on 9 and 10 December to deal with matters that come from the House of Representatives and with matters with which we need to deal but which we have not dealt with this week.

       I am opposed to sitting next week because there is no doubt that next week will be an absolutely political week. If we sit, because of the Flinders by-election, there will be political point scoring, as has been indicated, from the Opposition and the Government side. I am not interested in that aspect. Bills have to be considered. It is my view that we should not sit on Friday of this week nor should we sit next week, but that we ought to reconvene on 9 December, sit for two days and, if necessary, the following week.

When they were drafted and introduced, it was indicated, for example, by the Premier of Victoria and by the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria that they had certain attitudes towards the Bills. Those attitudes changed. It was not necessary to assert the situation. Indeed, the Bills have been passed by the House of Representatives without opposition. So, there has been a clear change in the nature of the urgency of these Bills.

       As to the pattern of sitting, it is the custom of the Senate to sit three weeks , to rise for a week and to sit again. I would be very surprised indeed if the Australian Democrats, who insisted that we should above everything stick to the normal practices as to when we meet and also look to the health of our senators, opposed our sitting this three weeks, rising next week and sitting again. That proposal makes all the sense in the world. It is the normal pattern of Government sittings. I invite the Democrats to consider that fact.

       The list of Government Business was presented to the various parties not as a definitive list but as one for discussion and one which might be altered, with some priorities perhaps being taken out of one category and put into others. There is nothing unusual in that. In each session of every year these lists are distributed to the parties. They are asked how many speakers they want on each item and whether each item would be considered as brief or as significant. Indeed, if any honourable senator from the Opposition says: 'We regard this as more significant and that as less significant' we arrange the situation. What has happened is the normal situation. The sitting pattern that I have now announced has nothing to do at all with the playing of politics. It is simply that we will have sat for three weeks at the end of this week and we will then rise for a week and sit again.

         —We are continuing the debate on the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982. In speaking to this tax recoupment legislation today I wish to voice my sincere regret about the questionable concept of retrospectivity contained in it. To me the principle of retrospectivity is wrong. Along with every other pay-as-you-earn taxpayer-there are millions of them-I condemn the use of illegal schemes to evade taxes due, but I cannot agree with the use of retrospective legislation in order to recoup moneys that the Government says were due and should have been paid. That is, for me, a matter of principle and I cannot allow principles to be relinquished for the sake of expediency. People entered into taxation arrangements in good faith. They were advised by their accountants that they were legal and, according to the law at that time, they were otherwise why do we have this present legislation?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have also heard it argued that the arrangements were illegal. If they were illegal a law must have been breached. Why were the offenders not prosecuted at that time? Current year profit schemes are included. I would like to know how something that was accepted according to the law at that time can now in retrospect be considered wrong? If the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes operated outside the limits of the law and if the Australian Taxation Office officials knew about them, why were the people concerned not brought to justice at the time? Whose fault is it? One thing we want to remember is that even if the tax was not paid to the tax man it has not been left sitting in banks. I am sure that it would have been spent, thus providing jobs and job opportunities for many people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proponents of the legislation claim fairness to the rest of the Australian people as the reason for it. One could say that that too is a very reasonable argument but do we think about fairness in other areas? People who are on average weekly earnings might wonder if fairness also applies in the case of superannuation schemes particularly those relating to members of parliament and senior public servants. A law has been invoked to enable large sums of public money to be paid to members of parliament and senior public servants and the bulk of that, of course, is not taxable. One might ask: In another sense is that not a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme? It enables a small group of people to benefit from the public purse without having to pay tax on the bulk of the money . This is legal, it was made respectable by an Act of Parliament. What about fairness in having family trusts by means of which income can be divided and less tax paid? It is not only big business that is trying to avoid tax; everyone wants to pay as little tax as possible and therefore tries to minimise the amount that has to be paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also the question of fairness in relation to the black cash economy which is flourishing in Australia. However, I point out that the Government has tried to reduce the vast amount lost to revenue through the cash economy. Despite this, many thousands of skilled tradesmen and labourers, as well as professional people, prefer to be paid in cash and so avoid tax. Is that fair to the rest of the Australian people? The evidence of widespread tax avoidance, such as we have in Australia, is to me the most damning evidence that it is the system, not the taxpayer, which stands in need of radical reform. I agree with Senator MacGibbon who said that what we need is simpler tax legislation. At one stage I suggested to a meeting at which I was speaking that I felt that the tax Acts should also be taken to the bottom of the harbour.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 12 volumes which comprise our present tax laws do not compare very favourably with the 127 pages which make up Hong Kong's ordinances and regulations. I might add that Hong Kong has a flourishing economy despite the simplicity of its tax laws. For many companies and investors the necessity to resort to tax evasion and avoidance schemes simply reflects how far they are forced to go in order to obtain a reasonable return, providing they do it within the law. People in companies pay double taxation. Firstly, they pay 46 per cent company tax and then they have to pay tax on their dividends. So for the normal investor there is very little return from the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Government should give some real thought to supporting initiative and drive in this country instead of stifling it through the crippling burden of taxation, especially double taxation. As recently as last Friday week I addressed a gathering of about 300 businessmen and women in Brisbane on the need for a complete overhaul of the tax system and the benefits of a single rate of tax. If we had a reasonable rate of tax I do not think people would feel the need to go to accountants and lawyers to see how they could minimise their taxation.

         —Legally, that is right. I have spoken about this previously in the Senate. At present, the more one works the more tax one has to pay. People these days do not seem to want to work overtime because they say that if they do the Government will take the great percentage of it in tax. Where people are willing to work extra time, the Government should give thought to reducing the amount of tax that they have to pay. The Government should also seek to have as its prime objective as low a tax rate as possible so that business can grow, develop, thrive and thus give employment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that excessive tax destroys incentive. I consider that retrospective legislation can destroy business confidence. I hope that the passing of this tax recoupment legislation will not mean the collapse of many businesses and investments and the loss of many more jobs. All the present situation is doing, with tax avoidance schemes, bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, current year profit schemes and retrospective legislation, is locking taxpayers and government in a useless, time wasting and costly struggle which is breeding a mounting attitude of hostility to both government and the law which has already harmed us all.
       </para>
       <para>
        One angle I would like to put is: If we cannot trust the law as it stands, whom or what can we trust? We must be able to rely on the law. When we ask for legal advice we must be able to believe it and feel that it will not be changed retrospectively. The ability to trust the law distinguishes our country from countries such as Russia or other communist countries where land can be taken away from people and they can be put in gaol without any worry about the law.
       </para>

        Another angle to this debate is: Is this retrospective legislation really necessary? People have already been charged under the existing legislation and the prosecutor appointed by the Government has not yet got going. I consider that there should have been some test cases under the existing legislation before the Government contemplated moving with its proposed legislation. Does the end justify the means? In recovering vast amounts of money, will the Government feel justified in opening up a Pandora's box for others to abuse indiscriminately? Let us not be naive enough to think that it could not happen. Recently in New South Wales Mr Wran and his Government talked about introducing legislation that would collect unpaid stamp duty on any transaction as far back as 1920-62 years ago. Fortunately that idea appears to have been shelved.

        There was also talk that Mr Cain and his Government in Victoria were considering a retrospective land tax. Who knows what retrospectivity might be introduced federally? What worries me is that our Government may give justification for retrospectivity. One could think, of course, about how quickly it might be abused and what might be in store for us. As a matter of fact, Senator Evans himself has said that this legislation will be only the thin end of the wedge if the Labor Party ever gets into power. He said that a Labor government would introduce more, and worse, retrospective legislation.

        There are too many aspects of this legislation with question marks. Many people say that it is badly drafted legislation and is wrong in its fundamental aim. I consider that there is a need for an innocence clause. I will be supporting this in the Committee stage. There are vendor-shareholders who dealt with purchasers who were not involved in the bottom-of-the-harbour or other fraudulent schemes and who can produce documentary or other substantive evidence that they took all reasonable steps to ensure that the law would not be breached either by themselves or by the purchaser. The subsequent actions of the purchaser proved this to be correct. The subject company also conformed to all taxation and companies Acts at all times. Unfortunately, the legislation as tabled extends to cover such innocent vendor-shareholders. I do not feel that the legislation was ever intended to be so extensive. The least the Government can do is to exempt such innocent vendor-shareholders.

         —I am reminded from time to time in the tax debate of the saying that no matter how complex an issue may be one can be sure that someone will come up with a solution which is clear, simple and wrong. I am reminded of that particularly when people suggest that the solution to the great tax evasion industry that we have in this country, in common with other countries, is a simple system of tax. I am particularly dismayed when Hong Kong is given as an example that we ought to be following. I have had the opportunity to visit Hong Kong and I know a little about it. Whilst there are many things about that colony's economy which are admirable in terms of productivity and growth, there are other things about it which I am sure we would not want to see in this country. We would certainly not want to see the lack of security in old age or in infirmity that can exist in that colony.

       <para>
        There are those who campaign for a lower rate of tax-a so-called 'flat tax'-as a solution to the problem that we face at the moment. More than once in the Senate they have given that as an example. Whilst I join with such people in their opposition to this retrospective legislation, I do not think that to prescribe Hong Kong's social standards and welfare standards is any solution at all to the situation that we face. The simple fact is that a flat rate of tax-a 20c in the dollar tax, as is suggested-means that poorer people would pay more tax or else fewer facilities would be available to deserving citizens in this country. I have had this proposition put to me many times around my electorate. Unfortunately, those who propose it to me are the same people who are likely to say how much more government assistance is necessary for export incentives; how much more money should be spent on our roads, particularly in central and northern Queensland; and how much more money should be given in benefits of one sort or another in which they are interested.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am convinced that in the context of the whole tax evasion or tax lowering debate there are people in our community, a small but vocal percentage, who just do not want to pay any tax at all. It would not matter whether tax was 20c in the dollar or 90c in the dollar; they would have the same complaint. The people who are evading paying tax now, whether they be paying 46c in the dollar or 60c in the dollar, would evade paying tax at 20c in the dollar. The simple situation is that there are in our community people who do not believe in paying tax, who believe that if they can avoid paying tax-however they may avoid it-that is a fair gain. There are people who feel no responsibility at all to pay tax. I believe it is a citizen's duty and responsibility to make a contribution of some sort, provided that he or she can afford to make one, to the mutual needs of the community whether those needs be roads, hospitals or defence forces. They are all things that the nation needs. They are all things which we should all, as citizens, be prepared to support if we possibly can.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, of course, what is so nauseous about the tax evasion debate. I, along with many others in this chamber in recent years, have felt nauseated as we have heard conversations or read claims in newspapers about how one is a mug if one pays tax and how, if one is not onto this lurk or that lurk it just serves one right. We have been asked 'Have you heard the latest one?' and 'What is the name of your tax accountant?' So this situation has gone on for years. Frankly, that is one of the reasons that I find this initiative by the Government unacceptable . We have all known for some time that the tax evasion industry was a very large and a growing one. We should in this context, however, give credit to the Government for those moves towards tax evasion which have been real.

        We are all aware also of the flat statements by those involved in taxation, particularly taxation accountants-that the initiatives of John Howard and of the Fraser Government have virtually stamped out tax evasion in this country. The sadness of the situation we find ourselves in now is that action that should have been taken several years ago in relation to this instance-the bottom-of-the -harbour schemes-was not effectively taken at the time. Therefore, we are faced with the odious business of establishing retrospective taxation legislation. It is odious. It has been an unsavoury debate, which has now been going on for several months in one way or another.
       </para>
       <para>
        I personally have not publicly entered the debate until this moment. When I was pressed, some months ago, by certain people to state my position in relation to the legislation I refused to state a position because I wanted to see what Bill I would actually be voting on when I was finally required to indicate what my position was. I hoped, as many others did, that there would be some modification of the legislation, that the legislation would not be so extreme. But the situation has been inflamed in a variety of ways. It has not been helped by certain newspaper editorials which have stated that anybody in Parliament who opposes the retrospective tax legislation cannot avoid what the newspaper editorials claim is a condoning of tax evasion, avoidance, cheating-call it whatever you like-people trying to get out of paying the tax that they should pay on the incomes that they are receiving. I utterly reject that allegation.

       <para>
        I, as I have already indicated, am someone who firmly believes it is a citizen' s duty to make his or her contribution through tax in its various forms to the welfare of the general community. We can debate the degree of need but I do not accept that anyone can avoid saying that we have a mutual responsibility to our nation in that area. However, it is a giant step to say that any form of tax recoupment or collection is therefore justified if it is aimed at catching up with those who have had some advantage in the past. Any method is not justified. I think this legislation will bring about a chaotic situation at a time, frankly , when the nation really cannot afford it in some areas.

        I do not condone the fact that it is alleged that the Gold Coast building boom is due, at least in part, to money that was evaded through these bottom-of-the- harbour schemes. It seems to me, in my basic approach to taxation legislation, that the genuine bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, the destruction of company records as a means to avoid paying tax, must surely be illegal and must surely have been illegal. There are some opinions that indicate that it has been believed to be illegal, but action has not been taken. It is not good enough for me-much as it pains me to criticise my own Government on this issue-when it can be claimed that this legislation is an attempt to avoid the issue of whether there was administrative incompetence, at whatever level, and that both the Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department did not act several years ago on bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It pains me that that is a possibility and that this wretched legislation is the alternative that we face.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has further been an unsavoury debate by the way the whole matter of tax evasion has been treated in Parliament in recent weeks. Make no mistake about it , the Australian Labor Party has blood in its nostrils on this subject. I listened to the debate in the House of Representatives. Lively as the debate was , many of the things said were absolutely unworthy of the honourable members who said them. The ALP has been at pains to paint the Fraser Government as a government which condones tax evasion. I have already said that I do not think that claim can be justified on any grounds. I think the Fraser Government has tried very hard to stop tax evasion in certain areas. However, I think that either the Government or its administrators-its servants-fell down on the job in relation to this type of tax evasion. We have all been reading for several years in the newspapers about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and what was happening with them. I can recall reading about them in detail for at least two years in certain newspapers. I must say the reason they stuck in my mind at first was that it was a puzzlement as to how on earth people could get away with them. I spent some time two or three years ago, when the existence of these schemes was being alleged in newspapers, trying to sort out how they could possibly work and how people could avoid the arm of the law. However, they did work and this is the solution we are offered.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent weeks in debates in the Senate and in the other place the Labor Party has been beside itself with glee over certain revelations in relation to taxation avoidance. It has not attempted to treat the issue of tax evasion as anything other than an embarrassment to the Government, particularly in the light of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. That has not been a constructive debate; it has been a destructive one. It is my impression that many members of the Australian community are fed up to the teeth with the character assassination and the misuse of this chamber that has been part of the tax debate. It seems that I am not the only person prepared to put this view on record. I will quote from the 'Bishop's Newsletter' of 21 October 1982 of the Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn. The bishop gave his view on the whole tax evasion debate and retrospective taxation. I think it is a view worth putting into the record and taking some note of because the bishop who could not be claimed to be in favour of tax evasion, to be covering up for tax dodgers, or to have anything himself to hide or gain from the issue. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The tax evasion issue grinds on. If it has done nothing else, it has forced us to think a bit about moral issues in public life, and that is certainly to the good. However, like everything to do with money, when people dwell on it too much, this debate is destroying trust between human beings, and is exposing, once again, the fragility of our political life.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, tax evasion is highly undesirable. In that it is an act against others for the sake of one's own personal gain it is immoral and to be deplored. Moreover, the 'bottom of the harbour' mode is the more unsavoury because it seems to have been mainly practised by people who are financially relatively secure. 'How hard it is for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God,' said Jesus, and this whole issue seems to illuminate the saying.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet, I wonder if retrospective legislation is the way ahead. There is, to begin with, the problem of the precedent that it establishes. Is it the size of the sum lost to the state (whatever that amounts to) which leads the government to depart from established convention? If so, is it a good enough reason, and can we be sure that the motives for enacting retrospective legislation next time will be irreproachable?
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the protections of the law and the ballot box, the problem of precedent need not be taken too seriously. Of greater concern is the kind of witch-hunt to which it could lead. How much will we be bettered as a nation by the allegations , investigations and prosecutions that the legislation will authorise? How shall we manage to wait from night to night for the next enthralling episode in the TV coverage of the whole wretched business? I would be far happier if recent experience had led to some imaginative, far-ranging new legislation to deal with present and future tax evasion, with tough penalties, than to further damage the nation by trying to recover lost millions from the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, it galls me if I stop to think about it that people who could well have afforded to pay escape scot-free while I had to pay up, but that is hardly the point. The only course worth following now is to do that which will harm us all least.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is, you see, another strand in all this. It is that sins against society are as old as society itself. The only difference these days is the scale of them. In the past, as well as public obloquy when things were found out, there was the accepted spiritual machinery for repentance and absolution. Most of the time these days, the nation itself has somehow to absorb the hurts inflicted upon it, because the spiritual processes are ignored. One must wonder about society's level of tolerance: whether it can possibly withstand the tensions and pressures that retrospective legislation may well impose. Acceptance of what has been done may be much less of a burden than retribution and the quest of compensation. There is even the possibility of some national and spiritual growth in that: how good it would be if we could seize it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate the bishop's words: 'How much will we be bettered as a nation by the allegations, investigations and prosecutions that the legislation will authorise ?' One can almost imagine the salivating on the part of some people, once this legislation is passed, at the individual retribution and character assassinations which will take place.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate that I do not condone those who seek to avoid their moral obligations as citizens to pay tax. It must be said, of course, that those who have avoided tax in this manner are not the only ones to do so. Most people who have involved themselves with such vigour in this debate have shown a total reluctance to address themselves, for example, to the cash economy. Senator Gietzelt, when he spoke in the Senate last week, made a case about the proportion of total tax collections increasing for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and decreasing in the company area. These are statements of facts and nobody disputes them. But one cannot claim that all the increase in the PAYE area is because of a decrease in the company area. At the moment the cash economy is rife. Some people will work only for cash; some will work overtime only for cash ; some will work at weekends only for cash. Those people are costing us all money. Those who, through their business arrangements, have minimised their tax are not the only ones to cost the PAYE person money; those who avoid paying the tax that they should pay, in whatever form, do so also.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party has said that this legislation does not go far enough. It proclaims that retrospective legislation is its policy. I ask the Australian Labor Party to make clear to the people of Australia in the context of this debate whether, should it come to government, it will legislate retrospectively in relation to the cash economy. I also ask it to make clear whether it will legislate retrospectively in relation to capital gains. It is very clear to the nation that the Labor Party intends to extend the present capital gains provision in our taxation legislation. It has made that attitude clear for some time. If, by some mishap, the Labor Party were to come to power at some time in the future, to what point would it make capital gains tax retrospective? Would it be the time that it clearly defined its policy, the time when it alleges this became a major form of tax evasion, or the time it actually enacted the legislation? The Labor Party needs to make itself much clearer on this issue. If it did, the whole potential for the retrospective taxation muddle that will follow would become clearer to everyone.
       </para>
       <para>
        While people inside Parliament and outside are venting their indignation and expressing moral outrage at people who have avoided tax, as is covered in this legislation, it might be good for them to focus for some time on the full ramifications of this retrospective legislation. No matter how inadequate the law at a given time, I believe citizens have to know that the law they are acting under today is the law they will be prosecuted under tomorrow if their actions today are unacceptable tomorrow. If through tax investigation or any other form of investigation people's activities are called into question they have to know that if the action was committed at a time when it was legal it continues to be legal until it is declared illegal and the illegality dates only from the date of that change of heart.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are risks in this legislation. People have the right to know that they act under the certainty of the law as it exists at the time. There are risks in this legislation that innocent people will suffer. It is not good enough for honourable senators opposite and some honourable senators on this side of the chamber to sweep that aside and say that there were no innocent people. Those same newspapers which have thundered in their editorials about the retrospective taxation legislation and claim that those who oppose it are supporting tax evasion-that is quite an erroneous allegation-will be the ones who when this legislation comes into effect will be thundering about the injustices that are done to the innocents under this legislation. They will be thundering at the Government and at the Australian Taxation Office about how surviving spouses, most likely widows, and how children, offspring, of those who have died in the last 10 years who minimised their tax in this wayl have assets taken from them because of actions that they did not commit and things over which they had no control.

        The issue of retrospective tax is a serious and fundamental one about the status of our own laws, about how we in this law-making body regard the status of the laws that exist today. I will vote against the legislation. I will do so with a heavy heart. I am aware that the Government claims that this is part of its Budget legislation, but I find it totally repugnant and totally unacceptable . The innocence clause proposal which would exempt those people who did act in good faith and in innocence, without awareness of what would be the final consequences of what these bottom-of-the-harbour operators were up to, is one that I would seek to support.

It appears that we may vote tomorrow, in which case I may well be absent from the chamber and unable to indicate in the Senate record that I am opposed to this legislation, that I am prepared to vote against it, that I think, at the very least, there ought to be protection in it for innocence and that, therefore I would be prepared to vote for the innocence clause when moved in Committee. It is possible that I shall be here to vote, however it now appears unlikely. I therefore place my views on the Senate record .

        The inquiry was advertised widely in the national Press in November 1981 and attracted 746 written submissions of which 606 were received from the mainland States and Territories and 140 from Tasmania. Early in the inquiry, the Committee decided that it should first consider demand for electricity in Tasmania and the supply options available for meeting that demand. The Committee would then examine the environmental impacts of the feasible options and the effects of other types of land use, such as mining, forestry, tourism and recreation, on South West Tasmania.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee also initially decided to confine its first report to demand and supply of electricity for Tasmania and to report on the environmental, land use and Commonwealth assistance matters in a second report. The Committee therefore concentrated on demand and supply matters in the public hearings held on 17 days since 4 February 1982. However, two more topics were subsequently considered and are therefore now additionally included in this report. These were the significance of the archaeological discoveries near the Franklin river and the powers and obligations of the Commonwealth as a signatory to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation Convention on World Heritage in relation to South West Tasmania.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has not completed examining all the matters contained in its terms of reference, but it has reached certain conclusions on the matters examined. The Committee had available to it several studies on the demand for power in Tasmania, based on different methodologies and containing a wide divergence of demand projections. The Committee's consultants, McLachlan Group Pty Ltd, prepared a forecast of demand which took account of the possibility of either high or low growth in demand. For the purposes of the Committee's conclusions the Committee adopted the McLachlan Group forecast of demand. The forecast contained a demand projection within a band which widened the further into the future it went. McLachlan Group stated that there was, as well, a probability of one in four that demand would still fall outside that forecast band.
       </para>
       <para>
        The demand projections of the Hydro-Electric Commission fell just outside the upper limit of the McLachlan Group forecast band in 1990 and 1995 but were well within the band in 2000. The HEC's lower limit fell within the band in all three years. If the lower limit of the McLachlan Group's forecast band were achieved little or no additional capacity would be needed to the end of this century. It is likely that demand will actually be somewhere within the two extremes but, even if a high growth in demand eventuates, a major new generating facility would not need to be operational until the mid-1990s. The Committee therefore concludes that construction of a major option-that is, the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme, a thermal station or interconnection with Victoria-does not have to be commenced for at least three years, while still allowing the upper limit of the forecast of demand to be met.
       </para>
       <para>
        Irrespective of the length of the current recession the future economic outlook for Australia is uncertain. There may be booms, further recessions or both. A supply strategy needs to take account of this uncertainty as well as the risks attached to any development program. There is generally risk attached to the outlay of large sums of capital on major public works projects. Capital is a scarce commodity and competition for capital is increasing. It is not in the public interest if a large capital investment is not fully productive because the project is underutilised. It is therefore in the public interest to minimise the risk attached to any public project.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a period of uncertainty, the risks attached to public development projects increase. Investment decisions should therefore be directed towards flexibility to minimise those risks. This can be achieved by small increments, short construction lead times and relatively small capital outlays. Sometimes the forgoing of economies of scale in maintaining flexibility may be more desirable than running the risk of having public moneys tied up in unproductive generating capacity. The Committee decided that a supply strategy which would respond quickly to exigencies but ensure continuity of supply while minimising the risk of having substantial capital tied up in unused generating facilities is required.
       </para>
       <para>
        To commence construction of a major option at this time would be inconsistent with that strategy, and therefore the Committee proposed the following supply program:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. The construction of one or more small hydro-electric schemes which, apart from providing insurance against a shortfall in supply by a sudden and unexpected increase in demand, would alleviate some of the unemployment problems within the HEC if the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme were abandoned.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. The planning of several different minor options which then, if required, could be commenced quickly.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. Further investigation into the feasibility of thermal power and the detailed evaluation of Tasmanian coal reserves.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Further investigation into the feasibility of interconnection with Victoria with regard to the provision of power for Tasmania, the exchange of power between Tasmania and Victoria on an opportunity basis and the sharing of reserve capacity.
       </para>
       <para>
        5. Active research and development of magneto hydro dynamics, photovoltaic cells, aerogenerators and other forms of potential electricity generation.

        7. The systematic monitoring of demand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although this report deals mainly with demand for power in Tasmania and a supply strategy to meet that demand, the Committee decided to include in its consideration two additional topics which emerged during the course of the inquiry-the significance of the archaeological discoveries near the Franklin River and the Commonwealth's obligations and powers in relation to South West Tasmania. On the basis of expert evidence received, the Committee concluded that the archaeological discoveries near the Franklin River are of such international importance that they should not be inundated.

       <para>
        Although the Committee did not receive independent legal opinion on the question of the Commonwealth's powers and obligations in relation to South West Tasmania, it did receive a number of relevant submissions. It also had available to it an opinion prepared by Mr D. J. Rose of the Attorney-General's Department which was incorporated in the House of Representatives Hansard on 19 October 1982. On the evidence before it, the Committee believes that certain conclusions can reasonably be drawn and no contrary evidence has been taken by the Committee . The Commonwealth may well be obliged to act to preserve the area and has a considerable number of powers and options open to it to enable it to meet that responsibility.

       <para>
        The nomination of the Western Tasmanian Wilderness National Parks for listing on the World Heritage List was not central to the areas of this part of the inquiry or the evidence the Committee primarily called. However, the Committee has stated in its report that nothing has emerged from the inquiry which should persuade the Commonwealth Government from proceeding with the listing which involves the Government in fulfilling its obligations and responsibilities under the provisions of the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.

         —We are debating cognately the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 and associated legislation. I have no intention of delaying the passage of this legislation. However, there have been many speakers, from both sides of the House-a large number on the opposite side of the House are in fact opposing the legislation-and we feel it is important to reiterate our position. After years of presiding over what has been an unprecedented erosion of the tax base and an erosion of public and private morality in tax matters, the Government finally has decided to get back a part, a very small part, of what it and the community, and in particular pay-as-you- earn taxpayers have lost. It has done this only after public pressure has forced it, I suggest reluctantly, into action.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In 1980, the Government proudly introduced the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act which made participation in bottom-of-the-harbour or straw company schemes a criminal offence. However, those who got in before this legislation was passed were able to escape scot-free. But then we had the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union exposing the true extent of such schemes and, I believe, the true extent of the culpability of the Government and, in some cases , public servants in letting this appalling situation develop. The Australian Taxation Office was aware of the schemes as early as 1973. In late 1975 it was proposed, after much advice, that a test case be mounted. Unfortunately, those who were chosen to conduct that case, largely in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth, although the responsibility cannot just rest there, appear to have been strangely reluctant to prosecute. Other more important matters, it seems, were occupying their minds at the time. So, while the government and bureaucratic wheels ground on, tax avoidance and evasion schemes flourished in this country. They florished to such an extent that an eminent authority on taxation, Professor Russell Mathews, estimated that they cost in total as much as $7,000m per annum. Estimates vary at all sorts of levels but, whatever the estimates, they are considerable. It is the ordinary taxpayers, those caught in the pay-as-you-earn dragnet, and those honest taxpayers who pay their tax bill as necessary who have had to pay through the nose for this toleration of tax avoidance and tax evasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The unfortunate thing, I believe, is that no one in high office is to be held responsible for this breathtaking neglect and incompetence. The Solicitor- General is not to be held to account for the inaction of this office. The Treasurer (Mr Howard), it would seem, hears no evil and sees no evil. Yet it is clear from the telephone book of documents which were tabled in the Senate that the Commissioner of Taxation, amongst others, repeatedly stressed the urgent need for action in this area. Now, belatedly, some of the staggering revenue losses resulting from these schemes, particularly the straw company scheme, are to be recouped. But the legislation is such that the recoupment will be too little and too late. This scheme is only the most remarkable of an evasion and avoidance iceberg which penetrates deeply into Australian society.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party does not oppose the legislation. Indeed, the principle of retrospective tax legislation is one which we have advocated-we do not resile from it-as the only way effectively to curb such avoidance practices in this country. But there are deficiencies in the legislation which are of concern to the Labor Party and which have been detailed, particularly by Senator Walsh and Senator Evans, in this debate. Firstly, the legislation will recoup only evaded company income tax and undistributed profit tax. No attempt has been made to collect the individual income tax which would otherwise have been paid on dividends distributed to shareholders. It is suggested that this could easily involve a total tax liability of half as much again as the $580m which the Treasurer, some would say rather optimistically, hopes to recoup through this legislation. Secondly, there is no attempt to charge interest over the period between the time tax was originally evaded and the time assessments are served on shareholders and promoters. For some schemes this could go back as far as January 1972-some 10 years. In effect, the Government has made a substantial interest free loan to those who participated in such schemes, albeit indirectly. This, I suggest, can scarcely be a disincentive to further such endeavours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taking account of inflation, the schemes will have cost the revenue much more than the $580m which is sought to be recouped-some suggest as much as $1,000m in current year dollars. Even the conditions for payment after these assessments have been made have been watered down in the amended legislation. Certainly, a 20 per cent penalty tax will commence to accrue if tax is not paid within 30 days of the initial assessment, but should the shareholder decide not to contest the assessment he or she, on paying 25 per cent deposit, will be able to pay the residue in instalments over a 12-month period. This scheme provides far more generous conditions than the payment conditions that are available to ordinary taxpayers in this community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, there is the remarkable late amendment in the legislation designed, apparently, to mollify those who seek an innocence clause; that is, where companies were put into a tax avoidance scheme with a 'reasonable expectation' that that scheme would be successful and only afterwards were sent to the bottom of the harbour, the company, vendors and promoters involved are exempted from the legislation even if the avoidance scheme failed. This provision, it is said, will affect some 700 of the 4,500 companies so far identified by the Taxation Office as being affected by the recoupment legislation. In fact, the Government is saying that if the Taxation Office succeeds before the courts in striking down schemes such as those of the Curran type a tax obligation will apply. But if a company has gone to the bottom of the harbour the Government will not bother to collect tax from the shareholders or promoters who benefited from the scheme. This would seem to be an anomalous situation and one which appears to protect a particular category of tax dodgers-those who made what one could call 'a legitimate pretence at dodging tax'. Such a distinction between classes of tax dodgers is a typical example of the sort of hair-splitting that we have heard on this issue. I think I should remind honourable senators again that, in May 1981, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no real difference between a person who finds an artificial loophole to slip out of tax and a person who falsely declares his income.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet, this legislation, I suggest, attempts to do precisely that. It leaves the accumulated profits strip schemes, the so-called dry Slutzkins, alone. It neglects the avoided individual income tax on accumulated profits that should have arisen under the wet Slutzkins or bottom-of-the-harbour schemes when those profits were distributed as dividends. It excludes those schemes where some legitimate attempt at tax avoidance was made. The overall result is a much watered-down piece of legislation. Only a fraction of the moneys which have dissipated through these schemes will ever be collected. Some of the rich hustlers will continue to wax fat. The tragedy is that the ordinary workers and PAYE taxpayers in the community will, in fact, continue to bear the burden.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is an interesting reflection on the priorities of this Parliament, on the media and, indeed, on large sections of our community that, in this debate, there are 22 speakers, most of them from the Government side. There have been endless words in the Press and a very expensive campaign has been waged in all the advertising media in this country against the legislation and against attempts to recoup, under these circumstances, tax which should have legitimately been paid. This legislation has been watered down to the extent of the hair-splitting between what is considered evasion and what is considered avoidance. This has been the final outcome of this legislation. I suggest that if only such interest and effort were aimed at overcoming the problems of poverty and the disadvantaged, and at debating such problems, the country would be a lot better off. But the tragedy is that the people at whom this legislation is directed are a small group of the many who, by their artificial and illegal attacks on the revenue, not only make things worse for the PAYE taxpayers and other honest taxpayers, who include some of the low income people, but also make it difficult for governments of any persuasion to get sufficient revenue to redress some of the inequities in our society if they seek to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that some, but not all, of those who oppose the legislation do so for proper motives. Senator Hill, for instance, in a thoughtful speech, came to the conclusion that he should oppose the legislation because he believed, when weighing up the pros and cons, that the application of retrospectivity was wrong , certainly in this case, and, secondly, that legislation was not necessary in light of the Crimes Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act, and the powers already available in other legislation. Senator Hill, unlike some other honourable senators, did not make the extraordinary statement that the Liberal Party was against all retrospective taxation as a matter of principle and therefore that that was grounds on which he was opposing the legislation. I am glad that he did not do so, because I think that those who make that sort of remark should go to the Age of 22 November, yesterday, which reports that the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Victorian Upper House, Mr Hunt, in a debate on this sort of general principle, said that in 21 years in Parliament he-
       </para>
       <para>
        had supported more than 150 pieces of retrospective legislation with a clear conscience.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        If anyone tells me that is not Liberal, or contrary to principle, I say that we don't belong to the same party. It's nonsense to create an overall principle where none exists.
       </para>
       <para>
        I concede that Senator Hill did not fall into that trap, but we have heard that from other speakers on the Government side who oppose this legislation. But most in this Parliament clearly do not agree with Senator Hill, Senator Martin and others who came to the decision that the retrospective aspects of this legislation were, on balance, wrong. I believe that most of us do not do so because the legislation is what it says it is-recoupment legislation. It aims at recouping tax evaded through patently artificial schemes. We believe that it should aim at recouping tax avoided through patently artificial avoidance schemes. It imposes no penalty in the true sense of that word but provides for recoupment of what, in any sense of the term, should fairly have been paid. It gives time to repay and it provides a let-out clause for a large group of people who clearly, in the Opposition's view, should not have been let out but who clearly the Government, under pressure, has decided to let out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those of us who deal with social security matters know that pensioners and beneficiaries who are overpaid, either through innocent misunderstanding of the regulations on their part or through mistakes by the Department, have those overpayments recouped under the legislation as it exists now. There is and has been no hue and cry on their behalf by those who oppose this legislation. There is no expensive, organised campaign. But the the situation is analogous and I think that it should be brought up, as Senator Walsh and others have brought it up in this debate. Certainly there are under existing legislation, provisions to take action against some of these tax evaders. Certainly there was as Senator Hill pointed out opportunity for the Government to take legislative action before this.
       </para>
       <para>
        If such action had been taken, we know that it would have had a salutary effect on the burgeoning tax avoidance and evasion industry. We know that action was to be taken in the courts in 1975 but was not proceeded with as a result of the extraordinary behaviour in the Crown Solicitor's Office. Mr Costigan makes that clear. As I have said, we know from the documents produced in this place that the Commissioner of Taxation, with an increasing sense of urgency, urged that action be taken. That it was not taken is a reflection not only on the Crown Solicitor's Office but also on the Treasurer. Nowhere are there more condemnatory words about what happened in that situation than those of the Treasurer, when he stated that among the reasons action was not taken earlier was that there was insufficient public concern and expression of it. The role of government when that sort of thing is brought to its attention is to act, and act promptly.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the practicalities of the matter are that to proceed under available legislation would be uncertain, tortuous, enormously expensive and time- consuming, and would not necessarily result in justice and equity now that the gate has been left open for so long, now that the companies have been reduced to shells, now that some of them have disappeared beneath the waters. What this debate is about, as those who have supported the legislation have repeatedly said, is justice and equity for the vast majority of the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and other honest taxpayers. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, this legislation does not go far enough towards achieving that. Hence our second reading amendment and our later amendments at the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        If, in fact, we are to have some sense of equity and justice in the taxation system in this country and some morality in the distribution of the wealth of this community, unfortunately, because of past actions by many people, this legislation has become necessary. It is for that reason that the Australian Labor Party and I support the legislation to the extent that we do. We are disappointed that it does not go further. We will try to amend it to make it go further but at least it is a step in the right direction, a small step though that may be.

         —This debate is slowly wending its weary way towards its predestined conclusion. I do not want to add any great amount to the flood of words which has already been spoken and which will be spoken on this subject. I am speaking for two reasons. Firstly, I make clear that a large majority of Government senators support the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 and associated measures. Secondly, I want to put a few simple propositions to the Senate. The first is that this Parliament clearly has the power, if it so chooses, to legislate retrospectively. There can be no doubt about that. We have the power and we have used it repeatedly. We have used it for instance, many times without protest, with regard to benefits. The fact that there was no protest there was very reasonable. We used our powers very often with regard to retrospective taxation legislation. Every time we change company tax the legislation is, in fact, retrospective. A change in company tax applies to the previous year's profits. There is no outcry about that. It is accepted, but that is and we must understand that it is retrospective tax legislation. This Parliament has also legislated retrospectively with regard to criminal acts . In 1915 an amendment was made to the Crimes Act with retrospective effect. I very much doubt whether any retrospective Act on criminal matters would pass this Parliament now. I certainly very much doubt that I would support such a decision. Nevertheless, if Parliament so chooses, in appropriate circumstances, it does have the power to act retrospectively. In other areas-not criminal matters-this Parliament should pass legislation which is retrospective only when a very clear need has been made out. In this case I think the need has been made out. One of the most important principles we must consider as a Parliament is the principle of fairness in taxation, fairness in administration and fairness in legislation. Mr Justice Isaacs, many years ago, summed up this problem for us very clearly. He said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What may seem unjust when regarded from the standpoint of one person affected may be absolutely just when a broad view is taken of all who are affected. There is no remedial Act which does not affect some vested right, but, when contemplated in its total effect, justice may be overwhelmingly on the other side.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this case there has been much talk of the innocent when, in my view, the innocent in this situation have been those taxpayers-principally pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-who have been paying their income tax, perhaps reluctantly, but honestly. The guilty-I am not talking in legal terms-are those who have been paying no tax at all through artificial avoidance schemes. The innocent in this situation are the people who have been genuinely and honestly paying their tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been various suggestions that perhaps we should have dealt with other types of artificial avoidance schemes but the key element in this one is that there was fraud somewhere in the chain. This fraud, this stripping of companies of their assets so they are unable to pay their debt to the Commissioner of Taxation, has always been illegal. The 1980 Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act did not really create a new offence. It only made that offence easier to prosecute. What it was dealing with was always illegal and always fraudalent. Let there be no confusion at all about that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chipp asked the question and I think it must be answered: Why do we not prosecute these people under the existing law, the law in particular that existed prior to 1980? There are two problems about this. The first is that the prosecutions before 1980-for acts committed before 1980-would have to be for conspiracy, either under the Crimes Act, or perhaps under the Companies Act. In either case the prosecutions would be expensive, complex and uncertain. We have seen recent cases of prosecutions under the Crimes Act involving millions of dollars and no convictions. To embark on that course would be a very expensive and probably wasteful exercise.

         —If it had been successful then it would have. I do not want to get on to the area, which I must concede is one of very great sensitivity for us as a government, as to why we did not take action in 1976. I think we should have. In the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union we heard the various reasons why we did not do so, but I am trying to deal with what the situation is now. The prosecutions were not launched in 1975 or 1976. I wish that they had been but to launch them now, using the Crimes Act would be a very cumbersome and difficult exercise, the main beneficiaries of which would be the lawyers. Even if we did prosecute-we would be prosecuting the promoters, by the way-we would not get our money back because the main beneficiaries, the people who have the money, have not committed a fraudulent act. They are the shareholders. Even if we were to pursue this course we still would not get back the very large amount of money of which the community has been defrauded. For those reasons these Bills are necessary.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In this case we are going after the vendor-shareholders; the people who got the money. All they are being asked to do in this legislation is to give back money that they should never have had. We are, very properly, by an amendment introduced after the legislation was originally drafted, also going after the promoters to make them repay a fair share of the amount of which the community has been defrauded. In this legislation there is no question of guilt or innocence. No one is being convicted of anything. There are no penalties. If the vendor-shareholders pay up there will be no publicity although I see a proposed amendment which suggests that their names should be publicised. I do not think that this is appropriate. If the vendors pay back to the community the amounts that they should never have had that will be the end of the matter; if they like to fight it, of course, there will be publicity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Morally these vendor-shareholders are like people who buy an expensive watch for $10 in a pub. Perhaps they get an argument that it is a good buy. Perhaps they get someone to examine it and tell them that it is an excellent deal or deliberately, perhaps, they ask no questions at all. Whichever course of action they take it does not give them the title to that watch against the true owner. In this case the true owner of this money is the community. Morally and, now under this legislation, legally they will have to pay the money back.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one further advantage that has not been mentioned very much in this debate but I think it is an important one. We are dealing with a very difficult area of public morality where there has been a gross degradation in recent years of the willingness of people to pay their taxes. I am sure that many of us have sat around a table, sometimes in silent outrage and sometimes in noisy rebuke of rich people who say that paying tax is optional. This is an outrageous statement for them to make but it has been made many times in recent years. There has been a substantial and very important change in community attitudes to tax avoidance. I think it is good. But what this legislation does is serve as a warning to people not to get involved in questionable schemes in the future. Therefore I hope that this legislation will not only deal with the past schemes-the bottom- of-the-harbour schemes-but also make it much less likely that people will in the future get involved in such questionable schemes. Therefore, I support this legislation and will vote against all amendments to it.

         —As my colleague Senator Hamer just said, a flood of words has emanated during this debate on these taxation Bills. I just want to make it quite clear at the outset that I will not, nor will I ever, support what I term and what I understand is a retrospective law. As I understand it, and I have listened to numbers of speakers in this debate, it appears that a law existed but some people either avoided their responsibility to pay tax or went through a phase of evading tax. Those people should have been dealt with under that law. If there was not such a law and if they did not break a law at the time, I do not believe that now, 10 years later, we can introduce a law which will be retrospective to 10 years ago.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also want to make it quite clear that I have no truck whatsoever with people who break the law. I have no truck with people who will not accept their responsibilities to this country, to this nation as a whole, and make their contributions as most other people have to do. Of course, there are people who do not have the opportunity to minimise their tax in any fraudulent way because they, like myself-I have done so all my life-have to pay taxes as they earn their income. I have no escape route, as some of these people had, to avoid paying tax and living up to my responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that it was wrong for them to do what they did. If such a law was in existence at that time, they should have been taken before the courts and made to pay their fair share of taxes. If that law still exists, I believe we should be using it. If no such law existed and those people did not break the law at that time, I believe that they still should have paid their taxes. They did something that was immoral. Okay; so let us introduce a law effective from now to ensure that those people can never again evade taxes as they did in the past. But if there was a law in existence, that law should be used to bring them to justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that I have a right to support legislation that deals with people's moral codes. If people want to act immorally, I will not introduce legislation to say that they should not act immorally. That is entirely up to them and their consciences. If they want to do something that they know is immoral, and they persist in doing it, it is on their consciences-not mine. I am here as a legislator, as a law-maker, but a law-maker in the sense that the law must be made now and acted upon from now-not made retrospective to 10 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I understand it, the period from 1972, the date to which this law is to be made retrospective, to the present covers the terms of three governments which would have had knowledge that this type of thing was happening. In fact, it covers the terms of more than three governments; it covers the terms of the McMahon Government, two Whitlam governments and three or four Fraser governments . There was knowledge that this was going on but it appears that none of those governments did anything about it. Now the Government has decided to do something about it. The way it is going about it is to make legislation retrospective to 1972. I have no intention of supporting that. I certainly will vote for the innocence clause proposal. If that is defeated, I certainly will not vote for this retrospective law dealing with bottom-of-the-harbour schemes or whatever one likes to call them. I will have no part of it. I want to make my position clear. I will not support it. I have talked to many people, not only in my State but also in other States. I have talked to people from all walks of life. Very few people indeed have told me that they would support this kind of legislation. Therefore, I say again that I do not support this legislation. I certainly will be voting against it.

         —This legislation provides for the payment into the Commonwealth public revenues of moneys equivalent to unpaid company tax assessed and payable but which is unrecoverable from the company concerned due to that company being stripped of its assets and most of its records being dumped, in many instances literally, in the bottom of Sydney Harbour. I support this legislation though not without considerable misgivings and some questioning which I have tried to settle before coming to that decision. I support the legislation as it has emerged in this chamber but subject, of course, to the reservations expressed in the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition by Senator Peter Walsh. Before commencing my own contribution to the debate may I say that I feel that the way in which the Senate has conducted its consideration of these Bills is a tribute to the Senate. Many contributions have been made covering the full gamut of opinion. They have all been very well thought out and all of them, in my view, have been genuine and sincere.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do support this package of Bills which seek, as I understand it, to recoup tax which is legally payable. There is a legal liability to company tax which is assessed and due but that liability cannot be attached to any individual person at the moment without the aid of this legislation. To that extent it is true to say that this legislation is retrospective. It genuinely attaches a liability to pay moneys to persons who otherwise would not have expected to pay moneys to the Commonwealth public revenues, namely, the vendor-shareholders and promoters of the schemes involved. It is true that there is a liability to pay tax. It is undoubtedly true that, insofar as profits were earned during the year's activities, in relation to that company's profits, there is always an expected, a certain, attaching of legal consequences to the activity of earning those company profits. The law is quite definite and certain. Forty-six dollars out of every $100 of current year profits were payable to the Federal revenue. It is not as though we are creating a new legal liability in the sense of unexpectedly attaching tax consequences at the rate of $46 in the $100 to the activity of earning company profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is new and what is retrospective is that this legislation decides to attach liability to pay that company tax to those who benefited from certain arrangements which made it impossible to recover the tax from the company concerned. This law attaches liability to the vendor-shareholders and to the promoters. The question that faces us is whether that attaching of liability to those vendor-shareholders and promoters is intolerable and unjust in a society which generally seeks to achieve its social ends involving government by the raising of revenue through tax laws which are fair and certain. I may say in passing that certainty is an argument that cuts both ways. The taxpayer is entitled to certainty. Certainly the Government in those years from 1972 to 1980 , until the passage of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, was entitled to certainty in arranging its affairs on the basis of an expected revenue from company profits. It could have been expected from a gauge being made of economic activity and business enterprise activity within the economy that certain moneys would flow to the Federal Treasury in order to discharge the matters for which government is responsible such as defence, social security, health and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reasonable projections on the scale of corporate activity and its profitability are made year by year by the Federal Government and it sets its tax scales accordingly. The activities of the promoters of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes meant that those programs were placed in jeopardy, that many pay-as-you-earn taxpayers had to pay higher rates than they would otherwise have done, that the deficit at times was larger than anticipated and, therefore, borrowings of Government, with all their impact on interest rates and so on, had to be undertaken. All this was because the certainty of payment of company tax legally due was frustrated and hindered by those who sought advantage in these schemes. For those people to speak of certainty invites the rejoinder that there is also an entitlement in government to certainty in relation to its raising of revenue. The community has a right to certainty in its revenue also. Insofar as this legislation seeks to ensure that the due moneys flow to Treasury, though belatedly, then I suppose that it could be said that it helps to fulfil that early predicability and certainty which, as I say, has been frustrated by these schemes. But that is only in passing. It remains true that neither the vendor- shareholders nor the promoters of these schemes would have expected to be made personally liable for the payment of this company tax. The question is: Is it fair that they should be made so liable?
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it ought to be made very clear what the legislation does not do retrospectively. It does not impose a criminal penalty retrospectively-that is, it does not attach the stigma of criminal conviction to a person in respect of activities innocent of any criminality, say, three, five, or eight years ago. If , indeed, there were any criminal intent to defraud the revenue that would be a different matter and would be covered by the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, as many speakers have said. There would be a question of whether the promoters of these schemes had such an intent. Insofar as any vendor-shareholders were in collusion with a promoter, fully understanding the proposal to defraud the revenue, then the criminal character of the arrangements is determined then and there. Insofar as the vendor-shareholders were entirely innocent of any intent to defraud then nothing in this legislation that we are dealing with would attribute the mental elements of a crime. So, there is certainly nothing retrospective in the criminal sphere in this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an attachment of liability to pay the tax which ought to have been paid by the company. That is new and unexpected, whether one be a vendor- shareholder or promoter, and is, as I say, genuinely retrospective. To that extent, misgivings and certain caution are required. I believe that general common law tradition envisages that in specific instances this can be regarded as a fair impost on those concerned. I think, actually, the editorial writer in the Australian Financial Review of 17 August this year expressed my view when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        But non-retrospectivity of the tax law is by no stretch of the imagination an absolute moral or political value . . . . Clearly, retrospectivity is more a serious issue with respect to criminal law than with respect to income tax law.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have already said, this legislation is not retrospective criminal law; it is merely retrospective taxation law. The writer of the Australian Financial Review editorial went on to conclude:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the bottom of the harbour schemes the abuse of the tax system and the injustice is so gross that justice and fairness are on the side of retrospectivity. But the opponents of retrospectivity rightly warn of the dangers of taking it lightly. It should almost never be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        I certainly do not take the retrospective aspect of this legislation lightly but I do find some reassurance in the words of Lord Greene. Lord Greene was the custodian of the common law tradition in England, being the Master of the Rolls in the 1940s. In 1941, in a Court of Appeal decision where Lord Greene spoke for himself and Lord Justices Clauson and du Parcq on a taxation case, he had this to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact that the section has to some extent a retroactive effect again appears to us-
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom and the Master of the Rolls, the custodian of the common law tradition, speaking-
       </para>
       <para>
        of no importance when it is realised that the legislation is a move in a long and fiercely-contested battle with individuals who well understand the rigour of the contest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely, that is the case in this particular contest going on between the legislature and those involved in taxation avoidance schemes. It is there recognised by the legal tradition to which we are the heirs that in the taxation area retroactive or retrospective legislation may be permitted. I find, contrary to the assertions of Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Hill in their otherwise excellent contributions to this debate, that in the United States, whilst it is true that there is a constitutional prohibition in Article 1, section 9, against expost facto laws, it is nevertheless also true that the Supreme Court has since 1798-that is, over 100 years before this Federation was formed-decided that that constitutional prohibition should be confined to laws imposing punishment, penal laws. In fact, the United States practice is to permit retroactive legislation in regard to tax matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking of the United States practice-we are there speaking of the exemplar of a free economy where personal liberty from the exactions of government is highly prized-there is much greater discretion given to the taxation commissioner in respect of retroactive legislation than should ever be permitted in Australia. Thus, in section 7805 of the United States Internal Revenue Code it is provided:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Secretary-
       </para>
       <para>
        He is the equivalent of our Commissioner of Taxation-
       </para>
       <para>
        may prescribe the extent, if any, to which any ruling or regulation, relating to the internal revenue laws, shall be applied without retroactive effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, although it is couched in negative terms, that section gives the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States the power to decide the retrospective impact of any ruling or regulation in internal revenue matters. I am not for one moment suggesting that that fearsome, disruptive power ought to be given to a non-elected official, even one of the status of the Commissioner of Taxation. If there is to be retroactive legislation it ought to be by a clear, specific, case by case decision of the two chambers of this elected Parliament. Nevertheless, I point out that in both the United Kingdom and the United States there is recognised, by the legislatures and the courts, a place for retrospective legislation in the taxation area. I think that ought to settle some of the misgivings-certainly it helped to settle my misgivings-concerning the retrospective character of this legislation.

         —A penalty would be some additional criminal stigma being attached to the vendor-shareholder or the promoter by way of either a term of imprisonment or some actual fine which is additional to the moneys equivalent to company tax which have not flowed to the Treasury because of the scheme entered into. I would say that quite clearly the common law tradition and the United States constitutional prohibition would argue against such a penalty being imposed, but both traditions do permit retrospective tax legislation of the character before us. Nevertheless we, as Australian elected representatives, are called upon to decide whether the vendor-shareholders or the promoters of these schemes ought to pay into the Treasury moneys equivalent to the company tax evaded.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The argument that they ought to is fairly clear because both parties have benefited and had available to them to dispose of or invest over a period moneys which could otherwise have been available for community purposes as determined by the Government. Therefore, I believe it is fair that they be required now to make those moneys available to the community. It is money of which they have had the use for no less than two years, accepting that the Crimes (Taxation Offences ) Act of 1980 has wiped out this practice. Maybe they have had the use of the money for up to five years or seven years. The community is seeking the money in numbers of dollars, which takes no account of the ravages of inflation, whereas the vendor-promoter may well have used the money as a hedge against inflation, particularly in investments where no capital gains tax applies. One can expect that the vendor-shareholder or promoter will have made some investment in a business or enterprise which has returned the money at least keeping up with inflation and no doubt doing somewhat better. The legislation further gives 12 months to pay. So the closure of business, sackings or liquidation of stock at unrealistically low prices will not be forced on those who have to pay. Perhaps in that regard some distinction ought to have been made in cases where immediate payment would cause genuine hardship. I am not going to quibble with the 12 months period of grace except to say that it rather upsets the Budget prediction as to how many hundreds of millions of dollars might be recouped in this financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to more general arguments that have been raised, I do not think the scale of avoidance is relevant at all to the question of whether it is fair to attach liability to the shareholders or the promoters. In that I am in entire agreement with those who have said that they will vote against this legislation. I do not think the scale of avoidance is at all relevant to the question of whether it is fair and correct to attach liability to the vendor-shareholders or the promoters. In my view it is enough to say of the shareholder or promoter that each actually, immediately, directly and quantifiably obtained a monetary advantage by virtue of the scheme in a way directly in proportion to the non- payment of company tax. The scale of avoidance explains the Government's belated action in this regard. What truth there is in the argument of those who oppose these Bills lies in the assertion that this is a political response to the public perception that the enormity of tax avoidance activity needs to be confronted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The scale of that avoidance can be measured in two ways. It can be measured in terms of the hundreds of millions of dollars avoided. In 1981-82 I believe it was estimated that some $1,500m in tax was avoided. That money is made up by increased borrowings by the Government, with an impact on interest rates, by taxing the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, perhaps by some increased range or scale of indirect tax, or even by reduced government expenditure in some areas. That is one measurement. One can also refer to the sheer number of individuals involved in tax avoidance. The Commissioner of Taxation said that, in 1981-82, 58,366 individuals were identified as participating in these schemes. How many were not identified? That represents a thirty-threefold increase on the 1975-76 period-a mere six years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        None of that description justifies retrospective legislation. In that, the opponents of the Bills are correct. It justifies the most vigorous condemnation of a government whose procrastination in the administration and enforcement of its laws allowed the taxation avoidance industry to flourish. I refer to the documented failure to provide the Australian Taxation Office with the personnel- the sinews of war-to fight the battle. I refer also to the equally well- documented, pathetic incompetence of the Crown Solicitor's Office to mount a successful prosecution. The answer of the Government to that charge of incompetence should have been to accept ministerial responsibility for the abject failure of the departments of state which ought to have functioned effectively to protect the revenue. I do not include the Australian Taxation Office in those remarks. The Government cannot substitute this legislation for that proper political response. It boils down to this: Mr Costigan, at page 98 of his report, says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The object of tax avoidance schemes is to avoid the payment of company tax on a company by leaving only a shell of the company with no assets to pay that tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        These Bills seek to remedy that situation by looking to those who were immediately, directly and quantifiably advantaged by entering into those schemes . I think the Bills are fair in so doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question any fair-minded person might ask is whether there could be such an individual as an innocent vendor-shareholder and, if so, whether an exception to the attachment of liability should be made in that case. I think it would be true in almost every instance to say that no vendor could receive $80,000 for a company with $100,000 worth of profits, on which in the normal course $46,000 would be payable by way of tax, without knowing or deliberately remaining ignorant about the probability that a tax avoidance scheme was involved to make the transaction commercially sensible, indeed viable, for the purchaser. That would have to be the case in most instances. If the vendor were only one of many very small shareholders in a company, then there may be some doubt whether that vendor would even suspect anything untoward as he received a few dollars for his few shares. When the assessment is for a sum less than $100 this legislation does not pursue that person. The very small, genuinely innocent shareholder is not pursued. Therefore, entire innocence seems to me to be most improbable.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it may be said that the vendor, and indeed the promoter, could have been innocent in the sense that, knowing or suspecting that a tax avoidance scheme was afoot, they nevertheless assumed or were even advised that it was legal. It is not clear that the scheme was legal. Indeed, the advice of Mr Brinsden Q.C. and of many eminent counsel following him-and one suspects that there are opinions which the Government will not table in this place which would confirm the weight of legal opinion-is of the view that a criminal conspiracy to defraud was involved; that there could be civil recovery through the law of misfeasance. If that is the case, ignorance of the law, that is, of the law of conspiracy, or misfeasance in this case, is no excuse-whether such ignorance be self-induced or bought from professional advisers, lawyers or accountants.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is evident, I agree, that until the Special Prosecutor mounts a case and a court decides in favour of the Government that there is a criminal conspiracy to defraud, this view remains unendorsed by the judiciary. But, as I say, it is undoubtedly the view of many eminent counsel, of Mr Costigan and of most opponents of this Bill, that it is unnecessary to do what ought to have been done by way of prosecution in the 1970s. Thus there is, in my view, no innocent vendor-shareholder of whose circumstances the common law requires recognition. As I say, ignorance of the law-that is, innocence as to the illegality involved in making the sale as profitable as it was in the face of apparent company tax liabilities-is no excuse. Insofar as some holders of a very small number of shares-who may have been quite unaware of any element of the situation-were affected, the Bill is not concerned to pursue them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the end I hope I have demonstrated why this Bill deserves support. I hope I have answered the genuine misgivings and questions which must arise in the mind of any fair-minded person. I hope, in short, that those honourable senators and members of the public who, like me, require the fullest justification for retrospective legislation, will come to the same point as I have in wishing this Bill passage through this chamber.

         —In speaking to this package of Bills dealing with the recoupment of unpaid company tax, I think that honourable senators have two responsibilities. The first, I believe, is to deal with those in the community who have wilfully and fraudulently avoided paying tax and see that those taxes are recouped. The second is a responsibility to protect those people who are innocently involved in the matter we are discussing. The Fraser Government has done more to come to grips with tax avoidance than has any other Australian government. I can only totally agree and endorse this Government's efforts to recoup taxes that have been evaded by greedy and unscrupulous people who have created a situation whereby the rest of the community has to pay more personal taxation in order to cover the loss of revenue associated with tax avoidance. Tax avoiders are parasites on the Australian community and action to deal with such people must certainly be taken.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Since coming to office the Fraser Government has enacted a considerable number of pieces of legislation-about 30 I believe-designed to eradicate tax avoidance in many areas. Unlike the Opposition, with its new-found interest, this Government has acted over a number of years in this area. The Whitlam Government -as I have said before-laid great store on its concern about tax evasion and huffed and puffed quite a lot during the last part of its disastrous administration but did absolutely nothing. The particular form of avoidance with which we are dealing, the so-called bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, was first recognised by the Whitlam Government in 1973. This is clear from pages 27, 33 and 34 of the fourth interim report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Commissioner Costigan recounts how the schemes came to the attention of the Perth Office of the Deputy Crown Solicitor in 1973 and reports that an investigation was undertaken at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        This early detection of the schemes was also re-iterated in the response of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to the McCabe-Lafranchi report. In spite of detailed examination and on opinion by an eminent Q.C. from Western Australia, no prosecution was entered into at that time by the Attorneys-General Murphy or Enderby. The Australian community should not be fooled by the Australian Labor Party into believing that it alone is opposed to tax avoidance. The ALP's interest is new-found and does not match its record while in government. My concern about this legislation revolves around my belief that it is retrospective and the fact that innocent people will be caught up in the net envisaged by the package with which we are dealing at the moment. The retrospectivity of this measure is clearly spelt out in sub-clauses (1) and (2) of clause 5. Each of those sub-clauses in part states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a scheme entered into, whether in Australia or outside Australia, on or after 1 January 1972 and before 4 December 1980, some or all of the shares in a company were sold;
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation is clearly aimed at collecting taxes deemed due in the period between January 1972 and December 1980. The legislation will be retroactive in operation-that is, retrospectively applied. It makes laws so that those taxes can be recouped, but are those laws necessary? Mr Costigan and three Q.C.s who have provided advice to the Government over the last eight years do not think so . Since the schemes were first identified in 1973 no serious attempt has been made to collect those taxes under existing legislation. Given the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Companies Act and the Crimes Act the question must be posed as to why action has not been taken before against those involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commissioner Costigan, in his latest report, clearly identifies the legislation that could, and I believe should, have been used. Firstly, section 223 of the Income Tax Assessment Act makes it an offence not to submit a return and enables a fine to be imposed. Section 231 makes it an offence to avoid tax fraudulently and, again, a fine is incurred. Section 86 of the Crimes Act has been mentioned specifically before in this debate. That section provides that it is an offence to conspire with intent to defraud the Commonwealth. It also prescribes that it is an offence to make any attempt to defeat the operation of any Commonwealth law. The penalties provided for under this section are very severe and at least match those contained in the legislation before us at present. I remind the Senate that section 86(e) states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A person who conspires with another person . . . to defraud the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth, shall be guilty of an indictable offence.
       </para>
       <para>
        It suggests a penalty of three years. I now turn to pages 31 and 32 of the Costigan report. Commissioner Costigan states:
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to whether the scheme lent itself to criminal prosecution. It plainly does. Deliberately to denude a company of its assets so that it is unable to pay a debt is, and for a long time has been considered to be, a criminal fraud. If two or more men act together to achieve this purpose, then it is clear that they may be prosecuted at least pursuant to Section 86(e) of the Crimes Act, and probably at Common Law for cheating the Crown. If there is only one who does it without assistance, then he too may be prosecuted, though not for conspiracy but only for cheating the Crown. Should any of those men have played a part in the management of the company concerned, then they would also be liable for prosecution pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Acts.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that Costigan believes that they were liable to prosecution under those existing laws and so do three other Queen's Counsel whose opinions were sought by the Attorney-General's Department. In early 1975 Mr Brinsden, Q.C., now Justice Brinsden, firmly advised the Perth office of the Deputy Crown Solicitor that a promoter and others involved in a specific bottom-of-the- harbour scheme could be prosecuted under the Crimes Act. In July 1978 Mr Traill, Q.C. gave similar advice in respect of another specific company. Costigan also reveals that in early 1976 another opinion was obtained about a scheme involving Norfolk Island, and that opinion by a senior member of the Sydney Bar again advised that the scheme could be attacked by a criminal prosecution for conspiracy. One possible reason that this constant and firm advice was not followed could be that the Attorney-General's Department was snowed under prosecuting other cases. If this was the case, and the Costigan report's comments on the operation of that Department make me somewhat sceptical, then the Department should examine ways in which prosecutions can be farmed out to private legal practitioners. That proposition has been seriously put to me by many people in the community who believe that the Attorney-General's Department in this case has been quite negligent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that in the Government's action to crack down on tax avoidance over the past seven years much credit is due to the Australian Taxation Office which has quickly identified schemes, brought them to the attention of the Government and drafted legislation to deal with them. Unfortunately, I believe that the Tax Office has been let down by the Crown Solicitor's Office which has demonstrated a lamentable reluctance to prosecute tax avoidance cases. The failure by this Office does not, however, warrant the present legislation which will have the effect of involving many innocent people in prosecutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dangers of retrospectivity are clear. It is not conducive to proper justice to make illegal today the actions of yesterday. If this approach were adopted it could lead to many abuses upon the Australian community. As a member of the Liberal Party, I believe in and attempt to reflect the principles of that party. In our newly released platform our opposition to retrospective legislation is clearly made known. Our platform states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The rights of the taxpayer are safeguarded by minimising discretionary powers; assuring taxpayers of a fair hearing before judicial and administrative bodies; maintaining confidentiality of information; ensuring that taxation adjustments do not have retrospective effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        This very wise provision in the Liberal Party platform has been given consideration and reconsideration over a great number of years by a lot of people in the community involved with the Liberal Party who for very severe and serious reasons believe that this provision should remain. They expect us, as Liberal members of parliament, to defend that principle and not to abandon it. I believe that they have acted with a very real purpose in mind, recognising that subsequent irresponsible governments could come to power and impose retrospective taxes in many areas. It could well be that Mr Hayden's threat to bring in a capital gains tax could be dealt with in a retrospective fashion. It could well be that company taxes could be increased and made retrospective. Those are the things that I would be concerned about, those are the things that the Liberal Party of Australia is concerned about, and that is the reason why this principle is written firmly and enshrined in the platform of the Liberal Party of Australia. This present legislation, in seeking to recoup tax deemed payable as far back as 1972, will obviously have a retrospective effect. If the party that I represent in this place wants me to support retrospectivity it should strike that section out of our platform.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently in New South Wales the Wran Government suggested that it would amend its Stamp Duties Act to deal with payment of stamp duties on documents relating to New South Wales that were prepared outside that State. This would have meant that the legislation would have operated retrospectively to as far back as 62 years ago. Quite properly and quite rightly the New South Wales Liberal Opposition opposed that measure strongly, objecting to these changes on the basis of Liberal Party principles opposing retrospectivity. That amendment was subsequently withdrawn, very wisely, by the Wran Government. That case and the legislation currently before us bear striking similarities. They both seek to collect taxes avoided through legal loopholes and in both cases it is argued that existing legislation could be used to recapture taxes lost to revenue. The main difference, however, is that while in New South Wales the Liberal Party opposes such a measure on the grounds of opposition to retrospectivity, here in Canberra the Government of the same party is supporting retrospective legislation. The New South Wales action exemplifies my concern about retrospectivity. I believe that the Australian Labor Party would not hesitate to use that type of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently in a speech to the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Council of Australia, Senator Evans, the Opposition's legal spokesman, clearly indicated that retrospective measures would be used by a future ALP government. Following his speech on 2 November the Australian newspaper editorial stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The message was clear-a future Labor Government would have no qualms about adopting the retrospective precedent now established by the Fraser Government and using it in every conceivable case to squeeze the tax lemon dry . . . Senator Evans's proposed legislative war on tax avoidance sounds positively vindictive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans's attitude is in marked contrast to that of his former eminent colleague, former Senator John Wheeldon. In 1977, during the debate on the Curran legislation, Senator Wheeldon, as recorded on page 2571 of Hansard for 8 June 1978, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it would be appropriate if I were to intervene just briefly at this time to reaffirm the opposition of the Australian Labor Party to retrospective legislation. However odious one may feel the practices are that one is legislating against, it is our view that retrospectivity is a very evil principle and one which is undermining the principles of the rule of law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously the ALP no longer has qualms about enacting retrospective legislation. I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on two occasions stating my view quite plainly.

        I write regarding the taxation legislation which was introduced into Parliament last week.
       </para>
       <para>
        You are aware of my attitude to the principle of retrospectivity as I have expressed my opposition to this course of legislative action both with Party forums and publicly in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is only one circumstance which would persuade me to agree to applying retrospectivity to taxation legislation and that is if the Treasurer publicly details schemes which are regarded as illegal, and foreshadows legislative action that will be taken to collect taxes that are avoided between the announcement and the passage of legislation through Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would suggest that on such occasions, the Treasurer should clearly detail the schemes, publicly declare them to be illegal, foreshadow legislation to deal with them and, in addition, notify all societies of accountants, lawyers and tax consultants of the Government's intentions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This would not only clear up many of the problems that Party members have with retrospectivity, but would also warn the public that the schemes were illegal. If the schemes persisted, it would be obvious that the lawyers, accountants and tax consultants were flagrantly breaking the law and should be dealt with together with those of their clients who evaded tax in this way.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wrote to the Prime Minister on 4 October in these terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        My dear Prime Minister,
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the introduction of the package of taxation bills into Parliament, I have consulted with a prominent constitutional lawyer and others, who have raised a number of points that, I believe, need to be examined before the bills proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        1. CONSTITUTIONALITY: It has been suggested that whilst retrospectivity is not illegal under Australia's constitution, the current package may be challenged in the light of past Australian legal precedents. It is argued that Kidman's case and others may not be sufficient precedent to cover all aspects of the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        If doubts do arise, then costly and protracted legal challenges may ensue. This would obviously render law changes ineffective and would delay the recoupment of taxes criminally defrauded under ''bottom of the harbour'' schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. HUMAN RIGHTS: It is also argued that the changes may be in contravention of article 15 section 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -
       </para>
       <para>
        'No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under National or International law, at the time when it was committed'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given that Australia has only recently ratified this covenant, it would seem to ignore one of its tenets.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. HIGH COURT PRECEDENTS: The High Court has, in the past, provided lawyers, accountants and tax specialists with guidance in taxation matters. The Court, while not condoning tax evasion, has stated that one has a right to minimise tax payments. It has been suggested that the proposed legislation might run counter to the tenor of these decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Court has also served notice (Mason. J., Cridland 1977) that section 260 of Income Tax Act needed strengthening. It has been argued that in any legal challenge on this package of bills, this may be taken into consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, these matters require detailed examination. In the meantime I believe the Government should begin prosecutions using existing legislation and avenues available under the Income Tax Act, Companies Act and section 86 (e) of the Crimes Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister acknowledged receipt of that letter. He told me that he had referred those comments and copies of my letters to the Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe many people are worried that the legislation which we have before us could possibly have some holes in it. I believe that it was hurriedly prepared. As a result, I think that many innocent people could be caught in the net that we are spreading at this time. I do not believe that this legislation has been properly drafted. I think that has been indicated in the Press. The Australian Financial Review of 25 October 1982 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Taxation Department is concerned that the rush with which the retrospective tax legislation was prepared has left it full of technical faults.
       </para>
       <para>
        'There could be some quite significant technical problems still in there,' a departmental official said yesterday. 'We are not pretending otherwise.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Further on, the article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Since it is a 61-page, highly technical document drafted in weeks rather than the months which officials would usually demand for accuracy's sake, the potential for error is high.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was interested also to read comments made publicly by the Law Society of Australia as reported in the Australian of 15 October this year. I shall quote some of it:
       </para>
       <para>
        Opposition to the Federal Government's planned retrospective tax legislation mounted last night when the Law Society of Australia claimed it contained ' dangerous anomalies' which would seriously interfere with the legal rights of Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Don Mackay, the President of the Council of the Society, is reported in the article as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        We are particularly concerned that innocent people will be tangled up and become victims of hurried legislation . . . it appears the rights of innocent shareholders will not be protected because of political expediency.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the council has expressed strong support for the Government's campaign against tax evasion, Mr Mackay said it believed the proposed retrospective measures were 'contrary to fundamental rights and freedoms'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, I noted more recently, on Friday 12 November, that a headline in the Australian stated 'Retro tax row alarms Wall St'. I shall quote some of the article:
       </para>
       <para>
        The bitter controversy over retrospective tax legislation has damaged Australia 's image as a sound financial haven among many members of the US investment community. And grave doubts about the precedents created by such a move have been expressed in London . . .

       <para>
        In the US, Mr Nicholas Bratt, manager of the Scudder group's big Wall Street international fund told the Australian: 'It's one more nail in Australia's coffin as far as we're concerned.'
       </para>
       <para>
        In judging the investment climate in overseas countries, US money managers are particularly nervous of anything that smacks of a retrospective application of laws.

        Any such legislation is seen as setting dangerous precedents for unpredictable 'banana republic' action against investors, including wholesale nationalisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further on Mr Bratt says something with which I totally agree. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        We don't like the look of your Labor party.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say 'hear, hear' to that. I believe that what we are contemplating in this legislation is travelling down a road that is dangerous and unacceptable to the Liberal Party of Australia. I support anything to deal with these scurrilous parasites in our community who have fraudulently evaded tax, but let us deal with them firmly and positively. Let us strengthen section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as we have been advised to do-although we have ignored the advice. Let us deal with the matter under existing legislation. I shall support any amendment to this legislation which will give protection to those innocent people to whom I have referred.

         —As a Liberal senator from South Australia, I support the package of Bills before the Senate. I note that I am about the fifteenth or twentieth speaker in this debate, which has ranged over about three days, and that many views have been expressed conscientiously by senators from all parties. It is unlikely that I shall say anything new. However , I want briefly to put my own views on the legislation and emphasise the reasons why I believe the Senate should pass the Bills. All of us have been able to express our views clearly in this very well conducted debate in the Senate. My colleague from South Australia, Senator Jessop, is representative of those among my colleagues in the Liberal Party who are opposed to the legislation. None of us would deny them their right to express their point of view on these Bills.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        No one has yet spoken in this debate who is in favour of fraudulent evasion of tax. All of us are protesting about the cheating of the public purse that has been fully brought to light in reports, expecially those before the Government this year. It becomes then a question of judgment as to whether the measures that are before the Parliament will be the best path to follow to overcome this evasion and to determine what is the balance of principles-political and legal- that ought to gain priority in our minds when we come to making a decision on the Bills.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me briefly reconstruct the initial public concern that was very loudly expressed throughout Australia when the impact of the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the interim report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union about fraudulent tax evasion came to light. At that time, expecially in August and September of this year, the public expressed the view overwhelmingly that this cheating of the public purse had to be stopped and that the money that had been evaded should be recovered. So we have before us these Bills drafted by the Government, all of which are called unpaid company tax assessment Bills. It is in order to recover this money that the Government is responding to the rage expressed publicly throughout Australia at that time. Even though some weeks have gone by now, let us not forget the public's rage about so much money not being lawfully paid into government revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two reports that I mentioned have brought to light the fact that some $600m has been evaded through a scheme which has been widely discussed as the bottom- of-the-harbour tax evasion scheme. Ten thousand individual Australians were involved in this scheme over a period of about 10 years; that is, they were vendor shareholders in some 4,000 companies that were disposed of in the way that is now quite widely known as the bottom-of-the-harbour method. Forty promoters were involved in advancing arguments to these 4,000 companies that they could manage their affairs in this way and gain financially. Over this period $600m that was in fact already a debt to the branches of the Australian Taxation Office in the various States has just not been paid-company tax has not been collected-because the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme followed a process whereby there was nobody to answer for the debt that was on the books of the Australian Taxation Office.
       </para>
       <para>
        The great majority of Australians pay tax as they earn their income-by the week , by the fortnight or by the month-and they have no possible access to any such scheme that would evade the contribution that they make proportionally to the tax revenue that provides for government services throughout Australia. When 5 million or more ordinary taxpayers see a small minority making a gain of $600m through these fraudulent schemes it is quite understandable that they will express views to their representatives in this Parliament, whether in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, about taking steps to make sure that these schemes are stopped and that the money which is unpaid finally goes into government revenue. I believe that these fraudulent evasions are corrosive of our society. They undermine the sense of fairness in the taxation system; they undermine the fairness of laws as they operate between all Australians and they ruin public confidence in the taxation system itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some speakers who are opposed to this legislation have referred to the principle of retrospectivity. All of those who have supported the Bills, and I join them, have referred to this principle as one which may be transgressed only rarely. But of all the principles that are before us I believe that we must put into perspective the principles of fairness and confidence in the public's mind in the tax system. The balance of principles we must ensure by passing these Bills that the public does have confidence in the tax system and does see that there is a law which is operating fairly as between all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        This month the Bulletin published a public opinion poll that had been conducted by the Morgan Gallup Poll Australia-wide in October. It asked some 1,844 men and women what their opinions were about this package of Bills. Two-thirds of the people involved in that representative poll supported the new law. They supported these Bills that would recover the money that had been evaded through these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Sixty-five per cent of all people involved in the poll supported the new laws. Only 16 per cent were opposed and 19 per cent were undecided. As is set out in the article in the Bulletin published on 16 November this year, it was clear to all of those who were asked the poll questions that this was unusual law and that it would act in a retrospective way . Nevertheless, two-thirds of them expressed support for the retrospective Bills that are now before us. I believe that that was a credible poll. The result is consistent with the estimate I have made after talking with people, particularly in South Australia. I seek leave for the results of that poll, as published in the Bulletin, to be incorporated in Hansard.

         —I thank the Senate. Those who are opposed to the Bills have said that they have possible constitutional problems or that they were hastily drafted and ought to be delayed a little so that they can be refined to overcome any possible ambiguities. I do not ask for delay and I do not believe that we should entertain those arguments here. The public of Australia expects the Parliament to order the taxation affairs of the country so that fraudulent evasion will not go on and moneys that should be paid to the Australian Taxation Office are, in fact, collected.

        One of the major aspects of this debate has been the contribution from those who have put forward a so-called innocence clause. They acknowledge that there has been fraudulent evasion of tax but say that perhaps some of the 10,000 people in question have been involved in these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes unwittingly or innocently. Moreover, it is said that they may suffer some hardship in the payment of this tax that is now to be recouped from them as vendor-shareholders in the original companies. I do not believe that these Bills have anything to do with guilt or innocence. No one is guilty; no one is innocent. The Bills seek to recoup moneys. The Bills are about recoupment, not guilt or innocence. Let each individual make his own assessment about morals, values or involvements in the law. It is a question of recouping moneys that, it has never been doubted, have been owed to government revenue. I do not see any need for an innocence clause. What is being required is that the money that various vendor- shareholders and promoters have gained at the expense of the Australian Taxation Office be now paid. That is the case with all money that the Taxation Office, after a financial year, may recoup from a taxpayer because a liability has emerged.
       </para>
       <para>
        A person who, through a miscalculation of tax liability, has been required to pay a further amount of tax is not adjudged innocent or guilty. He is subject to recoupment of moneys that are owed to the Taxation Office. I believe that that is the case in this instance. So, by passing these Bills, we would not be subjecting those required to pay the uncollected taxes to some moral sanction of the Senate or of the Parliament-that they are thereby guilty of some immoral offence. Let that judgment be made by individuals on their heads. But we are asserting that moneys that ought to be paid to the tax revenue should be collected.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been arguments against these Bills that have centred directly on the principle of retrospectivity. It has been argued that the Bills will set a precedent. That is nonsense. Retrospective laws have been passed by every parliament in Australia and by similar parliaments overseas. On every hand there are precedents for retrospectivity. It is a matter for judgment in each individual circumstance as to whether the high principle of not allowing retrospective law should be transgressed in order to maintain some more important principle, the principles in this case being the exercise of fairness and retention of the confidence of the public in the taxation system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this debate we have seen some lawyers and accountants who are almost unable professionally to contemplate any law that is retrospective. I respect their consciences on this matter. I respect their values and their professional training but I have also observed that less purist lawyers and accountants who have participated in the debate in the Senate, or earlier in the House of Representatives, have I believe spoken more directly as politicians. They have not tossed aside their consciences to support these Bills. Yet they have gone through the same law schools and read the same authorities.

         —I use the word 'purity' in the academic sense. Some of those opposed to these Bills have said quoting all sorts of eminent lawyers, all sorts of learned academic opinion, that to go down the path of retrospectivity would be to undermine the rule of law in society, or to take away certainty in the law . Great play has been made of these principles. None of us will take lightly the experience and careful arguments of learned people. But I do not believe that the views of those whose tender consciences on this matter, because of their legal or accounting training, have led them to be reluctant concerning it, have impressed the great majority of those in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. What is clear is that there is certainly no criminal element of retrospectivity in the Bills before the chamber. It still remains my view to oppose totally any retrospective creation of criminal law. No penalty is involved in this law nor is a retroactive crime created.

        A pre-existing tax liability is to be collected now, through the procedures that are set out in the Bills, from the vendor shareholders and the promoters who made a financial gain as a result of processes in which their companies were involved. It is, in fact, not with very much surprise that we hear reference to the purist principle by some lawyers and accountants in the Parliament. Perhaps, because of their training, lawyers and accountants are conscientiously incapable of contemplating anything that would transgress retrospectivity. Let that be their tender consciences and their view which they have well expressed in the Parliament. The majority of us, I believe, in our own way are conscientiously responding to the clearly expressed rage of the public that such a corruption of the tax system can continue and that we are left powerless, because of such a principle, to effect a remedy. I believe that first of all, we are in this Parliament as politicians and as representatives of the people. We should make sure that where there is a gross transgression in the fairness of law or in public confidence in it we take the steps to remedy that situation.

        Reference has been made to the Liberal Party's platform. I, as a Liberal, take very seriously the statements set out in the platform and, indeed, the policies on which our Government goes to an election. To my knowledge-this was alleged by Senator Chipp earlier in the debate-the Government of which I am a supporter did not rule out by any explicit statement at the last election or any preceding election the possibility of these Bills being introduced. Similarly, the Liberal Party in its platform has expressed a number of principles and important guidelines. Ultimately, in a debate like this we have the duty to weigh conscientiously the principles and to come to a conclusion. I notice that only a few honourable senators have referred to promoters and to the clauses of these Bills that relate to the promoters of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Those honourable senators who have referred to those parts of the Bills that relate to promoters have applauded the inclusion of recovery action against those people who have been mostly responsible for perpetrating these tax evasion schemes. I join with them. I believe that not only should we gain fairness and justice in this matter by legislating against those who have taken on the whole taxation system in this way but also we should serve notice on those would-be promoters in the future who might dream up and promote some other fraudulent evasion scheme which is against the clear intentions of the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        I welcome the fact that the vendor-shareholders will not have to pay any penalty in relation to the amount of money that is to be recovered. I believe that in an earlier draft of the Bill that was a possibility. I believe that because of the retrospective aspect of this legislation there should not be any penalty. I certainly welcome the form in which the legislation is now presented. It should be noted that the tax debt that accrued in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977 or whatever the year in which it accrued is the amount that is to be recovered in 1982 or possibly 1983. The real value of the money that was not collected during the 1970s has decreased to some extent because of inflation. The tax that is required to be paid by these Bills is in real terms a lesser amount than the money which was then a debt to the tax revenue. To that extent, with the profitability that has come to those in whose hands the money rested in those years because of their ability to invest the money and to make a gain from investment, it is still undeniably the fact that these persons from whom the money is to be collected have, in fact, had the opportunity of further gain from that money. I do not want to see a penalty placed upon them because of the retrospective aspect of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I come back to the remarks that I made at the very beginning of my speech-at the time when this matter was most before the public there was an overwhelming expression of rage that the tax revenue could be cheated through these devices. There was a call for the representatives of the people in this Parliament to bring about a remedy. I believe we have that remedy in the same way as in the 20 or 30 instances of legislation which have been brought in by this Government to overcome tax evasion over recent years. I support the Bills strongly. In doing so I do not in any way give away in all circumstances the principle of retrospectivity. It remains an important principle that should be transgressed only rarely and where there is a flagrant introduction of unfairness, as we see in these instances. I note that the Opposition is supporting these Bills, perhaps two-thirds of Government members are supporting the Bills and, I am not sure maybe half the Australian Democrats are supporting the Bills. So, it would appear that these Bills will pass the Senate this week and that we will see demonstrated to the public of Australia a remedy that is sufficient to deal with the problem of tax evasion that has developed.

        The Bills before the chamber constitute the Government's response to an industry which ripped off hundreds of millions of dollars from public revenue. The response is a belated one and it is an inadequate one. It is a response which is seven years too late. It is a response which does not do half what its proponents claim it does. As I said, the Opposition supports the Bills. It does so on the basis that in government it will extend the ambit of the Bills. The legislation does not do anything to bring to account those people associated with the Liberal Party of Australia, those wealthy supporters who are currently running the campaign against the legislation; nor does it go far enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is trying to have it two ways in respect of this legislation. If it is tackling action which was legal at an earlier time why now does it distinguish this action from other forms of tax avoidance which have been highlighted in the series of reports by the same royal commissioners? If the action was then illegal why has the Government done nothing for the last five years in respect of it? As I said, the tax avoidance industry is essentially a recent one. Let me look at some quotations to support my claim. In the third interim report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union the Royal Commissioner says:
       </para>
       <para>
        This industry has developed in Australia, particularly over the last five years , at a rate far in excess of any other industry and has brought with it profits comparable only to the heady days of the Victorian gold rush.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The impact on the community has been very serious.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have had report after report in the last five or six years from the Commissioner of Taxation highlighting the problem. Between the 1975-76 financial year and the 1980-81 financial year we have had an increase of over 2,500 per cent in the numbers of persons identified as tax avoidance participants. The Government's response to this explosion has been quite limited. In fact, report after report of the Taxation Commissioner highlights the problem. I refer to page 11 of the current report. The Taxation Commissioner said:
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a substantial abatement in the use of tax avoidance schemes in 1981-82, but the number of experienced staff required to be allocated to the on- going task of detecting, monitoring, investigating and contesting tax avoidance schemes continues to make serious inroads into resources available for other administrative functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 22 of the report the Taxation Commissioner, in respect of investigations , said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The continuing decline in the extent of investigation activity to detect tax evasion, as illustrated in the following comparative statistics, is a direct result of the need during the year to deploy substantial resources (estimated to be in the region of 143 man-years) to the investigation of tax avoidance schemes and to other areas of administration. As I noted last year, undetected evaded tax which would have been detected had resources not been required for investigating avoidance activities is a substantial additional cost of tax avoidance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, we have had the Taxation Commissioner, year after year over the last six years, highlighting the problem. In a recent series of articles in the Australian Financial Review, David Solomon, a legal commentator, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Tax avoidance as an industry is a comparatively recent phenomenon.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, he goes on to highlight the start of the problem and refers to the Barwick decision in the case of the dry Slutzkin scheme. Chief Justice Barwick- in those days-said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the choice of the form of transaction by which a taxpayer obtains a benefit of his assets is a matter for him; he is quite entitled to choose that form of transaction which will not be subject to tax, or subject him only to less tax than some other form of transaction might do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Essentially what Chief Justice Barwick said then was, 'I am opening the gate. Whoever likes to hop into this tax evasion scheme can very well do so and the High Court in interpreting legislation in a very strictly literal sense will step out of your way.' The problem is a major one. It has only been in recent months that Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association calculated that almost $7,000m was lost in tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes in the last financial year. It is no wonder that Professor Mathews, a consultant to this Fraser Government, in 1980 said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . personal income tax is a voluntary tax for the rich non-salary earner.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the problems that has caused this major scandal in Australian economic history has been our company law. Federal government after Federal government either has not been allowed to tackle or has not tackled the problem of company law. I can do no better than quote Mr Ralph Jacobi, the honourable member for Hawker, who in a debate in the House of Representatives in respect of the same legislation said that the Costigan report had found that:
       </para>
       <para>
        Blue collar thuggary is married to white collar crime by seemingly respectable celebrants.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is precisely what has happened. In Australia we can set up companies with $ 2 and thereafter get involved in all sorts of lurks. Compare this situation with the situation throughout the world. Compare the situation with that in Great Britain where companies have to put up something like #50,000. The absence of a significant minimum share capital ensures that we have shell companies and facilitates a system of tax avoidance. That has been highlighted not only by the Taxation Commissioner and the McCabe-Lafranchi report but also by the New South Wales Government Corporate Affairs Commission, which estimated that approximately 4,000 companies in that State could be involved in tax avoidance schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        One group of people in this community pays for the problem that has been highlighted by the reports. It is not the rich friends of the Liberal Party, it is not foreign companies; it is those in the community who can least afford to pay. It is those wage and salary earners who have increased tax taken out of their pockets because of what has been happening in the corporate sector. It is those other middle income families who, because of decreased revenue to government, find themselves either paying more taxation or deprived of those services which they should be entitled to receive. In looking at the taxation figures we can see that wage and salary earners in fact are subsidising the tax parasites.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the 20 years from 1961-62 to 1981-82, there has been an increase of 38 per cent in the proportion of tax paid by pay-as-you-earn income earners. In that same period, there has been a decrease from 20 per cent to 13 per cent in the total tax paid by companies. In the last five years, those on salaries have paid over 148 per cent more of the tax cake and their wages have gone up by only 98 per cent, whereas the corporate sector, to which I referred earlier as blossoming under this Government, has had an increase of 73 per cent in its share of the tax cake while its income increased by 125 per cent. Those figures starkly show who is now paying much more tax. Those figures relate not to more of a tax cake of the same size. In fact under the Fraser Government, the Government that promised to alleviate the tax burden, the tax burden has increased. The proportion of gross domestic product paid by wage and salary earners-25.5 per cent-is the highest ever in this country's history and compares with the figure of 23.1 per cent when this Government took office.
       </para>
       <para>
        I quoted Professor Russell Mathews earlier. I will quote him again. In respect of this point, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The taxation system has become a major instrument for redistributing incomes and wealth in favour of the rich.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government speaker after Government speaker in this debate has said that the Government has done all it can, has acted nobly and has acted in all haste. With respect, the facts, the record, do not show this. The Costigan Royal Commission does not show this. Other associated reports also give the lie to the Government 's claim. The Government has failed to commit itself to effective means in this legislation. It has failed to do so in the past. It has failed to launch prosecutions under legislation which was passed in 1980. It took the combined efforts of the McCabe-Lafranchi and Costigan reports to shame it into some kind of activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Costigan report, there was detailed very clearly the spectacle of department fobbing off responsibility to department for over seven years. It is true that the first prosecution was authorised in the middle of 1975 under the Whitlam Labor Government. That file managed to find its way to the bottom of a drawer of an office in Perth. But that was not the only time when the problem was highlighted and presented to government. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) by his own admission knew in February 1978 that there was a major problem. The Commissioner of Taxation told him so in correspondence which has been presented to this Parliament. In May 1978, the Commissioner of Taxation made that clear when he 'recommended that a new criminal offence be created to catch those involved in current year profit strips'. In a report to the Treasurer in 1979, a statement which appears also in correspondence which has been tabled in the Parliament and which was dragged out of the Government by the Senate, the Commissioner of Taxation said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem of straw companies and straw trust evasion is already very serious and growing. It is my considered advice that the situation needs to be remedied urgently and with stern measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence shows that the Commissioner of Taxation did not leave it there. In fact the evidence also shows that for 18 months corres- pondence floated between the Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department. Then we got the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. As I said earlier, it still took at least two years and the full impact of McCabe- Lafranchi before the Government was stormed into taking some action.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the action encompassed by this legislation. Let us look at what the Government is doing compared with what it claims it is doing. What is proposed in this legislation is once again a network of loopholes, a sieve, for tax avoidance. If we analyse the Bills we find that we are presented with essentially a 12-point program for continued tax avoidance. It is a program that would do former Attorney-General Sir Garfield Barwick proud. Let us look at the dry Slutzkin scheme. It is one that has been discussed in this Parliament time and time again. The Government repeatedly has not distinguished between a dry Slutzkin scheme and a wet one. In May 1981, in discussing amending legislation to part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Treasurer said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of this further legislation is that the persons who stand to profit most by company stripping activities, the vendor shareholders also stand to pay heavily for any involvement in such activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposition applies to both bottom-of-the-harbour strips and strips of tax company profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Costigan, in his fourth interim report, volume 1, reported at pages 72 and 73 :
       </para>
       <para>
        The assets and liabilities of the target company were then transferred to the new corporate entity, leaving, at the end of the day, a target company with only cash in the bank. The amount of cash in the bank was equal to the accumulated profits, plus the current year profits (if any). The cash in the bank reflected that equation, and it was on that amount that the percentage constituting the promoter's commission was calculated. The total amount of cash in the bank was the money that was then used to finance the purchase of the shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        Costigan makes no distinction. The Treasurer, in his lead-up to this legislation , made no distinction but when the legislation was introduced we saw a distinction. A dry Slutzkin-type case is excluded and the cost to revenue of this one decision is calculated as being as much as $600m. It is quite ironical that this is somewhere near the amount of money that the Government is now crying out for to spend on job creation schemes. That money could much more easily come to it if it were to act effectively against tax avoidance. But it seems that its priority is very much to leave that money in the hands of those who, year after year, have avoided taxation and not put it in the hands of wage and salary earners in this community. This indicates the Government's priorities -priorities which, I believe, are objectionable not only to the Labor Opposition in this country but also to the overwhelming number of the electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us analyse the legislation further. We have a new clause 3 (12) in this Bill which does not sit too easily with the legislation which was withdrawn. We could call it the Horgan provision, the description given to it by my colleague Senator Walsh. Under this provision we find that a quarter of the companies which the Government initially intended to cover will not be covered by this recoupment legislation. Effectively, a company, after being stripped of its assets, which entered a post-sale tax avoidance scheme to reduce or eliminate tax is now exempt. So we will now have vendor shareholders escaping scot-free even though they received inflated prices for their shares. This third sieve is that the Bill is complex and is suited to the Peter Kleins of this business world. The fourth point is that clause 3 (2) of the legislation excludes as directors those persons acting in the performance of the functions attaching to their professional capacity or, as the Bill states, 'to his business relationship with the directors'. This clause exempts the professional masterminds of this scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to clause 3 (11). It was rather intriguing that Senator Teague saw some virtue in the Government not imposing a penalty tax but I have had constituent after constituent coming into my office-some of them are on incomes as low as invalid pensions-telling me that they have to pay taxation because, for some reason unknown to themselves, they did not include something in their tax returns-a mistake honestly made at the time. They have not been given the indulgence of 12 months in which to pay their unpaid tax. In fact those people are penalised from the moment the taxation was not paid. This legislation goes out of its way to do that; in fact the Government is bending over backwards to accommodate tax avoiders. They are given 12 months in which to pay but there is no penalty tax even though the original Bill provided for a 30 per cent penalty. Interim legislation provided for a 20 per cent penalty and now we find that these tax avoiders are exempt from a penalty. So money which has been in the pockets of these people for four, five, six or seven years, and will probably be so for the next couple of years-as Senator Teague pointed out, it is now deflated in value-will not incur a penalty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me go on to the sixth sieve. It is a problem which has been highlighted in respect of one particular case already. I believe it will be a continuing problem for law enforcement officers in this country. Clause 4 (8) provides that notices need to be served on the individuals involved. In the future we could have a situation in which a tax crook skips the country and skips liability even though he still has assets in Australia. The seventh part of the tax sieve is clause 5 (1) (j), which imposes a rather unusual test. This test provides that if business is carried on after the last sale the company is exempt.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would not take too much ingenuity on the part of tax evaders, with their word processors and all sorts of associated instruments, to concoct a business after the last sale. These artificial schemes are very much the cause of the problem. Under this legislation these artificial schemes could very well continue. The eighth part of the sieve, I believe, stems from clause 5 (1) (m). This clause will effectively mean a tax deduction for the fees paid to the tax promoters. In fact, the taxpayer will be subsidising fees paid by vendor shareholders to tax promoters during the course of their ripping off of public revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to the ninth part of this sieve which has been presented to us by the Government. I believe it is the combined effect of clause 5 (1) (g) and clause 5 (2) (g). It presents a loophole in a situation in which a company is stripped at the same time as or just before the company entered into a tax avoidance scheme. The vendor-shareholder could argue that at the time the company was sold it did not have a tax liability, a liability for unpaid taxation, and, as a consequence , the company is exempt. It would not take too much for an artificial scheme to organise for a company to sit within that special provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer now to the tenth point in this respect. Tax avoiders will now be given time to pay when millions, if not billions, of dollars are involved, whereas the poor individual taxpayer in this community has been screwed down year after year by penalty fines and the strict enforcement of legislation, even in circumstances where individuals have been living on invalid pensions. The eleventh point relates to the fact that there will be no attempt to recoup tax which was lost and which would otherwise have been paid on dividends distributed to shareholders. This is a rather scandalous situation. It does not sound as though it will be a big cost to revenue, but the Treasurer, in correspondence to the shadow Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, dated 8 November 1982, said:

        Had such amounts, totalling some $1280m in profits, been distributed as dividends in the years in which the companies were stripped, it is thought that about $500m in income tax would have been payable.

        The Treasurer went on to make a rather well documented case for the introduction of a capital gains tax, a case which I tend to agree with. Despite that, in the vicinity of $500m will be lost to revenue because of the distinctive decision of this Government. Let me make one point in respect of this correspondence. There is nothing new in the figures. None of the figures would have been hard for the Treasurer to find. But the Treasurer waited until two days after the debate took place in the House of Representatives before he had enough gall to present the shadow Treasurer with that information.

       <para>
        The last point of this legislation which I find objectionable relates to the naming of persons involved in tax avoidance schemes. Those persons who have been involved in understating their taxable income are detailed in the annual reports of the Commissioner of Taxation. There is nothing new about that. We have a major financial scandal which has embarrassed the Government. We now find that the Government, in order to protect those people with whom it is extremely closely associated-documentation has been produced by the Opposition in respect of this matter time and time again-and who have been involved in this billion dollar tax rip-off, is saying that those people will not be named by the Taxation Commissioner. The naming provision was included in the initial legislation. It no longer sits in this legislation. That highlights the approach of this Government. The Government wants to be seen to be doing something but it does not want to be seen to be doing what it is precisely doing.

        We have had argument after argument by Government senators and Government spokespeople about the retrospective nature of the legislation. They say they find something objectionable with it. They say that it does not agree with Liberal Party philosophy. They say that it is unfair, uncertain and so on. Let us initially have a look at Liberal Party philosophy. I refer to the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950-a rather scandalous piece of legislaion for a number of reasons. In that legislation, no other person, no greater a person-and I imagine there would not be a greater one in Liberal Party history-than Prime Minister Menzies introduced legislation retrospective and criminal in nature and imparting all sorts of horrific penalties. In 1950 the then Mr Menzies is reported as saying at page 2006 of Hansard:
       </para>
       <para>
        Not one of us in this House has any love for retrospective legislation. But quite clearly, as a matter of plain horse sense, if this bill dealt only with those who could be shown to be Communist party members on the date on which this bill becomes an act obviously there would then be no party members or officers to be affected by it and the legislation would be a complete futility. We are not prepared to facilitate a farce of that kind.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sir Robert Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party, in 1950 saw a need and a role for retrospective legislation. But let us not leave the matter there. Let us look at what was said by Mr Hunt, the Liberal Party leader in the upper House of the Victorian Parliament. An article in the Melbourne Age of Monday 22 November 1982 stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Liberal Party in the Upper House, Mr Hunt, said that in 21 years in Parliament he had supported more than 150 pieces of retrospective legislation with a clear conscience.
       </para>
       <para>
        'If anyone tells me that is not Liberal, or contrary to principle, I say we don 't belong to the same party,' he said. 'It's nonsense to create an overall principle where none exists.'
       </para>
       <para>
        The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        'There is no such principle that all retrospective legislation is contrary to the principles of the party. What has happened this time is that someone who didn't like bottom-of-the-harbour legislation has sought to raise a principle and use it to criticise the Government by innuendo.'

         —False raising of principles. One can ask why this push has started within the forums of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. The answer is very clear. We will find that the people in the Liberal Party in Western Australia are those who are most directly implicated by this scandalous affair. However, it is interesting to note the views of members of the Liberal Party through the ages on retrospectivity.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Members of the Australian legal system have also made some comments in respect of retrospective legislation. I will quote one of them. Mr Justice Adam in the case D'oro v. Victorian Railways Commissioner in 1960-and this is a principle with which I agree-said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The strength of the presumption against retrospectivity in any particular case, and accordingly the ease or difficulty with which it may be overcome, must, I would think, depend on the nature and degree of the injustice which would result from giving the statute a retrospective operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, where to give retrospective operation to a statute might be considered to work some injustice to one party, but is clearly required to rectify a manifest injustice to others, there would, on principle, seem little reason for giving much weight to the presumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is precisely the situation we have now when hundreds of millions of dollars are being ripped off from the public purse. This money has to be made up by other sectors of the community and in that sense retrospectivity is justified.

       <para>
        The argument has been put in respect of so-called innocent vendor-shareholders. This has been the catchcry of those most deeply implicated in this matter. They say that the innocent vendor-shareholder is the one who will have to foot the bill. It is rather curious that in the last three months-three months of intensive debate-not one innocent vendor-shareholder has come forward and said; 'I am going to be unfairly penalised by this government legislation'. In fact, as my collegue Senator Robert Ray said earlier today, it is harder to find one innocent vendor-shareholder in this country than it was to find one Nazi after World War II. Let us look at the case put forward by the dissidents in the Liberal Party. Let us assess it on the basis of the long stated Liberal principle of 'grab the money and run', and let us reject it. I believe that the legislation is inadequate. But because of the extent to which it does go, the Labor Opposition and I will support it.

         — We are debating the group of Bills under the general heading of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Bills, otherwise known as the Government's recoupment legislation or, probably wrongly, as the Government's retrospective tax legislation. I will not go through how the bottom -of-the-harbour scheme worked; that has been gone through in great detail by previous speakers, but I wish to make a couple of points. First of all, the necessity for this legislation was brought about by the said scheme. We are dealing with people who received a benefit because funds that should have been set aside for the payment of a company's tax were not so set aside. In other words, the vendor shareholders about whom we are talking received, when they sold their company, a sum which was considerably greater than they could reasonably have expected in a normal commercial sale-because the promoters to whom they sold their company had no intention of paying that company's tax liabilities. I think it is important that most people should understand right from the start the fact that money for that purpose was not set aside, that the companies concerned had tax liabilities and the promoters who bought them had no intention of paying that tax. I imagine that that is the crux of the whole problem. That is why we are where we are today.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I shall deal now with this legislation so far as retrospectivity is concerned. In very basic terms, retrospective revenue legislation attempts to create new income tax liabilities. This legislation plainly does not do that, so it can hardly be retrospective in the full sense of the term. In this case the stripped company's income tax liabilities are still outstanding to the Commonwealth. They were due when the company was stripped and they are still due. The recoupment tax legislation seeks to make the vendor-shareholders and promoters personally liable for the stripped company's income tax liability. To that extent the vendor-shareholders and promoters will now be personally liable and the legislation can be said to be retrospective in nature. I dare say that that is the problem with the misunderstanding concerning the meaning of the word ' retrospective'. There is, shall we say, an element of retrospectivity in the legislation but it is certainly not retrospective legislation in the full sense of the term. I think everybody who is paying any attention to this legislation should understand one thing right from the beginning: The law was broken when untaxed company profits were stripped. We have not made a new law that says that what was legal in the past will now be illegal. The law was broken when the company, which had an unpaid tax liability, was stripped. It is not correct to infer that somehow or other we are now making illegal what was then legal.
       </para>
       <para>
        This recoupment legislation serves one purpose and one purpose only: It short circuits the massive legal problems connected with the multiple prosecutions and simply recovers unpaid taxes which are owed, and have been all along, to the Commissioner of Taxation. It does not make anything illegal, it does not make anything a crime, it does not create a new offence and it does not make people criminals. All that it requires is that those who benefited from the evasion of tax, which was always legally payable, now pay what is owing. I think it must be said that it also provides rights of objection against the recoupment of unpaid tax-the same rights as any citizen has when seeking reassessment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to the innocence clause. This has been brought up quite often and quite genuinely by many people who are concerned that people might have got involved in these schemes without knowing their full intent. Unfortunately, I think it is a basic tenet of law that ignorance is no excuse under the law. I suppose we can all recall at some stage or another being pulled up by a traffic policeman and saying that we thought we were in a 100-kilometre zone when in fact, we were not . That does not wash. We have to have a better story than that. Ignorance is no excuse under the law. Even if somebody in the car had told a driver that he was in a 100-kilometre zone and the driver told the policeman that, he would still not be likely to get out of the fine if he were in an 80-kilometre zone. There is a fair onus on the driver and a responsibility on the taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proponents of the innocence clause overlook-in some cases, I think, deliberately, in others quite concernedly-the fact that this recoupment legislation is only a revenue law. The legislation does not connote any guilt or innocence. It is not a criminal law. Thus, any talk of an innocence clause is irrelevant to the purpose of the recoupment legislation. One either owes the Commissioner of Taxation money or one does not. One can seek a reassessment and if it is favourable one is better off. For legislation to contain an innocence clause it has either to connote guilt or innocence. I think it is worthy to recognise that approximately six million people pay direct tax in Australia today. About 5,000 or 6,000 companies and about 12,500 vendor-shareholders are involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. As I have said on many occasions, Australia is a large land mass with a very small tax base, vis a vis many other countries. Thus, we quite rightly expect our Government to provide good transport, communications, defence, education and health. It behoves every taxpayer to accept his or her responsibility and pay his or her share of tax. Unfortunately, in society today many people see it as their business to get out of accepting their responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tax dodging seems to be indicative of a malaise that exists in the land today. When I spoke in the debate on the report of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, I said that meat substitution was indicative of the greed and selfishness that exists in society. Dodging of taxes is really no different from the meat substitution scandal. The Government has given notice also that it will stop dealings in the cash economy. That is indicative also of the greed in society. People are dodging tax in this way, probably to a greater extent than those involved in the wet Slutzkin scheme. Quite rightly, the Government provides members of the business community with means to minimise their tax. Let us face it, the business community is the engine room of our society. It keeps the economy going and provides jobs. I have no objection to tax minimisation. Most people would welcome the fact that there is provision for businessmen to minimise taxes in order to put more money back into their businesses. But a few go beyond the measures provided and seek to rip off the whole system. In ripping off the system they rip off this country and the rest of the people who accept their responsibility.

        Senator Chipp and a few other people have mentioned morality. Of course, we cannot legislate for morality but we must question morality at a time when we are seeking to have a wage freeze in this country. I am not debating that. There are plenty of good, cogent arguments for that, but one must question the morality of people in this chamber who advocate a wage freeze for the wage earners of this country and who, at the same time, would let people get away with dodging their responsibility and their obligations to the whole of society through the tax system as it exists in Australia.

While it does not include bankruptcies where the estates are administered by a trustee other than the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, the number of estates administered by private trustees prior to 1 January 1982 is statistically insignificant.

       Several departments are jointly conducting an integrated advertising campaign in the second half of November drawing the attention of members of the public to their entitlements under a number of Budget measures, most of which became effective from 1 November.
      </para>
      <para>
       The campaign consists of a general TV advertisement briefly highlighting the main measures which came into effect in November-personal tax reductions, home loan interest tax rebates, changes to social security entitlements-as well as increased assistance to youth through student schemes and work experience programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The aim of the television advertisement is to alert as many people as possible to their entitlements.
      </para>
      <para>
       To support the TV campaign there are separate press advertisements which will give details of social security benefits, housing aid and assistance to youth. Each of these advertisements advises the public on how to take further action to obtain their entitlements. Information material in pamphlet form is also being prepared to follow up the Press advertising on housing by assisting people who deal with the public on housing matters to be better able to advise their clients.
      </para>
      <para>
       Total expenditure on advertising for the integrated campaign will be about $2m. Funds will be provided by the participating departments.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government was aware that the public would need further information on the Budget measures which came into effect on 1 November so that they could, as appropriate to their circumstances, make applications for the various entitlements.
      </para>
      <para>
       I might add that this campaign is consistent with the recommendation of the Task Force on Departmental Information that 'due consideration be given to the effectiveness of other than print media in communicating with disadvantaged groups, for example radio and television . . .'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The need for the program is recognised by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate who claimed people are not being told adequately about Government welfare programs (Senate Notice on Motion No. 28), and by the Opposition Spokesman on Social Welfare, Senator Grimes, who said 'what is needed is a proper advertising campaign' including the use of television.

      <para>
       (3) Of the projects listed above, those which are concerned with automated mechanical shearing and biological defleecing may provide what could be regarded as a viable new wool harvesting system which could be of benefit to growers. The balance of the projects relate to the development of improvements on present systems. At this stage, it is too early to say whether it will be possible to produce a viable new commercial wool harvesting system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) to (8) Whilst it is premature to predict whether automated mechanical shearing or biological defleecing can produce a commercially successful system for harvesting wool in the future, the present research and development should help to provide the answer.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to automated mechanical shearing, a commercial pre-development feasibility analysis is currently being undertaken. This should provide the Corporation with sufficient information upon which to make a decision to develop automated shearing, if appropriate. The Corporation hopes that such information will be available by the end of 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to biological defleecing, the questions of commercial and technical feasibility and of economic viability are presently being reviewed by an independent committee, chaired by Professor Kennedy of the University of New South Wales. This review committee should be reporting to the Wool Harvesting Research Advisory Committee in March 1983. It may be possible that some of the questions raised by the honourable senator will be answered in at least a preliminary fashion at that time.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) In the middle of the last decade, shearing systems involving mechanical restraint and positioning of sheep during shearing were extensively investigated by the Corporation. The systems ranged from production line or chain shearing techniques-where shearers or lesser skilled personnel operated on particular zones or areas of the sheep-to mechanical restraint techniques where each shearer or operator was responsible for fleece removal from the whole sheep.
      </para>
      <para>
       Shearing trials involving around thirty thousand sheep demonstrated that per sheep costs of shearing using systems based on production line or chain shearing techniques would be unlikely to be less than shearing costs using conventional ' on the board' shearing in an efficient shearing shed using modern equipment and simplified clip preparation procedures. Consequently, there was not seen to be any advantage to woolgrowers in those systems which would have justified the capital costs of the necessary additional equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is understood that the principles of Mr Geary's systems have been developed in equipment which has been commercially available. The Corporation is not aware that any such equipment has met with grower acceptance and commercial success. In view of those assessments, the Corporation has given priority in its recommended research program to the projects listed above.

        —On 21 October (Hansard, page 1686) Senator Watson asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question was concerned with the processing of part of the wool stockpile of the Australian Wool Corporation.

       The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       A limited authority has been given to the Australian Wool Corporation to arrange for the processing of wool it acquires in the operation of the reserve price scheme. Wool purchased at auction by the Corporation under the reserve price scheme is stored both in Australia and at overseas locations adjacent to major wool processing areas. The processing authority provided to the Corporation enables it to decide where such processing may more appropriately be carried out.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Corporation has in stock significant quantities of wool which normally would be carbonised. The recent authority given to the Corporation facilitates the carbonising of these wools in Australia and substantial orders have been placed with seven local wool processing firms in recent weeks to process such wool. In a period when these firms are experiencing very depressed orders and turnover, the Corporation arrangements are helping to keep the industry's specialised work force in employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not practical to give an assurance that 'such authority will be withdrawn once the stockpile of carbonised wool has reached a satisfactory level'. Given the sluggish demand for wool and the continuing purchases by the Corporation under the reserve price scheme of wools suitable for carbonising, it is difficult to know to what extent the stockpile of carbonised wools may rise.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted, however, that the Corporation is required by the Wool Industry Act 1972 to perform its functions for the advantage of Australian woolgrowers and the Australian economy, and it is certainly not envisaged that the Australian Wool Corporation would make decisions in breach of that obligation.

        —On 10 November 1982 (Hansard, page 2112) Senator Button asked me as the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, the following question, without notice:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Is it a fact that the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee has requested the Australian Government to provide: 'A statement of intent regarding the construction of dams, on the possibility of extending the protected area of South West Tasmania and establishing a co-ordinated mechanism to manage this site'? Has the Bureau requested this statement of intent from the Australian Government? What arrangements have been made to provide a reply to the information requested by the Bureau and who in fact has the responsibility to forward Australia's response on this matter? Will the answers be provided before the World Heritage Committee meets, I think in December or early February?

       The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bureau of the World Heritage Committee met in June this year to consider the nomination by the Australian Government for the World Heritage List of the Western Tasmanian Wilderness National Parks. The Bureau agreed to recommend to the full Committee at its session in December 1982 that the nomination be accepted for listing but agreed to ask the Australian authorities to provide a Statement of Intent regarding construction of dams and other works in the nominated area including relevant details of the area to be flooded. The Bureau has also suggested that consideration be given to adding some other areas to those already nominated.
      </para>
      <para>
       At present the question of Commonwealth action in relation to South West Tasmania is under active consideration by the Government. When the matter has been determined, an appropriate response will be made by the Government to the World Heritage Committee.
