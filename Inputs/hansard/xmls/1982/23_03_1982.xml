      <para>
       (a) The new sales tax to be imposed on books will:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Result in proportionally higher prices for books, since the tax is to be applied to several stages of book production;
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Cause increases in costs to students and educational bodies, who personally and collectively are already suffering from financial cutbacks;
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Further threaten the Australian book trade and jeopardise the publication of Australian works;

       (4) restrict the flow of information in the community and form a tax on knowledge and ideas.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) That the new sales tax to be imposed on clothing, hand tools, footwear, packaging and wrapping, newspapers and magazines, and the increased sales tax on stationery will further add to the financial hardships faced by students and other low income earners.

      <para>

       That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.

        —As I indicated in my statement to the Senate when giving notice of disallowance of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Regulations, the effect of these regulations is to continue in force a limitation imposed in the Schedule to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act on the rights of certain individuals to receive reasons for decisions on promotions, transfers and appeals in the Australian Public Service. At the time the notice was given, I indicated to the Senate that the Government was then considering the issue of giving reasons for promotion and transfer decisions within the context of new procedures contained in the Public Service Amendment Bill which is at present before the House of Representatives.

       The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has now advised of the Government's decision that amendments should be introduced to the Public Service Amendment Bill to make specific provision for giving, on request, information regarding decisions to promote or transfer individual officers to persons affected by those decisions. He further advised that a consequential amendment is proposed to be made to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, to be introduced at the same time, to exempt from the requirements of that Act decisions in respect of which information will be provided in accordance with the amendment to the Public Service Amendment Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee, having considered the advice, together with a detailed outline of the proposals, decided to seek an undertaking from the Government that the proposed amendments to the Public Service Amendment Bill and the proposed consequential amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act would be brought forward for debate in both Houses of Parliament during the present period of sittings. The Committee has now received a response from the Government to its request for the undertaking, but has not yet had an opportunity to consider it. The Committee has also received a further representation from the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association.
      </para>
      <para>
       As this is the last day on which notice of disallowance may be resolved the Committee will be giving urgent consideration to the response later this day. For procedural reasons and to preserve the right of other senators to take over the notice if they wish, I now give notice, in accordance with Standing Order 109A, that it is my intention during the consideration of business later this day to withdraw Business of the Senate, Notice of Motion No. 1, standing in my name and relating to the disallowance of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Regulations as contained in Statutory Rules 1981 No. 274 and made under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. As this statement indicates, however, no decision has yet been made on whether to proceed with withdrawal. I also propose at placing of business to postpone consideration of the notice of disallowance to a later hour of the day to enable the Committee to conclude its deliberations.

         — I have not seen the article referred to by Senator Button. I think it ought to be said that the housing package that was announced addressed itself to assisting those in the pursuit of home ownership. The package had a variety of measures within it. Part of it involved providing a rebate within the tax system for those in the early years of home purchase. Another part of the package was to means test the homes savings grant which assists in bridging the deposit gap that many people find. I suppose if people were to draw away from the matters that were addressed in that statement they could find other areas where assistance equally could be granted. The package that was produced addressed itself to assisting people in purchasing their homes . I think, in conjunction with the consultation with the banks and others, it was a very worthwhile package and was well received throughout Australia. If some other debate on aspects of the matter is necessary, perhaps we can have that at a more appropriate time. Suffice it to say in Question Time that I believe this package will be of great assistance to the many thousands of prospective and present home owners to whom it has been addressed.

         — As I said, the policy addresses itself to those already in pursuit of owning their homes. It could be argued that there are other areas where assistance may be given. The priority in this particular package was given to assisting people to achieve the ownership of their own homes. The high percentage of home ownership and the objective of continuing that high percentage of home ownership throughout Australia were drawn out in many of the statements that were made. Home ownership was one of the principal factors in the way in which the Government did address the measures that we are now discussing.

        I would not argue that if we want a more complete package we may have more funds that could be directed to welfare housing or we may have larger assistance directed to rent. There is a package that can be used in conjunction with State governments in emergency or crisis situations to give assistance. The package, as it was presented, was comprehensive in a number of ways. Let us not argue about what was not done but rather let us look at the positive assistance that that package will be able to give.

         —I was advised of such a program and of such allegations . I made a statement on the matter because, frankly, I am at a loss to understand the suggestion that the Atomic Energy Commission may be engaged in nuclear weapons research. This is a perennial allegation and it is totally without fact. As a party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, Australia has entered into a solemn international commitment not to engage in such activities. Compliance with the treaty is verified through the system of international safeguards established by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In fact last week, at the time when the allegations apparently were made, International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards inspectors completed an inspection of Lucas Heights. Although they have not yet had time to lodge their official report, I am advised that they were satisfied that Australia is complying with the non- proliferation obligations.

        A claim was also made that there have been a number of radioactive emissions from Lucas Heights, particularly strontium-90, but because there have been no public health surveys over the past 25 years the effect of these emissions is not known. In fact, the Atomic Energy Commission regularly monitors emissions from Lucas Heights. New South Wales health authorities have examined the Commission's monitoring methods and are satisfied with them. The Commission's activities do not release strontium-90 to the atmosphere in quantities sufficient to be detectable against background fallout due to weapons tests. The Australian Radiation Laboratory carries out a national program of monitoring strontium-90 levels and has advised that strontium-90 levels in the Lucas Heights environment are consistent with levels found elsewhere throughout Australia and known to have arisen entirely from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. I do hope that such unfounded allegations are not made. There is no basis for them at all.

I might add that I was approached by a member of this association at the Rockhampton Airport yesterday. That member asked me to make strong representations on this case. It appears that the General Manager of the Commonwealth Games, Mr Whitehead, acknowledges that if the Games were to be held in a leap year the application for toad racing may have been more successful. Traditionally this ethnic group has suffered blatant prejudice at the hands of homo sapiens and, as unwilling migrants to our country, they do not have a leg to leap on. Also being provincially based offers little opportunity for their chorus of voices to be effectively heard in the capital cities.

I think it is known that at present we are receiving deputations from a number of industry groups in the pre-Budget consultation process. However, I do not wish to make any comment on what may have been said by my colleague Sir Phillip Lynch in his speech because it is not the practice in a pre-Budget situation to canvass alternative proposals, but perhaps I should say this: At this stage there is no proposal before the Government with regard to changes in the corporate tax rate, although I presume that by the time we complete the Budget process almost every suggestion imaginable will have been put before us by people either outside or within government. In regard to PAYE tax, again I do not speculate on any decisions that may be taken in the process of compiling this year's Budget. I am aware of figures which show that there will be an increase in the collections of personal income tax. I would think that as we are in this pre-Budget context it remains for me just to say that I do not speculate on any changes in either company tax or personal tax that will result from Budget deliberations but that the Government is receiving many representations in both areas at present.

In the past the Australian Government has taken advantage of appropriate opportunities to register with the Soviet authorities the widespread concern in Australia about abuses of human rights in the USSR, and it will continue to do so. It is hoped that the expression of this kind of concern will help to persuade the Soviet Government to reconsider and to modify its policy on human rights, including the right to religious freedom.

It offers essentially the same features as the system which Telecom proposed. The national service proposed appears to offer local call access in all State capital cities except Hobart and excludes Canberra and Newcastle. Subscriber trunk dialling access is possible from country areas to the capital city nodes. It uses the CDA network to link State centres to the Melbourne computer.

         —No double standards have been applied in the handling by the Minister of the cases referred to by Senator Mulvihill. The Minister ordered deportation in all three cases. The difference between the cases that have been identified by Senator Mulvihill arises from the fact that there was a difference in whether the people concerned had a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the merits of the Minister's decision. Mr Renata was a prohibited immigrant by virtue of his criminal record in New Zealand prior to his arrival in Australia. He was deported as a prohibited immigrant for that reason and, as such, does not have a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Messrs Collins and Stone were legal residents in Australia. Their deportation was ordered pursuant to section 13 of the Migration Act for convictions incurred in Australia. In one case the offence was committed in New Zealand; in the other case the offences were committed in Australia. As Mr Collins and Mr Stone were legal residents of Australia, they were entitled to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the Minister's decision.

         —There were some articles concerning negotiations on the pipeline in the Australian last week. They were inaccurate and misleading. They have caused some confusion and some irritation. The Northern Territory Government did not issue any ultimatum to the Commonwealth as stated in the Australian. Mr Everingham, in fact, told me of the options open to the Northern Territory Government which were being examined with the aim of meeting deadlines for the pipeline construction. These deadlines arose from agreements which had been made between the Northern Territory Electricity Commission and the group developing the Palm Valley field.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I made it clear to Mr Everingham that only one option was acceptable and that was that we proceed with the grant of title of land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and that we go into negotiations with the Central Land Council for the creation of an easement for the pipeline. The Northern Territory Government has accepted this view. It has asked for some understandings. We have given them. They are that the title for the land will be issued within two months and that the Central Land Council will enter into immediate negotiations on the pipeline with a view to reaching agreement on the terms of the easement by the middle of the year. Changes to the Act decided upon last year to enable title to be granted on terms acceptable to the Aboriginal people of Hermannsburg have been introduced and in fact, were passed in the Senate last week. I thank the Senate for the speedy passage that it gave this legislation. The necessary survey work for the easement has been proceeding for many months. It is nearly completed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The articles in the Australian suggested, quite falsely, that the CLC had been unwilling to negotiate, that there was dispute among the Aboriginal people concerned, that the Hermannsburg people on this issue were pressing for the formation of a separate land council and that the traditional owners have yet to be identified. In fact, the Aboriginals concerned are ready and willing to negotiate. I have some copies of messages signed by their leaders to that effect . I will table those letters of agreement in a moment. The traditional owners have been identified. A pipeline route avoiding significant sites has been cleared by the Central Land Council. It was suggested in the Australian last week that the amendments before the Senate were some kind of response to what the Australian called 'threats by the Chief Minister, Mr Everingham, to cancel a key gas pipeline project'. Honourable senators would realise that those amendments had obviously been cleared and had been processed for some months ready for their introduction in the Senate last week.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, the Aboriginal people will be granted all the land designated in Schedule 1 to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in 1976 concerning which there had been a delay. Negotiations on the gas field and on the pipeline will proceed in accordance with the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act. The go-ahead has not been given since an agreement between the CLC and the Northern Territory Government on the pipeline has yet to be concluded. I am confident that agreement of course will be reached and that another major project will be brought on stream, as have other projects which have been completed, with the proper processes of the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act being observed and put into place.

Undoubtedly it is the most serious matter that has affected Australia as a whole for many years. Its potential for severity is extremely real. There is no doubt in the world that quite apart from its devastating effect upon those in New South Wales who will lose a significant part of their week's pay, the overall effect upon Australia in loss of production and trade is real indeed. I point out that Australia has the immense resources, both in terms of energy and minerals, to seize the opportunity to meet the demands of other countries for our trade but, unfortunately, we have not the capacity, due to artificial reasons.

        As for the general situation, the Commonwealth takes the very strong view that everything that can possibly be done should be done to help the people of New South Wales in their present difficulties. If there are matters we can help them with, we will do so. We are co-operating fully with regard to the Snowy Mountains. Without any request having come from New South Wales, we have imposed a voluntary restriction of electric power upon the Australian Capital Territory, and I invite all honourable senators and the people of the Australian Capital Territory to observe it.

         —Is the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of a Press report in the Age of 16 March which stated that both unions and employers have now expressed opposition to the three 'anti-industrial relations Bills' proposed by Mr Viner on automatic stand-downs, enterprise unions and employment preference for unionists? In view of this, is it the Government's intention to review its confrontationist approach to industrial relations and to develop an industrial relations policy designed to promote co- operation between employers and employees? If so, what action does the Government propose to take in the present situation?

         —No, the Government does not propose to pursue a confrontationist policy with the trade union movement. It intends to pursue policies which will ensure that there is a reasonable balance in the Australian community between employers and employees and, indeed, between the community's interests and trade union interests. Those balances are not easy to establish and will certainly be a matter of some argument. It would be wrong to suggest that the Government is putting forward its current proposals in the spirit of confrontation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate that the basic proposals which the Government has indicated it is putting forward relate to the question of whether a man can be forced to join a trade union if he is to have a job, the question of whether an employer has to continue to pay employees even when no work is available to them because of industrial action, and the question of the basis on which trade unions should be established in Australia, whether on a craft basis, an industry basis or even , indeed, an employer basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst I concede that there is room for honest differences in this matter I would have thought that the broad viewpoint which would be acceptable in the community would be that the fact that a man does not wish to join a union ought not be something which precludes him from obtaining employment. I would have thought that there would be general agreement that where an employer is not able to provide work for his employees, not because of his own fault but because of the fault of a trade union's action, he ought not be required to keep those people on and to pay them wages when they cannot work. I would have thought that it was common ground that, at least at the industry union level, there was considerable interest in the development of that proposal not only on this side of politics but also on the other side of politics.
       </para>
       <para>
        As is known to the Senate-indeed, it has been the subject of some discussion- there have been consultations between the Government and the major interested parties, namely, employers and the trade unions, with respect to the proposals that Mr Viner, on behalf of the Government, has indicated he is bringing forward . Those consultaions have extended over some time and the Government is considering the views which have been put forward during those consultations in arriving at the final shape of the proposal which is to be put before the Parliament for its consideration and, I trust, approval. There has been debate in the Senate about what has gone to the National Labour Consultative Council. I do not think that it will advance the matter. I know the honourable senators opposite do not want me to debate the matter in Question Time. I can only say in response to the question which has been asked by Senator Siddons that there have useful consultations with both trade unions and employers. Those consultations have certainly had an influence on the shape of what is to be brought before this Parliament and what is being done is not being done in a spirit of confrontation.

Is the Treasurer aware that the 1981 profits of the five largest private banks total $560m? Is it a fact that the banks will be given a further profit boost of the order of $75m as a result of a lift in interest rate charges on existing home loans and at least another $50m as a result of the increased interest rates payable on statutory reserve deposits?

         — To answer the last part of the question first, I think the Treasurer would not acknowledge that the only beneficiaries of the housing package announced last week would be the banks, for the very simple reason that in the package there are some additional measures that directly relate to individuals through the tax rebate system. Other proposals will be of assistance to individuals in their quest for a home. As far as citing figures on the profitability of banks is concerned, I think we would always need to look at the capital employed before looking at profit. Certainly in some areas of the lending capacity of the banking sector, there has now been an increase in interest rates. But everyone who looks at the banking sector or the other part of the financial sector would realise that in order to be able to lend money such banking and other institutions must be able to borrow money. In the whole process of what has been arranged with the banks a further $400m will be released to assist those people who are seeking loans for their home purchase. That in itself should make it possible for thousands of people to receive loans in a way in which they would not have been able to do had we not had the whole package which was put before the Parliament last week. I could not agree-I am sure the Treasurer would not agree-that the only beneficiaries are the banks. In fact, I think the Treasurer has already acknowledged the great co-operation which came from the banks in assisting us in putting together the package which we believe will be of benefit to many thousands of Australians.

         —Last Thursday Senator Keeffe asked me whether Minatome Australia Pty Ltd had sought permission to exhibit some yellowcake in Townsville. I undertook to obtain the information. I am advised that Minatome Australia Pty Ltd has a display in its main office in Townsville which contains a very small quantity of yellowcake. On 27 May 1981 Minatome wrote to the Australian Safeguards Office asking what steps the company would need to take to safeguard some 500 grams of yellowcake for display purposes. The Australian Safeguards Office advised that the yellowcake should be exhibited in a locked showcase with a senior staff member responsible for its accountability.

        I must emphasise again that safeguards, including physical protection prescribed by the Australian Safeguards Office, are not designed with health and safety considerations in mind. The Australian Safeguards Office has a wider auditing role. Health and safety considerations are matters for State health authorities. I understand that Minatome has a current licence from the Queensland Health Department to display yellowcake. Of course, yellowcake is not safeguardable material in terms of the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency, although the Australian Safeguards Office accounts for it . As I said last Thursday, yellowcake has a very low level of radioactivity and presents no radiation hazard, particularly when housed in a glass case.

My advice from the Department is that the Taxation Office gives no tapes to the Department of Social Security and that the Department of Social Security gives no computer tapes of beneficiary or pensioner populations for general investigative work. The Department of Social Security provides to the Taxation Office details of tax paid by pensioners and beneficiaries; that is, group certificates.

         —Today we are debating a national crisis : This country's highest level of unemployment on record and this Government's restrictive economic policies which have contributed to this grave situation. Despite all the futile attempts by the Fraser Government to hide the true extent of unemployment in this country, such as getting rid of the politically embarrassing Commonwealth Employment Service figures, one thing it cannot run away from this time is the fact that official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures now show that 482,600 people are out of work in this country. In other words, 7 per cent of the work force, or one in every 14 people, is looking for work. Of course the official figure does not include the estimated 400,000 people who comprise the hidden unemployed. As the shadow Minister for employment , Mr Bob Hawke, has rightly claimed, if they were included the real unemployment figure would be somewhere around 12 per cent. The February jobless total represents an increase of 43,000 over the January figure and a massive increase of over 58,000 or 14 per cent since February of last year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Since this Government came to power unemployment has increased by 41 per cent and the average duration of unemployment has risen from 13 weeks in 1975 to 30 weeks in 1981. This recent upsurge in unemployment is almost entirely due to the penny-pinching, restrictive monetary policies of the Fraser Government and, in particular, the 1981-82 Howard Budget which was designed deliberately to slow down the economy. Employment growth figures confirm that statement. Over the last 18 months the growth in employment has slowed down considerably from 3 1/2 per cent in the September quarter of 1980 to less than 1.6 per cent in the year to January. The prospect of this growth rate falling even further in the months ahead is real indeed.There is no hope at all of employment growth being large enough to soak up any likely future growth in the labour force.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a moment, I suppose, we will hear claims by Government senators that employment growth has been strong over the last few years, as indeed it has. But over the last 18 months the growth rate has slowed down alarmingly. That is what this debate is all about. We are talking about, on the most recent indications, the future of half a million Australians who are officially listed as unemployed , as well as the other 400,000 I mentioned before who do not show up in the official figures. There is no point in Government senators attempting to deny the fact that unemployment has reached a crisis point in this country. They know that the indicators are bad and that there is absolutely nothing they can produce to show that things will become better.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most distressing aspects of the unemployment crisis is the impact it is having on the older age group. Many people have been displaced through technological change. Once they are retrenched, they have very little hope of being re-employed. This group also constitutes a large proportion of the hidden unemployed, as many people are reluctant to admit to being without a job. Of course, this disadvantaged section of the community has been ignored by this Government. The current economic policies of the Fraser Government have given them absolutely no hope at all of regaining their self-esteem. Moreover, the Government continually refuses to face up to the problem being inflicted upon middle-aged and older workers by changes in technology.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the other crisis area. Certainly it has the most dangerous ramifications for the future of Australia. I refer to the very serious and potentially explosive problem of youth unemployment. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that 136,000 teenagers are looking for full time work in Australia. This represents an increase of 7 per cent over February last year and an increase of more than 14 per cent over the life of the Fraser Government. The current teenage unemployment rate is almost four times higher than the adult unemployment rate. In other words, one in every five teenagers is out of work. If Government senators think they can stand in this chamber and say that there is nothing to worry about and everything will be all right, they had better think again. I admit that teenage unemployment fell slightly between January and February but this was largely due to teenagers going back to school or opting out of the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most recent employment growth figures show that teenage employment actually fell by 23,200 in the year to January. In addition, there has been a fall in the teenage participation rate of about one per cent which means, in effect, that the situation is so bad that many teenagers have just given up any hope of ever finding a job. This fall in the participation rate, coupled with a fall of about 10,000 in the population in the 15 to 19 year age group are the only reasons that the fall in teenage job levels has not been translated into an increase in the official teenage unemployment rate. If these trends continue Australia will be faced with the same sort of social upheaval as Great Britain, with riots in the streets and a spiralling crime rate. In Britain increasing numbers of unemployed teenagers have joined extremist organisations and have resorted to looting and gang warfare simply because they have nothing better to do. I am sure that none of us wants to see this happen in Australia but this is what could happen if nothing is done soon to stop the job rot.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another frightening aspect of youth unemployment concerns a finding by Professor Russell Mears, Professor of Psychiatry at Sydney University. He has claimed that unemployment could be a significant cause behind a doubling in the suicide rate among the 15 to 19-year-olds over the last five years. In addition, it has been revealed that unemployed youths have far more health problems than employed youths. The majority of these problems, according to Dr Harris of the Department of Community Medicine at the Flinders University of South Australia, are stress-related illnesses. He has claimed that a study conducted in Ballarat, Victoria, had shown that unemployed people are 12 times more likely to attempt suicide than employed people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another alarming trend is the increasing incidence of prostitution amongst young people, both male and female. Unemployment has forced many young people on to the streets of Kings Cross in Sydney, St Kilda in Melbourne and Hindley Street in Adelaide just so that they can get enough money to pay the rent and, in some cases, to pay for their drinking and drug habits. The Channel 9 program 60 Minutes recently showed how widespread the problem of teenage drinking has become and how unemployment is often the cause of this tragedy. In many cases, gangs of unemployed youths have bashed and robbed innocent people just to get money for their drinking habits. Even in Adelaide people are now afraid to walk the streets at night for fear of being mugged, raped or even murdered. Of course , honourable senators opposite would rather pretend that all this does not happen and that unemployment is not responsible. But it is a fact that teenage prostitution and teenage alcoholism have become rampant through the ineptness of the Fraser Government. We are being plunged into a Clockwork Orange society faster than we think.
       </para>
       <para>
        Shortly we will probably hear Government senators saying that youth unemployment is not confined to Australia. This is certainly true. Recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures show that Australia has one of the highest youth unemployment rates of all OECD countries. Despite this, since 1975 expenditure on manpower programs has decreased in real terms by 44 per cent. I think this is fairly indicative of the degree of this Government's inaction and lack of concern for the problem of youth unemployment. Schemes such as the Community Youth Support Scheme and the Education Program for Unemployed Youth are very useful, of course, and play a most important role. But the fact of the matter is that they do not provide jobs. Despite all the emotive claims about dole bludgers a clear majority of young unemployed Australians want to work; it should be every government's role to ensure that they are given the opportunity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The severe deterioration of employment opportunities for young people over the last year is almost entirely due to this Government's restrictive economic policies. Already the same sort of monetary policies in Britain have caused unemployment in that country to reach 12 per cent. The 1981-82 Howard Budget was deliberately aimed at slowing down the rate of growth in the Australian economy and, therefore, indirectly at slowing down the rate of growth in employment. Because of this thousands of young Australians have been denied jobs. The outlook is certainly not very promising. Recent figures on retail sales, which Government senators have claimed in the past are a very good economic indicator, show that spending is being curtailed. Figures released on 3 March by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in January retail sales increased by only 0.2 per cent over December compared with an increase of 0.7 per cent for the same period a year earlier. In other words, retail sales are now increasing at only a third of the rate in 1981. If this trend continues retail sales in real terms will fall by around 6 per cent in 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has very serious implications for our manufacturing industries and hence employment opportunities generally. Even the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd has recently started massive retrenchments. The Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia is predicting that 1982 will be a very difficult year for metal and engineering industries. According to the most recent review of the Australian economy by the Bank of New South Wales, Australia is facing fragile economic growth over the next 12 months. Even in the mining industry employers are now claiming that employment has reached its peak.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where will the growth in the employment come from? It is not good enough for Ministers of the Government of this country to shake their heads and blame the depressed international economic climate for our problems. It is not good enough for Government senators to blame everything on the Whitlam Labor Government of something like seven or eight years ago; the people stopped listening to that nonsense a long time ago. The young unemployed people of this country want more than just words from the Fraser Government. They want jobs, something that they cannot get from the Government's present array of training schemes or the Government's present economic policies, something the so-called 'beat inflation first' strategy will never give them. The level of unemployment over the next decade will, of course, largely be determined by the economic growth rate. An annual growth rate of around 5 per cent will be needed just to absorb expansions in the labour force and increases in productivity. In other words, a growth rate of at least 6 per cent is required if we are to achieve some fall in the level of unemployment. Under the Fraser Government we now have a growth rate of only about 2 per cent. Some sort of stimulus to the economy is urgently needed before irreparable damage is done. As the editorial in the Australian of 15 January pointed out:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the political and social consequences of widespread and lasting unemployment can be horrendous. Without millions of frustrated German unemployed it is highly unlikely that Hitler would ever have been able to take power. It is at least arguable that, without Northern Ireland's high proportion of jobless, the province's endemic sectarianism would not have been accompanied by the present terrifying blood-letting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The same editorial went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        If unemployment continues for much longer at its present level, it will not only blight the lives of those who are unemployed. It will radically change the nature of our society for the worse. Its elimination must be among the most important of our national goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would suggest to the Government that it accept this advice and devote all its energies towards solving the unemployment crisis in this country instead of engaging in union bashing and introducing such draconian legislation as the Social Services Amendment Bill and the new industrial relations legislation. Perhaps if the Government had not abandoned wage indexation and tax indexation and forced up indirect taxes, interest rates and so on, we would not have had so many wage demands.

         —I rise to enter this discussion on the alleged worsening unemployment situation in Australia which has a particular reference to young people and the restrictive economic policies of the Fraser Government. Any significant measure of unemployment is unacceptable. I do not believe there is any argument about that at all. The argument needs to be directed to the areas that have caused the unemployment situation and how best they can be solved. If we are to serve the purpose of the unemployed-particularly the young unemployed-in this country we had better concern ourselves not so much with constant, often irrelevant and uninformed statistics, but rather with how best we can isolate the causes of unemployment and how best, as a total community, we can contribute to solving those problems.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Before I expand a little on that issue I must say that there were one or two matters that Senator Foreman mentioned in his very responsible address with which I cannot totally agree. He said that during the term of the Fraser Government the unemployment rate has gone up by 41 per cent. As I said, I do not propose this afternoon to talk specifically in terms of statistics, but it is my belief that over the five-year or six-year period of this Government the unemployment rate has increased by more like 20 per cent than 40 per cent. If we follow that through to the circumstances that existed during the three years of the socialist regime, we will see that the unemployment rate increased-as I recall it-by something like 150 per cent. Senator Foreman mentions that we should be talking about the last 18 months. I am quite happy to talk about the last 18 months but I see no necessity so to do. We are dealing with the overall question of unemployment in our society during the terms of all governments, I would assume, not only the Fraser Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Foreman also mentioned the problems associated with technological change. I hope to expand in some measure on that area because I believe it is of very great importance. The challenges that confront Australians, particularly young Australians, as a result of technological change are among the most significant that we as a government and as a people have to overcome. Senator Foreman also mentioned that in February the unemployment situation concerning young people was a little worse than usual. That is so, although somewhat ironically it is not as bad as it was five years ago. There is no doubt that in February it is normal for the unemployment position, particularly concerning young people, to be a significant problem because so many young people are moving into a totally new world for the first time. They are being confronted with challenges that do not seem to exist in the course of one's school life. Certainly, these challenges bear enormous proportions when one moves into the world outside. So on those grounds it is normal that, in terms of employment, February is a month of enormous readjustment. It is a very difficult month, one in which we normally find greater numbers unemployed than at other periods. It is evident more than ever in February that it is necessary for a whole range of skills to be acquired if certain forms of employment are to be achieved. So one finds at around that time of the year a great number of young people in this country looking at the sort of transitional circumstance in which they find themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that when we are discussing a matter such as the unemployment situation-let us face it, we have discussed it at intermittent times over the past three to five years and I am sure that we discussed it during the socialist regime-we should analyse the possible solutions to a problem that is around us and around the rest of the developed world. In most of the developed world the problem is far more significant and tragic than it is in Australia today. Very often, when we look at the history of events we are able to isolate in some measure the causes of those events. If we can isolate the causes of the events then we have some real possibility of establishing a number of solutions. It occurs to me that during the period from 1946 to 1973 there was in this country, by standards anywhere in the world and by standards of history at any particular time, a very low rate of unemployment. In 1972 the unemployment level, as I recall, was something like 2.2 per cent of the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the period from 1973 to 1976 there was an enormous escalation of wages- incidentally, the same threat confronts Australia today-and we saw a significant transfer of Australian resources from the private to the public sector. In that period-again, if I recall the statisics accurately-the number of unemployed in this country increased by 2 1/2 times. From 1976 to the present time, 1982, the unemployment figure has varied marginally up and marginally down. But unfortunately and regrettably it has varied up basically from about 5 per cent of the work force to about 6 per cent in round figures. What has happened is that we have steadied the rate of increase of unemployment very significantly. Having said that, I will not go further and say that that is in any sense sufficient. Let it be said that it is not much more than a trend-a step in the right direction-and it should give us confidence and determination to follow out that tendency.
       </para>
       <para>
        What then can we say of the causes of the unemployment problem that confronts this country along with most other developed countries-indeed, all other developed countries? I would have no hesitation in saying that the basic cause relates to wage explosion and the accompanying inflation. I know that these are not new words; they have been said hundreds of times. Why should they not be said hundreds of times when they are correct? The wage explosion and the accompanying inflation rate are destroying confidence and creating the very unemployment that this important discussion this afternoon is about.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition has tried, I believe, quite desperately to restrain wage rate increases. It has tried by the only two methods, I suppose, that are open to it. There is the example in its own area. It has been participating in a proper and vigorous representation in the courts which decide wage levels, suggesting that until wages in this country are in some way related to the capacity of the economy to pay, we will, of course, be confronted continually by an economic situation which has in its very being the essence of unemployment. The unions regrettably-I say 'regrettably' with a great deal of consideration-have demanded maximum wage levels to the extent, I believe, of irresponsibility. I believe that their demands have made the circumstances of young Australians infinitely worse. Their opportunities of employment cannot be improved by having relatively unskilled young people seeking employment at a wage rate that no one on earth could comply with and remain solvent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real solution, as many people have said and will continue to say, lies in the establishment of a buoyant economy, an economy which seeks to provide employment for all the people available with all their skills and for the simple reason of buoyancy itself, because out of that is bred confidence and a determination to produce and to provide the goods and services that the varying markets within and without this country demand. In relation to the allegedly restrictive economic policies of the Fraser Government, let me say that the growth rate of this country even today is estimated at something in the vicinity of 3 per cent, when the growth rate of the European Community is marginally more than one per cent. So even today, under all sorts of international restrictions and disincentives, the growth rate in Australia is nearly 200 per cent greater than it is, for instance, in the developed countries of Western Europe.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has consistently followed a course of developing energy exploration and research in this country with the establishment of vast infrastructure and incentive to industry across a very wide range. Indeed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development very recently included Australia amongst the most efficient and the most promising economies in the developed world. It would also have said that it was not so promising or literally as efficient as it was perhaps a year or two ago. Which economy on earth is in other than that situation?
       </para>
       <para>
        That there is a steadying in our galloping unemployment rate is borne out by the February figures. I shall not continue statistically for more than a moment or two, but it is interesting to note that even in February 1982 the unemployment level was 7 per cent. In 1981 it was 6.3 per cent; in 1980 it was 6 .7 per cent; in 1979 it was 6.9 per cent; and in 1978-five years ago-it was 7.3 per cent. So, there has been a variant of one percentage point or less over that period. We must in fairness compare those percentages with the unemployment figures in the United States 8.5 per cent, in the United Kingdom of 11.7 per cent and in the countries of the European Community of 10 per cent to 11 per cent. I mention those figures not because they are of themselves extraordinarily satisfactory in any field at all-they are far from satisfactory-but because they indicate that in the context of the Western, developed world the Australian situation is significantly better than that of its fellow economies around the world. In February teenage employment in Australia showed a fall of 9,700. The 12 months to January 1982 saw an increase in employment of 102,000 or 1.6 per cent. Over the two years to January 1982 the increase in employment was, very significantly, 242,000 or 4 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could not participate in this discussion without coming to the second cause of the unemployment situation, which cause surely relates to the problems of unions and management in coping with the advent of highly sophisticated technology in an industrial and commercial world where the cost of labour has been so great that that advent has accelerated to a point beyond the capacity of the community and the educational systems to cope. One of the great challenges which has been accepted by this Government significantly across a very wide range has been to adopt its educational system so that the people who come out of the end of the educational pipeline are equipped with the skills, the capacities and determination that Australian commerce and industry are seeking and urgently need.

        In this field the Government has placed significant emphasis. It has continually increased the area of expenditure and opportunity in technical and further education. It has instigated the important school to work transition program. As from 27 January it reinstigated the Community Youth Support Scheme, after having carried out an in-depth investigation of it in co-operation with the community, and established new guidelines which will tend to place greater emphasis than ever on its capacity to produce from its ranks young people who are able to be gainfully employed in the industry and commerce areas of our community. The Government has greatly increased the opportunities for apprenticeship. Indeed, apprenticeship in Australia today is at the highest level of its history. In 1981-82, 230,000 Australians, including over 200,000 young Australians, will be assisted by manpower training programs.

        Finally, I come back to a significant area which is a cause for concern and which has to be overcome if unemployment is to be confronted and defeated. I am surprised and disappointed that Senator Foreman did not responsibly direct his remarks to this area. It is my complete and absolute view that the greatest contributor to unemployment in this country has been the level of industrial unrest. A measure of uncertainty is developing not only within this country but also without it. A level of uncertainty exists in Australia as a supplier. A measure of doubt is slowly moving into other countries about this country's being a great producer and a great supplier.

         —I believe that it was totally predictable that we would see an effort by the Government to minimise the February unemployment figures. But I believe also that that quite misses the point. The trend in the statistics is unmistakable. We can look at very important aspects of unemployment, such as its average duration, and find that now, in the 15 to 19 year old age group, the average period of unemployment is 25.7 weeks-very close to six months-and the mean is 14.9 weeks. In the 20 to 24 year old age group, many of whom have been unemployed since leaving school, the average period of unemployment is 30.4 weeks. Youth unemployment has risen from June 1975 what it was 32 per cent of the total unemployed to December 1981 when it was 39 per cent of the total unemployed. Since 1975 the 15 to 24 year age group has accounted for over 50 per cent of the total number of people unemployed in Australia. These trends, I insist again, are unmistakably in a direction which indicates that our matter of public importance is perfectly legitimate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        For the whole of the wage indexation period to which Senator Scott referred, the vast majority of workers and their unions claimed only cost of living increases and in most cases received less. Despite this restraint, unemployment grew, inflation grew, standards of living declined and the security of the average worker also declined and, with it there was inevitable industrial unrest . I remind honourable senators that it was the Fraser Government which opposed and finally killed wage indexation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently, only 43 per cent of our school leavers are being absorbed, each year , into the work force. This is happening in the face of the fact that Australia is expecting a gigantic 8.4 per cent increase in its work force participation rates over the next five years. Youth unemployment has always been higher than the average. In 1970, when the general level of unemployment was 1.4 per cent, youth unemployment was 3.2 per cent. In February 1982 when the general level was 7 per cent youth unemployment was 20.1 per cent. These figures show the number of unemployed as a percentage of the labour force in the 15 to 19 year age group . I remind honourable senators too, that we no longer receive any estimates of job vacancies from the Bureau of Statistics.
       </para>
       <para>
        Young women have always been at a greater disadvantage. At present, their unemployment rate is 23.4 per cent as against 17.7 per cent for young men in the same age group. Opportunities for females at every age are circumscribed by the increasingly vicious dual labour market in Australia which has always restricted the range of occupations available to women. When the Australian Statistician takes out his quarterly figures in relation to average award earnings he looks at 2,500 common awards for men and about only 500 for women. The incomes of women reflect this restriction which is generally towards the lower earning end of the scale. Only 12 per cent of full time employed males earned less than $150 a week in August 1980; 27 per cent of full time employed women earned less than $150 per week at the same time. Only 2.6 per cent of the female labour force has trade qualifications as against over 20 per cent of men in the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        A third labour market is developing as the structure of the work force changes. One section is for the mature woman, who, in many cases, has no formal skills but who has acquired a great many skills in the course of running a household and bringing up a family. There is another, much smaller, labour market for junior girls. The traditional junior jobs in shops and factories and banks and offices, which absorbed most female school leavers, have changed drastically, diminished dramatically or disappeared altogether. The majority of jobs available for the girl leaving school at age 15, or even for the more fortunate girl who stayed at school for a little longer, are unlikely to lead to satisfying careers. Some domestic-type work, some assembly-line work, some clerical work and some jobs in the retail trade are available. In many cases, this type of employment has become casualised, at worse, or has become part time , which is marginally better. In August 1980, 14 per cent of part time workers were aged 15 to 19 years and were concentrated in the service, clerical and sales occupational groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        The average part time hours worked over all age groups are about 16 hours per week. But many of the part time workers in the junior age group are still at school. Many of them work very few hours-the average, in fact, is seven hours per week. These mini-jobs can be defended, I suppose, in terms of much needed income and the acquisition of work experience. But, in view of the nature of the jobs-packers, wrappers, waitresses, short-order cooks, cleaners, counterhands and labourers-one wonders just what will be learnt about job satisfaction except , perhaps, that it is a harsh world and that only the fittest survive. In this climate of contracting full time job opportunities for teenagers, the responses of the Government have been inept, wasteful, misguided and tardy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important questions have barely been addressed. If teenage employment is declining, should secondary education be more job-oriented or less? How should the total curriculum respond to the needs of students who would previously have entered the work force without completing Year 10? Is there a case for teaching vocational skills for living and leisure rather than vocational skills for work? If so, who should do the teaching-schools or colleges of technical and further education? Are schools prepared to accept the responsibility to make a genuine effort to broaden the career aspirations of girls and equip them with appropriate skills in order to prevent them from becoming increasingly locked out of the labour market? Furthermore, what really is the point of increasing the job-seeking skills of the young which is a crude and cruel carrot and stick approach, I suggest, when jobs themselves are more and more difficult to get.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is certainly a case for increasing the confidence of young women who tend to be much less visible than their unemployed brothers. But no special schemes have yet been devised for young unemployed women. To the extent that it might be argued that there should be no bias, it is obvious that if the present schemes are not of much use for boys, for girls they are worse than useless. The net increase in training opportunities in all schemes has been insignificant in the last year. The 1981-82 Budget anticipated that the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training would be available to an additional 3,000 apprentices, that there would be 8,000 additional enrolments in pre- apprenticeship schemes and pre-vocational courses and that 8,600 new Special Youth Employment Training Program places would be made available-something like 20,000 positions in all, many of which, I remind honourable senators, would relate to short term employment. This is in the face of 140,000-odd unemployed young people. Scarce skills, where they have been identified in what I suggest is a totally inadequate approach to labour force planning in this country, are in trade areas related to the resources boom and are mostly reserved for males.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the most cynical exercise in the entire Budget last year was the large increase in subsidies to employers for various training programs. In 1981-82, these amounted to about $140m or 70 per cent of the training and youth opportunities program. The biggest increase has been in SYETP under which employers receive subsidies for 17 or 34-week periods to provide young people with work experience. This Program has been strongly criticised by many groups as being tokenistic, not leading to any real jobs, recycling unemployment and being abused by employers as a source of cheap labour for menial and unskilled jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Employment and Training Scheme was instituted initially as a means of assisting women particularly or people who had been out of the work force for any time to acquire skills which would be marketable. It has been allowed to run down over the last years to a point where it is practically useless. I believe that it could certainly be resuscitated especially to assist young women who are discouraged by their past failures and their expectations for the immediate future. Despite the fact that females outnumber males in the unemployed 15 to 19 -year age group, fewer use the CYSS offices on a regular basis, fewer enrol with the Commonwealth Employment Service, some marry very young or have babies to give meaning to their existence, while many just stay at home. A study made of the characteristics of unemployed youth was published in the Journal of Industrial Relations in September 1978. Referring to the girls, the study states :
       </para>
       <para>
        Their previous lack of success, plus the reduced opportunity to look for work, further lowered their confidence and they became caught in a vicious circle, they had to do housework because they were unemployed and they were unemployed because they had to do housework.
       </para>
       <para>
        This country is in urgent need of a comprehensive youth policy with special attention to projects for young women. I have already addressed many of the questions which have yet to be asked, let alone answered. If the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) is genuine in deploring the fact that higher education participation rates are falling, what does he intend to do to make the education system relevant to the youth of the 1980s? Will this society re-order its priorities to make sufficient funds available so that so-called transition programs, or their equivalent, will begin to cater for the vast numbers of young people who are becoming acutely aware of their lack of skills?
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the Government could start by evaluating the schemes which have already been funded to quite an extensive point-about $500,000 has been spent over the last four years in various training schemes-and introduce the concept of accountability of those employers who have already been so heavily subsidised by the Government to such little effect. To my knowledge no employers have been called anything like the equivalent of dole bludgers, nor have employers been persecuted for abusing the schemes. A publication by the Australian Council of Social Service entitled: 'Work, . . . or the want of it' states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . they rob the taxpayer by taking the subsidised young person, using him, teaching him nothing, then dumping him to hire another subsidised trainee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The failures and injustices of SYETP are well known within the bureaucracy, but the Government chooses to ignore them. Nevertheless its inadequacies are used as fresh weapons by bureaucrats to discredit the suggestions of job creation. While there are no job prospects for the vast majority of young people, many of whom are also homeless and without hope, this Government stands condemned of criminal neglect.

         —Everyone in Australia would be gravely concerned at the unemployment level in this country. Honourable senators in this place are equally concerned that something needs to be done about it. Nevertheless, the trend is an international one. Australia's record is comparatively good when compared with those other countries. The figures for the September quarter last year are: The United States, 7.1 per cent unemployed; France, 7.8 per cent; the United Kingdom, 11.4 per cent; Italy 8.2 per cent and Canada, 7.4 per cent; and Australia's unemployment rate was 5.7 per cent. The only two countries with a level of unemployment lower than that of Australia were Japan with 2.2 per cent and West Germany with 4.8 per cent. Since then the unemployment situation has become slightly worse. We are all concerned about that.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am interested to observe the comments that have been made by Senator Foreman. I point out that steps can be taken to alleviate the unemployment position. I cite an example in South Australia where there is a huge deposit of minerals at the Olympic Dam. The South Australian Government, the Tonkin Government, has been endeavouring to pass an indenture Bill which-once it passed the two Houses- would provide job opportunities for many thousands of people in South Australia directly and indirectly as a result of the exploitation of that world-scale mineral deposit. I find it quite strange that the Labor Party Opposition in South Australia has chosen to frustrate the passage of that indenture Bill. Having regard to the significance that Senator Foreman and the Opposition have placed upon the need for development and the provision of jobs in Australia, I hope that that attitude will be reflected very soon in the South Australian Parliament and that that indenture Bill will have a speedy passage through those two Houses. Its passage will mean that the companies concerned will then be able to authorise an expenditure of $100m to continue their exploration and feasibility studies for that project.
       </para>
       <para>
        I sometimes wonder whether we should analyse the unemployment figures. In Australia today something like 36,700 jobs are available. Traditionally one has to agree that of those included among the unemployed many are unemployable. A few years ago I was doing some work on this matter. It was recognised at that time that 20 per cent were unemployable. This included those people who cannot hold a job for longer than a week or so. Another statistic that comes to my mind -this is according to the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs at the time I last had a look at this figure-is that a third of the people who are recorded as unemployed had left their jobs voluntarily for one reason or another. They may have had an aversion to their foreman or the person they worked against, their boss; they may not have got on too well with them. If we add those figures up-it is pretty difficult to be accurate with respect to those percentages-that reduces the unemployment figure considerably.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at another aspect; that is, how many of the remaining unemployed would be willing to take the 36,700 available jobs? I recall a year or two ago when my son was without work. He was waiting to enter the police force. For six weeks it looked as though he might be unemployed, but he regarded it as his responsibility to look for a job. He went to the unemployment office and the first question asked of him was: 'Do you want unemployment benefit?' He said: ' No, I want a labouring job. I am prepared to take anything that is available.' He walked out of that office with disgust because the first thing offered him was a carrot of unemployment benefit.

I just wonder how many people are in that category. They may be waiting to go into a job of their first choice but in the meantime a job may be available that would enable them to survive.

        I recall, I think it was about 18 months ago, talking to an employer, a mechanic, who had a car servicing business in the Adelaide Hills. He told me that he employed a mechanic who proved to be so good that the employer wanted to retain his services by providing him with an increase in wages after he had been with him for one month. However, two months later-three months in all was the period of the mechanic's employment-the employee came up to the boss and said: ' I have to resign'. The employer said: 'Why? Your work is good. I was going to offer you a greater interest in the work that you are doing. This would be reflected in further wage increases for you'. The employee said: 'I am living with three or four other people in a house. It is my turn to go on unemployment benefits'.

In saying that I am painting some sort of picture of the difficulties that we are faced with in Australia today. I look at the situation in New South Wales where even Mr Wran is concerned-quite properly so. As I suggested in Question Time today, the New South Wales situation is interfering with interstate and international trade. Mr Wran said that some power workers had declared war on their work mates in New South Wales and also the community. He said that the Government would not bow to their blackmail and would not be held to ransom. He said that the Government condemned the arrogant attempt by power workers to gain their industrial ends by using their mailed fist. Mr Wran also made a comment about the way in which the workers in these unions were carrying on after having obtained a wage rise of, I think, $35 a week. They then decided to continue their efforts and to subject their fellow workers to even greater trouble. Mr Wran referred also to railway disputes when he said:

        I return to the matter of Olympic Dam in South Australia. To bring that mine up to the full mining stage, it is estimated, will cost the companies concerned about $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So far 32 drilling holes have been completed and a $15m exploration shaft has been sunk to a depth of 260 metres. The projected employment, as at last year, is at least 250 jobs directly associated with that exploration project. I think we have to recognise that all State governments have responsibility to examine all their policies. I think the Federal Government ought to have another look at the proposition I put some time ago. I believe this has a lot of support among my colleagues and others in the community. My suggestion was to provide finance that will enable the States and, of course, the Commonwealth to embark upon capital works programs that are of an essential character and which will contribute to national and State development.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week I believe the Premier of South Australia called for a conference of State Premiers and the Commonwealth to examine the situation that is developing in this country. I think that governments ought to be able to arrange finance at an appropriate interest rate which would not contribute to inflation. Money could be provided for water storage facilities and road works-whether it be the reconstruction of highways such as the Hume Highway or the construction of new roads which are necessary for industrial development in mining areas-and for the development of the tourist industry. I think we also ought to be able to look at the financing of railways that will contribute to mining development as well as other industrial developments such as coal handling facilities, wharves, bridges and power stations. Obviously, something has gone wrong in New South Wales because the State Government ought to have been able to provide more power generation facilities. Perhaps there is some way in which the Commonwealth can assist to repair the damage that has obviously been done over the years. Those are the things I would like to see the Federal Government consider. I would like to see adequate finance provided to enable the States and the Commonwealth to embark upon projects, such as those I have mentioned, which are of a national asset building character, which will provide jobs and which, I hope, will alleviate the unemployment problem in this country.

If the population of Tasmania, man, woman and child, were subject to the same social devastation, the same deprivations, the same lack of finance to obtain the necessities of life, decent food and access to proper health and education facilities-all those things that are suffered by the unemployed at the moment-this chamber would be in an uproar. There would be talk of secession from the federation; there would be a feeling that the federation might be on the verge of collapse. The unemployed are geographically and socially dispersed throughout the nation and this is an occasion for yet another debate in the Senate, but a ho hum feeling seems to prevail.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact we are faced with what I have termed social devastation. The individual suffering is difficult to present to this chamber. I think a socially structured problem is being created, and, as Senator Foreman so eloquently outlined, it should be the real concern of this chamber and indeed of this Parliament. I believe that the allegiance of many Australians to our political and economic social system is being weakened because that system is not delivering the sort of well-being or the standard of living to which they are entitled. Unless we put the worth of every person in the forefront of our policies instead of having some economic goals as our sole guiding light we can look forward to a situation of continuing social disintegration. The anger which builds up in the unemployed not only finds individual expression, as with descent into the drug culture, the increasing suicide rate and the tension generated within households which leads to the breakdown of many families, but also has an overall social dimension where contempt for persons and property, and ultimately our political institutions, as Senator Foreman pointed out, is a very real danger.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is particularly the case with youth unemployment. Approximately one in five of our 15 to 19-year-olds cannot find employment despite their best efforts . In Tasmania about three people out of every ten in that age group cannot find employment and the duration of unemployment is becoming longer and longer. This is a point which was well made by Senator Giles in her contribution to this debate. The social security system devised by this Government is very ill- matched to the growing social problems that are emerging. It is based on an unemployment benefit which was originally intended as a short-term maintenance measure to see a person through a relatively sporadic short period of unemployment. Extended periods of unemployment were not thought of, yet the distress caused by extended periods of poverty is very real. We find that the average duration of unemployment for 15 to 19-year-olds is 18 weeks. For persons 20 years and over it is some 36 weeks, that is 9 months. The financial constraints on a household created by extended unemployment is not in any way ameliorated by the type of social security system support that we offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The social security system is ill-designed to meet the fact that in the case of a family breakdown situation prevailing in society, exacerbated by unemployment creating insecurity and tensions within the household, there is less readiness, on the part of families, to provide the support needed for the young unemployed, the young school leaver. Whilst our social security system is premised on the basis that accommodation, food, health care and allowance for travelling whilst seeking employment, which is an expensive pursuit, are available from within the family, the social situation is quite different. Many young school leavers find themselves living and existing outside the family situation and therefore the support that we offer them should be much more than it is. But with the Government party room full of Senator Jessop's type I expect that that response will not be forthcoming. For a senator to say that 20 per cent of the unemployed in Australia are unemployable is to say that 96,000 of our fellow Australians-as officially tallied let alone the hidden unemployed-are lacking in skills. But more than that, there is an overtone of their being so socially inadequate that they are unemployable. To think that that is the response from the Government party room, from the Government honourable senator put up to take part in this debate, is indeed frightening. However, it is not surprising.
       </para>
       <para>
        An extremely good paper was put out by the Confederation of Australian Industry and the National Employers Industrial Council-not the most radical body in Australia-in August 1978. Concerning youth unemployment, it stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        For far too long we as a nation have conveniently ignored the plight of the young. However, it is strongly suggested that by our continued failure to recognise and understand the long-term consequences of continuing to neglect the employment problems confronting this generation, we are establishing the groundwork for future social and economic instability, disruption and dislocation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was suggested by those bodies that those in government as well as industry leaders, trade union officials and educationalists find, in a common meeting, an appreciation and understanding of the social and economic changes taking place and of the impact those changes are having on the employment position of youth. Those bodies-the Confederation of Australian Industry and the National Employers Industrial Council-asked all groups within the Australian community which had a concern to come together to try to come up with a rational response to youth unemployment. Yet the Government's reaction, only over the last fortnight, to Mr Bob Hawke's plea in the other place to set up a joint committee-a plea which he made in the late 1980s-to examine these problems was rejected out of hand. The proposal to set up a bipartisan joint committee of this Parliament, with representatives from both chambers is the sort of environment which we all know from experience is conducive to rational discussion and well-considered proposals coming forward-was rejected by this Government. That is not surprising ; it is in line with the Government's following through of the razor gang's recommendation that the Commonwealth Employment Service no longer obtain statistics on the local impact of unemployment. This, as I will argue later, would be extremely important in any rational attempt to combat unemployment. We must look for positive policies to create employment, not those which merely try to ameliorate the effects of unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly the Labor Government, in 1983 and beyond, will take such steps as are necessary and would be expected from a Labor Government to ensure that programs are undertaken which will help to create and generate jobs. This is the task which as a community we must set ourselves. I was pleased to see that Senator Jessop, apparently with ill effect, claims to have been advocating within his party room public capital works. There is no doubt that public capital works have the largest multiplier effect of any form of public expenditure on economic activity and employment. For example, increased spending on public housing would stimulate a depressed industry and depressed regions, begin to reduce housing commission waiting lists and contribute to easing pressure on housing prices. There would be no difficulty in identifying other socially responsible spending programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true that as the economy would expand under a Labor Government's expansionary fiscal and monetary policies there would be a slight inflationary effect. That is why I agreed, in the course of Senator Jessop's remarks, that in order to combat that inflationary trend within the community we would need a proper package of anti-inflationary measures. Whereas this Government pursues an unjust, anti-inflationary policy which is utterly and absurdly ineffective-it combats inflation by raising the price of health and so on-the Australian Labor Party, as a substitute for that and as part of the package of anti-inflationary measures, would seek acceptance within the Australian community of a comprehensive, equitable, voluntary prices and incomes policy. I believe that by that means we might have, as I say, such an equitable and comprehensive prices and incomes policy that some of the fears of Senator Jessop, of escalating wage payments, within our community could be met.

        In the few moments remaining to me I would not want to leave Senator Martyr with the obvious retort: 'Oh well, there goes Senator Tate on behalf of the Labor Party again talking about capital expenditure with all the consequences that that may have within the economy'. Indeed, that is not a sufficient solution to the problem of job generation. I commend to the Senate a book which has been published only this week-certainly I hope that Government Ministers will have a look at it-entitled 'Job-Generation' by Tom O'Brien. In very simple terms the book outlines the following proposal:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a government sponsored community development program intended to activate local communities to generate new jobs within their own areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hence the need for the CES statistics on the impact of unemployment in particular areas. He proposes the formation of a community enterprise foundation based on local government areas with local government sponsorship, but with a very real input from the local business community. We would be creating a situation in which small business in particular-which is the real generator of jobs within our economy-had access to what might be termed 'a multi-dimensional management consultancy operation'. That is a large term for a situation wherein within each local community one would have a local small business, in particular -entrepreneurs-in a community enterprise foundation group interacting with community leadership from local government, and State and Federal government people with their expertise having an input. The group would enable small business not only to become more aware of the job opportunities which are represented by the job statistics at the moment in a fairly negative way but also-this is contained in Tom O'Brien's proposal-to have access to venture finance. The proposal would also open up the trading banks to a more realistic apportioning of their funds to the creation of job opportunities within the small business sector. I regret very much that I am not able to detail that proposal. I read it only at lunch time. The book has only just become available. I believe the proposal has within it the seeds for a very positive co-operative effort with private enterprise and local communities to create jobs within local districts. I believe that with that sort of support, plus Federal Government spending on capital works and a more compassionate responsive attitude by government to unemployment, we will reach a stage where this sort of matter of public importance will not be necessary in the future.

         —It is with great pleasure that I represent the Australian Democrats in the debate on this matter of public importance. Honourable senators will note that I am speaking in this debate and not Senator John Siddons, who has pursued this policy area since he came into this place with tremendous energy, experience and ability. It is only because of the other very heavy policy areas bearing on him-that is, industrial relations and the economy generally-that I now have assumed this portfolio responsibility in which I will do my poor best compared with him. However, it is an area of interest to me. The Australian Democrats believe that any government that obstructs the basic human drive to work which has been inculcated into our young , be it natural or not, over many generations and which is a major part of our social and cultural traditions, does so at our peril. That is the basic major consideration behind any debate of this kind. It implies, therefore, that any government has a basic responsibility to the people of a country trained in that tradition to provide employment opportunities for all its citizens who may wish to work. Indeed, that is basic to Australian Democrat policy. I think we listed that as one of the major considerations-indeed, the primary consideration-of our economic policy. We believe that it is with reason. It is something to which the community would subscribe and which all reasonable citizens would support.

         —No. It is the policy which-unlike Liberal Party policies-was determined by ballot about four years ago but which has been modified and adjusted since. Our policies are constantly under review. But Senator Peter Baume makes a very good point. Nothing has happened on the Government side. The Government has done nothing whatsoever to ameliorate unemployment that would cause us to change our policy. It only emphasises that it becomes increasingly necessary with the passing years of Liberal Party inadequacy in this direction. It has become increasingly obvious that this Government has been not only unable but also apparently unwilling to provide the opportunity to get Australians back to work. I think that is one of the most serious indictments that can be made against it.

        Unemployment statistics continually rise and have risen again recently. The January 1982 figures show that 6.5 per cent of the population is unemployed. The figure of 72,800 for youth unemployment-or, as Senator Tate mentioned slightly more than one-fifth of the population -or 21.2 per cent of the total youth employment potential is, I think, a gross indictment not only in economic terms, although of course in the area of unemployment we have a billion dollar economic problem, a billion dollar millstone around the neck of the national economy, but also in social terms. It is an appalling consequence. It is an interesting figure-one in five. We have created, through our actions and inabilities, a fifth column of considerable potential. We have said that four out of five young people who have passed through the educational process for good or for bad are entitled to become a part of lawful and socially acceptable objectives. We have said that one in five is not to have that opportunity. By failing to provide reasonable national facilities for retraining and returning confidence to the young unemployed who have never worked we have almost said that this one in five discrimination is a sort of permanent thing in the society.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is why I agree with Senator Tate. I find it deeply disturbing that Senator Jessop should get up in this chamber and say that 20 per cent of the work force appears to be unemployable. I suggest that that statement is an indictment of the system rather than those people. I do not believe that what he has said is true. If it were true I think he and the Government would need to look very carefully at their objectives and at their rationale to see whether or not they had some responsibility for that situation or some duty to do something effective about it, which they are not doing now and show no signs of doing. It is not good enough for a government senator to get up here and merely say that that is the situation as though this huge number of Australians were a sub-class or separate class to whom we have no responsibility whatsoever. I do not know what Senator Jessop thinks the eventual fate of these people should be. Does he think they should continue to exist in a state of limbo and do nothing? That will not happen. Of course it will not happen. As in other countries, if our young people are not given the opportunity to take part in socially acceptable objectives sooner or later somebody will come to them and use their natural drive to support something in a wrong and improper sense. That is what happened in Germany and in Italy when the dictatorships arose. It was the young to whom Hitler and Mussolini went and said: 'Here. They give you nothing'. Their Governments, like our present Government said: 'Here we are. We have something to give you. We give you hope for the future. We give you new objectives'. If we are fool enough to think that what happened under those Governments could not happen here we are very stupid indeed. Of course, this does not apply only to the young.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cannot enter into a debate like this without saying that there is another area of unemployment which I find even more traumatic. People in their forties and fifties have come to me. They have worked well for this country all their lives and have no reason whatsoever to be regarded as unemployable. In many cases they have lost their jobs, to the regret of their employers, and cannot get another job. They want another job. Not only do they not have a job but they know only too well that they will never get one. These people in their 40s and 50s should be a major source of concern to this country, and the growth of bitterness amongst those people also should be of concern to all of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is also rather serious that it is becoming increasingly difficult for young people to get full time jobs. Therefore, they tend to go for part time jobs. This is creating, in my experience and from what I have heard back from the community, a very unhealthy situation. Because of the competitive nature of the job market most of the new teenage part time workers are employed in menial jobs. They are literally becoming the untouchables of our society. Anything is good enough for them. They are the people who do such monotonous jobs as packing , wrapping, cleaning and washing windows. Sometimes they are lucky enough to get mentally elevating jobs as cashiers, sales assistants, waitresses and, of course , often enough as labourers. These jobs contain virtually no training aspect. I think this is one of the serious things about them. They are not jobs that form the beginning of a career path.
       </para>
       <para>
        The young people who are forced into them through sheer economic necessity and who are forced to accept whatever conditions an employer wants to put on them I feel cannot be regarded as being very different from those who are unemployed. This has an effect on their view of the future and the ability of the society which has nurtured and educated them. I think it is reasonable that they should ask and expect that society to give them what they want within reason if they are prepared to work for it. We are creating an unhealthy situation in this country in which it is increasingly possible for young people to be exploited as cheap labour. That is, indeed, happening to an enormous extent. Evidence has also shown that as well as being particularly exploitable, young people are most vulnerable to the effects of unemployment because school leavers who have no history of employment will in most cases not even be considered for a job. This is happening right up to the highly qualified people in the community. Most of last year's graduates in social work, who worked for four years in universities to get their degree, have not yet found a job. I know this because my daughter is one of them. Fortunately she was trained previously as a nurse and she has gone back to that career. It is useful work but she did, after all, do four years study to be a social worker. As far as this Government is concerned that is of no value, no importance and no consequence; it is good enough for those people merely to do anything else. Most of the ones who have had no alternative training, I imagine, will soon be working as waitresses, cashiers and checkout girls in supermarkets. That is what the Government has wished on this society.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because young unemployed people have little money their usual sources of entertainment are often unavailable. This is not right. There is no reason, in an affluent society such as ours, for these people to be forced into inevitable constraints. Because they are not given any opportunity to find work, life is made miserable and uncomfortable for them in every possible way. Their self- confidence is destroyed through this process. They lose contact with their friends and boredom and frustration set in. This leads to drug and alcohol abuse and, in the extreme, attempted suicide or, in some cases, unfortunately, actual suicide.

       <para>
        In our society acceptance as an adult is based to a large extent on financial independence. Our media constantly drum into young people all the things they should want to have. I do not necessarily agree with the consumer society, but I think it is very wrong to have made those points to our young people and then suddenly at the end of their schooling for them to find that they are deprived of those things which they felt they reasonably had a right to expect. Due to economic conditions prevailing in the country some young people are forced to survive on $36 a week, and adults on not much more. This presents and creates further difficulties, and for some can create actual poverty.

       <para>
        As recently as last week the Australian Democrats met with a delegation from the Under-18 Income Campaign. I was not involved but Senator Chipp assisted in the launching of a publication that those unemployed youths put together. In the publication they listed their requests which included increasing their benefits from the present $36 week to the adult rate. As a result of discussions with these young people Senator Chipp, on behalf of the Democrats suggested that perhaps with the Australian Labor Party we could introduce a private member's Bill somehow to find some way to substantially increase the benefit. It is too low; it has not been increased and it is causing actual hardship. I do not think it is right and proper that it should do so. Alternatively, the Senate could take the initiative and pass a motion requesting the House of Representatives to introduce such a Bill, which is certainly by far the better way this could be done, if indeed we could achieve that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Jessop mentioned 36,700 available jobs. Are they really available to the young people who cannot get work? Of course they are not! I have talked to people who have these jobs available. A lot of these jobs require experience, and there is no way in the world in which young people can apply for them and hope to get them. Many young people have in fact already applied for them and have been turned down. Senator Jessop castigates these young people as being unemployable because they cannot get jobs. He thinks they are happy enough to continue on the dole, but I do not believe that. I believe those ones are very much the minority and I believe there are young people who have rationalised their position perhaps to the extent to which they believe they are happier on the dole, which is a very different thing. In other words, their self-confidence and desire to do something have been destroyed so effectively by the system that they no longer want to try. Do we abandon them completely in the future? No, of course not. Even these people might respond to an imaginative, flexible, compassionate and voluntary program designed expressly to help them. This is what we do not have in this country, in spite of the tremendous efforts mustered by individual communities and people in the Community Youth Support Scheme area. I commend them in every possible respect. But we should have a national program in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe most young people want a job and not this continuing situation in which their self-respect is continually eroded until the time comes when they no longer have the confidence to apply for jobs. They believe they will be told yet again that the job has gone to somebody with work experience. I think we can identify at this stage two major problems. One is a lack of self-esteem and self -confidence amongst these young people. The second is the difficulty in getting work if they have not even had work experience. This becomes a catch-22 situation indeed. I have discussed the matter with many young people of this kind in drop-in centres throughout Australia but mostly in New South Wales. I have met with informal groups and also with individuals, and they confirm these two problems and others. Another problem is the lack of confidence in the work situation generally and the lack of ability to compete with prospective co- workers who already have work experience. This may be a key to Senator Jessop's complaint that these people do not stay in jobs very long. Many of the young people I spoke with were, as it were, pre-programmed for failure. They believe that even if they get a job they may well fail at it. Such feelings, of course, tend to be self-fulfilling. I think everyone of us would know or would have heard of instances in which this is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        What then, in the view of these young people, is the answer? I do not have time to deal with this aspect to any extent, but basically they need some work in which they could be involved with other young people like themselves. I believe one would have to be very cynical indeed not to believe that most young human beings feel they would like to be of use and value. This is a mainstay of human self-esteem and it is an element in this situation. The so-called young unemployables want to feel they are doing something of value and that the work they are engaged in is a meaningful contribution to the country. If we neglect this latent appeal to patriotism and a sense of purpose I believe indeed we are fools. As I said, if the society does not use these drives, sooner or later some anti-social group will use them.

         —I have been asked to speak in this debate, I suppose, because I am probably the only one here who has recently been unemployed, and I cannot say that that was totally unexpected. Anyway, I found congenial employment about 12 months ago. I have a great deal of sympathy for people who are out of work. I think it should go without saying that I would have had a great deal of sympathy for them even if I had not had that experience . Unemployment happens frequently, and it has always happened. I think I should begin my remarks by making five points about the current unemployment figures which seem to have been some of the basis for this debate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Firstly, the movement in full time unemployment in February indicates an easing in the labour market. Nevertheless, too much emphasis should not be placed on the figures for one month. February, along with December and January, is traditionally a high month for unemployment due to seasonal factors. The figures should be considered in the context of the slowing but still solid growth in employment which has occurred in recent months. Over the 12 months to January 1982 employment increased by 1.6 per cent. The full time employment rate of 7 per cent was higher than the rates recorded in February 1981, 1980 and 1979, but lower than the rate of 7.3 per cent recorded in February 1978. I hope that Senator Foreman, in particular, takes note of that. The fourth point is that the increase in full time unemployment during February 1982 occurred amongst adults, but there was a lower than expected decline in teenage unemployment. Over the 12 months to February 1982 the increase in adult full time unemployment was 37,200 or 16.1 per cent. This compares with the rise in teenage full time unemployment of 8,900 or 7 per cent over the same period.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those five points and an understanding of what they mean are absolutely essential to the conduct of this debate. The Government must reject solutions which will empty the Treasury or run the country into graver deficit than it is in now. For the Opposition, however, the whole subjet is timeless. It is an everlasting essay. It is scarcely an original subject for a matter of public importance as it has been gone over so often under other headings in recent weeks, months and years. Ever since 1975 the Opposition has said the same thing time and again. The Opposition is asserting once again that the Fraser Government is useless. But it never gives any reasons for this assertion. In two Houses I have heard the same argument time without number and still no reasons are given. There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Scott and Senator Jessop, in their very worthy contributions to the debate, answered every one of these assertions, as Government speakers always do. Senator Tate said it was rubbish to generalise. What on earth has the Opposition been doing but generalising? He joined Senator Foreman-this was a marriage of hyperbole and exaggeration if ever there was one-in saying that national crisis could be linked to social devastation. What sort of gross exaggerations are these? But we are accustomed to hearing such gross exaggerations every day.
       </para>

        Let us look at a particular aspect of what the Opposition is saying. Why do we have darkened corridors in this building today? We have them because of the actions of a few militant trade unionists in New South Wales. We know that their actions have grave consequences for their fellow unionists. The militants do not care about the consequences of their actions; they do not care that they cause unemployment among fellow unionists or dislocation and inconvenience for everyone. Some unionists do care. I will quote what the Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Union in New South Wales and Mr Wran have said. They back up- no matter how the Opposition may not like it-what the Government has been saying for years. Mr Joe Thompson of the Vehicle Builders Employees Union warned that the present crisis would have disastrous consequences for New South Wales. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Those power workers in dispute should remember that a lot of fellow unionists are going to suffer if zoning is introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Wran, in an attack which the Australian Financial Review described as savage, warned the New South Wales Parliament that, unless the damaging bans and limitations were lifted immediately by the unions, the State's three million workers faced a four day working week starting on Monday. He has made attacks on other unions for the selfishness which brings about difficulty and dislocation for all citizens and causes unemployment among their own number. What sort of effect is this dispute having in this country today? Mr Wran and Mr Thompson have indicated the effect on the whole employment situation. Senator Scott made the point very clearly that these irresponsible actions have a drastic effect on the employment situation in Australia. The final word, of course, on trade union irresponsibility generally in these matters comes from another oracle who is vastly experienced. I refer to Mr Bob Hawke who presently enjoys a position in the other place. He has said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . I have made it clear that, at times, the actions of unions have not been wise.
       </para>
       <para>
        At another time he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . that doesn't mean that I endorse every strike that takes place. Some of them are silly . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        At another time he stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make my position quite clear. There is no doubt that some strikes are not justified . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally-this is the prince of quotations-Mr Hawke said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, let me concede that at times I believe unions do some bloody stupid things and I have said so publicly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The words I have quoted came from people who know what they are talking about. It is quite clear to me that Mr Hawke, Mr Wran and Mr Thompson are all experienced in the labour movement and the trade unions. They know the drastic consequences that the actions of irresponsible trade unionists are having on the total situation in Australia. They are having an effect on the unemployment rate .

        I now make a few points about Senator Foreman's contribution. He accused the Government of getting rid of the embarrassing Commonwealth Employment Service figures. The only reason the Government is using figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics is that they are far more accurate and representative of the exact situation. The CES figures gave a completely distorted view of the employment situation. I use the word 'employment' advisedly. I did not say ' unemployment' situation quite deliberately. Senator Foreman talked about the hidden unemployment figures. Of course they are hidden. That is a good word to use because if there be such a thing as hidden unemployment-I am not saying that there is not-not a great deal of hard evidence is available about it. What evidence there is, once again, is subject to gross exaggeration for quite obvious political reasons. Senator Foreman quoted Mr Hawke as an authority. I too have quoted Mr Hawke as an authority but not in the same vein as Senator Foreman. He then accused the Government of being penny-pinching. He referred to the penny-pinching policies of the Fraser Government. This Government is so penny-pinching that it has kept up the level of unemployment benefit to those who should be in just receipt of them and it has kept up the Community Youth Support Scheme in spite of a lot of opposition from its back bench. I am not entirely in favour of CYSS but others in the party have a different idea and it is their writ that carries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Everything that the Government could possibly do to ameliorate unemployment has been done. Yet we are accused of penny-pinching and lack of generosity. If that is an implied attack on the Government's monetary policy I have to say that that is the salvation of this country. If we succumb to the temptation of using the printing press to get ourselves out of trouble we will be in the same difficulty as the Whitlam Government was in and we will fall the same way. Honourable senators should make no mistake about that. It is the greatest achievement of the Fraser Government to resist that temptation. Senator Foreman said that we have had a slow down in employment, that there is no hope of growth and that this situation will lead to vast youth unemployment. He said also that it could lead to looting and gang warfare. I do not know where endemic sectarianism came into it, but I think at one stage that was the point he was trying to make. Of course once again, these are typical and gross exaggerations. There is nothing like that in this country. Unless people on the other side are prepared to stir the pot there will be nothing like it. Honourable senators on the Opposition side know it as well as I do. The situation in this country is nothing like the situation in others. Indeed, I keep on saying that this country is far more fortunate than elsewhere. This is not to neglect or reject the situation of the unemployed.

        Senator Giles raised some matters, the most important one being about a proper concern at the lack of opportunity available for youth. I point out to Senator Giles-again she may not like to hear it-that there is some truth in the assertion that large numbers of married women who are employed deny the opportunity of jobs to their daughters. I am not saying that this is the whole story; it is certainly a part of it. I understand the necessity for some married women to work. I wanted to bring some sanity into this debate, in reply to the scaremongering of the Opposition. The preliminary employment statistics for February 1982 are worrying but they are no cause for panic as the Opposition is trying to suggest. The unemployment figures for February show by no means a satisfactory result but it is unwise to place too much emphasis on one month's figures. I move:

         —The large claim that is made by Senator Evans for his Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments ) Bill is that it constitutes the only presently realistic solution to what he describes as the institutional problems inherent in our present Constitution. He referred to it as 'a principled solution to the problem of 1975'. The Bill proposes an elaborate and drastic reordering and restructuring of the Australian constitutional system. If adopted, the proposal would involve shifts of a fundamental kind in our institutions of representative and responsible government which would become entrenched in our political system.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Evans's Bill, if it were successful, would result in a major change in the whole power structure of the parliamentary system resulting in a major downgrading of the Senate and a House of Representatives in which the government of the day would be either an all-powerful government and immune from accountability to the people for its full term if a stable system were to continue or, if stable majorities were not available, a weak government which would have to bargain from day to day for its continued survival. I think we can all understand and support the need to have more stability and continuity in our political environment. However, Senator Evans's Bill offers no guarantee of achieving this. Under this Bill the proposed fixed term is one for three years only. In fact, the average length of time between elections since 1949 has been two years, four and a half months. The Bill would at most add only an extra seven or eight months to the average parliamentary term. Even this is not certain, since the Bill would still allow early elections to be held. The amendment foreshadowed by Senator Evans, that a parliament elected after such an early election would only serve out the remainder of the fixed term, would mean that where an early election is held it would be followed immediately by yet another early election. In effect, early elections may well be multiplied.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Government's view the real answer to achieving more continuity and stability may well be a maximum four-year term for the Parliament, as was adopted by a two-thirds majority in the recent State referendum in New South Wales. It has been ably argued that the present term of three years is too short for good government. Governments are inhibited from long term planning and have not the time to see through their programs and their effects. The needs of modern, complex societies are such that programs need time to bear fruit. If parliaments could run to four years as a maximum then, on average, parliaments would be likely to last more than three years, even under our existing provisions. In reality, Senator Evans's Bill is not about more stable government and fewer elections-whatever he might say on that point. Its real purpose is to offer what turns out to be a partisan solution to the so-called problems of 1975 . It is an attempt to deal with these problems by a drastic reduction in the power of the Senate. People, both inside and outside Parliament, therefore need to understand that Senator Evans's Bill is not really concerned about fixed terms as such.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now return to the whole discussion of the fixed term concept. The best example of a fixed term parliament is provided by the Constitution of the United States of America. Indeed, Senator Evans has followed a notable feature of that example in determining that an election will be held on a certain day every three years. However, two major features of that system, of course, are not dealt with in this Bill. Firstly, the United States Constitution makes absolutely no provision for the dissolution of Congress during its term. It is pertinent to note that congressional elections occur every two years. Secondly, the United States Constitution provides also for a fixed term Executive and the election of the Executive by a separate vote of the people. The proponents of engrafting a fixed term parliament on a system of responsible government are faced with what I believe to be an insoluble dilemma. On the one hand, they are obliged to evolve some provisions to resolve a potential conflict between the Executive and the body which creates it and to which it is responsible -that is, the parliament. On the other hand, the more attempts are made to provide a resolution for that conflict the less the result contains the elements of the fixed term concept.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the Australian Constitution with its powerful Senate the dilemma is even more acute. Indeed, Senator Evans's odyssey on this subject is a good example of this dilemma. First of all, Senator Evans had to provide for some method of resolving the conflict in the House of Representatives and he chose the no confidence procedure. He then had to provide for the conflict between the houses and he retained the double dissolution procedure in a modified form. However, he then discovered that a government which desired an election could easily manipulate these provisions in order to achieve its purpose. Senator Evans now proposes to build in what he calls a 'disincentive' for a government otherwise bent on an early election. The so-called disincentive is that a parliament elected after an early election will only serve out the remainder of the fixed term. However, a government bent on an election to resolve its conflict with either house of the parliament-the conflict may be in either House-is not likely to be deterred by this ingenuous proposal.

         —The word is ingenuous. I am quite clear on that. The result of the so-called disincentive would only be more elections, which it is the very purpose of the fixed term concept to avoid. If Senator Evans really wanted to ensure a fixed term for the House of Representatives he would have to completely emasculate the powers of the Senate, not only over money Bills but also in respect of all its legislative powers and, if retained at all, retain the Senate as some form of antipodean House of Lords, a solution which is not politicaly feasible. On the other hand, if Senator Evans wanted to provide for all the possible conflicts which could arise between a government in the House of Representatives, he would have to provide for so many occasions when a Prime Minister can seek an election that any concept of a fixed term would disappear. A glaring omission from this Bill in this respect is that it provides no guarantee that a government would be able to secure supply in the House of Representatives. A government could be put in the position of having to negotiate quite unreasonable terms from a minority in that chamber which was not prepared to install the Opposition in government or itself face the risk of an election. Under Senator Evans's Bill only a formal vote of no confidence, which may be withheld for all sorts of reasons, would free the Governor-General to dismiss the Prime Minister or dissolve the House of Representatives if supply were not able to be secured from that House.

        The fixed term concept could, on the evidence of the American experience, produce a situation in which a government could not implement the program upon which it had been elected by the Australian people. It could produce a situation in which there would be 'lame duck' administrations which were unable to grapple with national problems in an effective way. They would be 'lame ducks' because, while their tenure of office would run on, their capacity to act would be crippled unless an appeal to the electorate were possible. When all the possibilities are seriously considered rather than glossed over, it becomes clear that the adoption of a fixed term concept would be, as one political scientist has observed, a leap into, if not the dark, then at least one of the twilight zones of constitution making.

         —It was Professor Colin Hughes. I understand that his view has not been published. The more one studies the concept the more it becomes apparent that it is irreconcilable with the system of responsible government. That is not surprising because such a system demands that there should be no basic conflict between the parliament and the Executive and that if such a conflict cannot be resolved within the parliament it must be resolved by the people. The history of parliamentary democracy clearly shows that this method, although not foolproof, is the most satisfactory system which has been devised. In its 1959 report the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review stated that the right of the Crown to dissolve the House of Representatives before it had served its full term is necessary for the maintenance of responsible government. Sir Owen Dixon underlined and elaborated this principle in a speech entitled ' Government under the American Constitution' given in 1944, immediately after returning to Australia from the position of Australian Ambassador to Washington. He was in a very unique vantage position to observe the differences-he was very interested in the differences-between the Australian system and the American system. He applied his great intellect and experience in considering these differences. In his conclusion he stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We, under our conception of democracy, so far from separating the executive and the legislature, insist on the dependence of the Cabinet upon Parliament. We insist too that if a difficulty arises between the executive government and Parliament, it shall be resolved by an appeal to the people, and we place on the representative of the Sovereign the responsibility of saying whether the case is one for the dissolution of Parliament and a general election. This we can do because we have proudly preserved the monarchy as the apex of our constitutional system. In the United States the President is elected for four years-a fixed period. Congress cannot be dissolved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fixed term rule must, if it means anything, involve destroying the power of the Governor-General-which this Bill does-acting in accordance with recognised conventions and practices to dissolve the House of Representatives. This would remove the means by which relations between the electorate, parliament and the government can, consistently with the principles of responsible government, be adjusted.
       </para>
       <para>
        There remains only one other argument in support of the fixed term concept and that is the objection that a Prime Minister can obtain an unfair advantage by calling a snap election. This argument is based on the theory that a Prime Minister always has an election in his pocket. However, this theory does not square with what Governors-General have said on the topic and overlooks the realities of the situation. Any Prime Minister has to justify an early election not only to the Governor-General but also to the electorate, an experience which two Premiers of South Australia have learned to their cost over the last decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, let us look at the so-called problem in the Federal sphere. Since the end of World War II there have been six Federal elections that could be described as early elections. Three of those were double dissolutions to resolve the deadlock between the two houses that occurred in 1951, 1974 and 1975. The early election that was sought and granted in 1963 was based on the need for a more secure majority than that provided by one member at a time that was regarded as one of international crisis. The remaining elections were in 1955 and 1977. A number of factors were relied upon in each of these cases but in each case the Prime Minister, in advising the Governor-General, relied upon bringing the Senate elections and the House of Representative elections back into phase following the dislocation of elections for those houses brought about by double dissolutions in 1951 and 1975. As I have said, in all of those cases sound reasons had to be advanced by a Prime Minister for seeking a dissolution. The fact of the matter is that there may be good reasons-other than simple political advantage-why a government may wish to have a fresh commission from the electors or why an early election should be required.

I am suggesting some reasons which may be regarded, for the purpose of this argument, as academic. I have said that there may be good reasons. I mention some that come readily to mind: Where party defectors seek to install another government without an election; where the House of Representatives is unstable or unworkable; where the Government's policies are being continually frustrated by the parliament-in either House; where the Government wishes to seek the mandate for some new important measure or policy; where there is a gross and patent breach of the law which cannot be dealt with adequately by the judicature, or where there is other conduct amounting to a gross and patent breach of the basic provisions of the constitutional system. I do not believe that I am alone in thinking that the advantages to the democratic system of being able to have an early election may have been underrated while the advantages to the party in power of being able to call a snap election have been exaggerated.

         —I have dealt with the fixed term parliament concept. I turn now to the objects of Senator Evans's Bill. The real thrust of the Bill is not its fixed term aspect but its attack on the powers and status of the Senate. The changes proposed in the Bill include abolishing the Senate's power under section 53 of the Constitution to block Bills appropriating revenue or moneys or imposing taxation, abolishing the existing powers of the Governor-General to dissolve the House of Representatives under section 5 of the Constitution before the expiration of three years and abolishing any discretion the Governor-General has to dissolve both Houses where there is a deadlock under section 57. Under the Bill the abolition is not limited to appropriations for the ordinary annual services of the Government, commonly referred to as Supply. All financial measures passed by the House of Representatives would become law in 30 days, whatever the Senate might say or do.

        The foreshadowed amendment that Senator Evans unveiled last Thursday constitutes a retreat from this extreme position but the Senate would still be denied the power to reject what he calls 'crucially important appropriation and taxation measures the passage of which is indispensible to a government's capacity to continue to govern'. That is a quote from the statement Senator Evans tabled in the Senate in the shortest speech that he ever made or is likely to make. It is a very significant statement. I am sorry to have to provoke him to lengthy explanations which no doubt he will give in the Senate on a number of future occasions, but I have a number of questions in relation to the statement. The first is: What is meant by it? What are the criteria to decide what is crucial? Who is to decide? Is it to be the government of the day? Is it intended that the High Court should decide after the event whether a Bill is one that the Senate could amend or reject? It certainly appears to me that if a provision of such magnitude is contemplated in our Constitution the only appropriate body to decide that would be the High Court. But, as Senator Evans said, we will see. We will no doubt hear from him as well with respect to those problems. I mentioned this because it really is a vital issue. As proposed by him, it is a very vague issue which needs a great deal of further development.
       </para>
       <para>
        In whatever form this provision is to be expressed, the thrust of the Bill, with its refinements, is directed against the Senate. If the Bill were to become part of the Constitution it would be possible for a government with a secure majority in the House of Representatives to hold on to office for its full term even in extreme circumstances that might otherwise require an early election. Such circumstances might exist, for example, where a Government was acting in gross and patent breach of basic principles of the constitutional system or in admitted or proved breaches of the law. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that a government in control of the House of Representatives could not manipulate the exceptions to the fixed term rule to obtain an early election if it wished to do so. Thus, the possibility of a double dissolution is to be preserved. Its retention negates the fixed term concept. A double dissolution would be able to be engineered by the majority party in the House of Representatives where the Senate was of a different political complexion. It could create a deadlock between the two Houses by promoting a Bill that it knew the Senate would be bound to reject. The Government could than move at once to an election, one that would breach not only the fixed term of the House of Representatives but also the fixed term of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        But even apart from this possibility, the provisions of the Bill requiring a formal vote of no confidence before the government can gain an immediate election offer no guarantee against an early election before the government's full term expires. It cannot be assumed that a government would not be prepared to bring about an early election by resort to this sort of mechanism. This is exactly what happened in West Germany in 1972. Under the West German Constitution the term of the lower House of Parliament is fixed, subject to an early dissolution if the Chancellor is unable to obtain a vote of confidence in his Government. The similarity of this concept and what is in this Bill will be apparent, the only difference being that while the West German Constitution employs the mechanism of a defeated vote of confidence to bring about an early election, the proposal now before us employs the mechanism of a vote of no confidence.

        Chancellor Brandt announced in June 1972 that he intended to hold a general election later that year-about 10 months before the end of the Parliament's fixed term. In September that year he initiated the process by moving a vote of confidence in his own Government-a vote which he was determined to lose. In his autobiography Willie Brandt: People and Politics; the Years 1960-1975 he described the process in the following terms:

        My request for a vote of confidence under Article 68 of the Basic Law was laid before the Bundestag on 20 September and rejected-according to plan-two days later. To make doubly sure, I and a number of my colleagues abstained. Before the vote, I declared that it should really be sought, not in parliament, but from the sovereign electors of the country. Those who had switched their allegiance were fulfilling a veto function. 'The electors can decide whether to confirm that veto or, in accordance with my expectations, set it aside'. The Federal President dissolved the Bundestag and set new elections for 19 November.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be clear from this account that any fixed term proposal that endeavours to accommodate the need for an occasional early dissolution involves a delusion. Under the present proposal it would be possible for a government, in appropriate circumstances, to engineer a no confidence resolution against itself as a technicality to bring about an early election in which it could go to the people as the government. It would also remain possible to engineer a double dissolution, of course, as I have already said.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a solution to the 1975 situation the Bill turns out to be a partisan one. It involves abolition of the Senate's power to block Supply. Of course, I am not sure whether, in the light of recent utterances by leaders of the Australian Labor Party, the Bill in fact represents their current policy, but I suppose we must take it as it has been introduced. However, let me assure the Parliament and the people of Australia that, in contrast to the vacillations of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats on this point, the Government's policy on these matters is based on consistent and enduring principles and not on political expediency. We are committed to the co-equal and co-ordinate status of the Senate. We do not shrink from accountability to the electorate whenever Westminster principles indicate there should be an early election. We have also already indicated a preparedness to consider improvements within that system, as , for example, under the Court proposal adopted at the Perth Constitutional Convention in 1978.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me recall to the Senate some features of that proposal. The Court proposal would preserve the power of the Senate to withhold Supply. The proposal improves the present method of resolving deadlocks over Supply in a number of significant ways. It would, as developed, prevent unconstitutional tacking of extraneous items to Supply measures. It would also remove a major source of disruption which would otherwise result from the exercise of the Senate's power to block Supply, by ensuring the availability of authority to expend public funds until elections are held for both Houses of Parliament and a new Parliament appropriates funds. It would effectively streamline the present procedure to dissolve both Houses of Parliament and ensure that both Houses faced the electors in the event of a Senate withholding Supply. It would eliminate the need for the Governor-General to intervene in any deadlock between the two Houses over Supply. It would do this by requiring and not merely enabling both Houses to be dissolved.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, other solutions may be possible and the Government has an open mind on the matter. Thus, if we are to talk of 'realistic solutions' obviously consideration has to be given to the possibility of extending the term of Parliament from three to four years; not as part of a fixed term project but as allowing the possibility of Parliament extending to four years as in New South Wales. Such a proposal merits consideration. It might well gain wide support. Let us bear in mind the vote of the people of New South Wales on that subject. If we were to join that concept of simultaneous elections, as indeed is proposed in Senator Evans's Bill, with senators' terms consisting of two House of Representatives terms, we might have the basis for a realistic solution. Although the simultaneous elections proposal in 1977 failed to attract support from a majority of States it was endorsed by over 62 per cent of the popular vote at that referendum. Such a solution would, I believe, preserve the co- ordinate and co-equal status of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us bear in mind that a poll taken as late as December 1981 indicated that about 51 per cent of Australians believed present Senate powers to be about right, 17 per cent believed they were not great enough and only 16 per cent believed that they were too great. On the other hand, the Senate knows that in exercising its powers at least half of the Senate would have to face the electorate. Under the Court proposal, of course, the whole of the Senate would have to face the electorate. I realise that some senators do not support the simultaneous elections proposal. However, it may be the only acceptable way of accommodating the four-year term proposal to our bicameral system. It would offer significant advantages in its own right. As well as reducing the number of elections it would, by ensuring that the peoples' will is reflected simultaneously in both Houses, provide a more satisfactory electoral basis on which the government of the day could proceed. However, the Government will not support a proposal to strip the Senate of its powers and to prevent governments from accounting to, or appealing to, the electorate. For all these reasons, it will not support the Bill.

         —It is with some degree of disappointment that I follow the response of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the proposal before this chamber and, indeed, before the Parliament. It is surprising, surely , that the Attorney could find nothing good in the proposal. He characterised it as being a proposal of mere expediency. It is true that it is expedient that we, as a Senate, as a Parliament, deal with the unresolved dilemma left to us by the framers of the Constitution who created a political structure where the Executive is simultaneously responsible to two chambers, each of which can be constituted by different groups and alliances so that quite different political movements may have a majority in each of the chambers. It is expedient that we deal with that matter. But that is not to say that it cannot be dealt with in a principled way. I believe that the proposal put forward by Senator Evans can be called, if one likes, a principled expedient. It seems that there ought to be common ground between us that the traumatic events of 1975 ought not occur again . As the Canberra Times of 11 November 1981 stated:

        That point needs to be kept in mind as we seek a spirit which would govern this sort of discussion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The nature of the proposal is well known and fairly easily summarised, at least as to the core of it. It is that there should be fixed parliamentary terms with elections for both the House or Representatives and the Senate to be held every third Saturday of every third November. This would give a government security of tenure, generally speaking, against a hostile Senate. At the same time as a trade-off, the Government would lose its present prerogative of calling an early election to suit its political advantage. There are two necessary exceptions to this rule. One allows for an election if a government is defeated in the House of Representatives on a formal vote of no confidence and if no alternative Ministry emerges within seven days. The other provides for a double dissolution at the Government's discretion to break a sustained deadlock between the Houses on a series of legislative measures other than those money Bills critical to a government's continuing capacity to govern.

        I believe that the core of the proposal for a fixed term parliament is based, in the widespread community sense, on the fact that Australians are subjected to too many elections or, at least, to too many unpredictable elections which are called so often to secure some transient political advantage or to secure, on the basis of some temporary political support, yet another term in office. On 11 November last year, again concerning the constancy of elections to which the Australian people are subjected, the editor of the Australian Financial Review stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is all very well to say that ''the people should decide,'' but the people sometimes get very tired of having to go through tedious election campaigns which are out of context and aimed primarily at solving problems which their elected repesentatives are unable to solve for themselves.

        I believe that if the people become confused, bewildered and then apathetic about the manipulation of the political process, the dangers foreseen by the editorial writer of the Australian of 13 November 1981 will come to pass. The editorial writer stated:

       </para>

        There can be no doubt that Australia is governed less well than it would be were it the case that we had a more stable, assured term of office guaranteed to the government of the day, whatever its political complex. Let us not forget that the Australian national Government is based on compulsory universal franchise. To my mind, that invests it with a true democratic authority which is lacking even in some comparable Western democracies, like the United States, which do have a fixed term but which do not have compulsory franchise. In fact, President Reagan is in office with a mere 26 per cent of the vote-51 per cent of some 51 per cent of people who decided to vote. But the Australian Government is invested invariably with a much more solid vote of those entitled to vote in a federal election. It is invested with a true democratic authority. In my view it ought to be allowed to run, indeed it ought to be required to run, its full term . This would give a stability within which brave decision-making could be undertaken by a government without the constant apprehension that it would be politically unfortunate for it to undertake a particular course of action, say, after the mid-term point has been reached in its, at the moment, unfixed term of office. The Australian Financial Review, not the most radical journal in Australia, on 11 November 1981 stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The point is the effectiveness and consistency of the constitutional framework which now supports the right of an elected government to conduct its business.

        If Australian parliamentary terms ran for five years as those in the United Kingdom do, there might well be the strong arguments for having a Senate capable of exercising restraint on the Government of the day.

        That is said with due deference to the Australian Democrats. That is what the editorial writer said. Those words would never fall from my lips voluntarily. The fact is that we are not arguing for a four-year term; we are arguing for a fixed three-year term. That in itself brings certain restraints and limitations to bear on what a government will attempt to do during that term.

         —Learn nothing and remember nothing; that is correct. I believe in this Bill, with the amendments foreshadowed by Senator Evans last Thursday night , there is a foundation for constitutional reform which is based in the common sense of the people who do not want to be subjected to the uncertainty of elections called at the whim of a Prime Minister and, indeed, on the common experience of government in its need for a stability within which to pursue the policies for which it has a mandate. Therefore, I believe that the proposal from this side of the chamber is an altogether more comprehensive basis and gives us a more comprehensive context within which to seek a meeting between the major parties before going to the people with a referendum proposal. A bipartisan attitude would be essential to any referendum success. This is reflected in the Age of 11 November. This is my last quotation from the editorial response to the proposal as first put forward late last year. It states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This is a genuine, realistic attempt to resolve irreconcilable and troublesome concepts embedded in the Constitution, and it deserves consideration on its merits beyond immediate partisan and parochial interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that this chamber can give the proposal that sort of consideration. The Labor Party has sought to go beyond its initial vigorous response to the events of 1975. Honourable senators will recall that at that time our response was to say that the Senate should lose all power to reject or block money Bills of whatever description. The sole beneficiary of that sort of constitutional reform could only be the government of the day. The Bill also supersedes Sir Charles Court's proposal, which found some acceptance by a bare majority of the Constitutional Convention in Perth, that an automatic double dissolution should follow the failure to pass the Appropriation Bills. The sole beneficiary of that proposal would be the Senate and, to an extent also, the office of Governor- General in that it would have removed from it its present discretionary powers. We say that some solution is needed to the problems of the 1975 money Bills, to speak of them generally, and that our latest proposal-the proposal put to the chamber for consideration-would benefit the Government to the extent that we now say that a hostile Senate could not block those measures necessary to secure a government's capacity to govern, whether that be on the revenue raising or appropriating side.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bills circulated in November spoke of the Senate's concurrence not being required for the passage of any taxation or appropriation measure. I want it clearly noted that, after consultation on this side of the chamber, there has been a move to the position where we now propose that the Senate ought not to block those measures which are necessary to secure a government's capacity to govern. We refer there to both revenue raising and appropriation measures. That is obviously a much narrower category of money Bills than was formerly spoken of . It ought not to be forgotten that even with this proposal it is not said that the Senate should never see such Bills or consider such Bills. The concurrence of the Senate will always be sought in the months or 30 days that are allowed for. Full deliberation and debate would occur on those crucial, critical money Bills and, no doubt, requests during that time could be transmitted to the House of Representatives for its consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are the parameters and the extent of the role which the proposal allows the Senate in relation to these crucial money Bills. This particular distinction has arisen, I take it, out of our experience in this chamber in very recent times. It is said that a distinction can be drawn between, on the one hand, revenue raising measures or Bills earmarking moneys or revenue for government programs or administration generally which are essential to the survival of the Government or its capacity to govern and, on the other hand, those Bills which are arguably not so radically essential to the continuance of government but which, however, might impair particular programs, whatever their impact on general government revenues. One has in mind the Medibank levy rejected by the Opposition in this chamber during the Labor Government's time or the sales tax levy on certain items rejected by the Opposition in this chamber in recent weeks .
       </para>
       <para>
        I have claimed that there is such a distinction, that arguably this distinction can be drawn. I confess to some discomforture with the distinction. Whilst it is clear at the extremes where certain money Bills might lie-for example, there is a clear difference between the Supply Bills and a Bill appropriating several hundred thousand dollars for an agricultural research fund-it would be a brave person who could argue with absolute certainty about all the types of measures of a money character which might come into this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact that a government might not crumble in a fiscal sense on the rejection of the Medibank levy proposal or the sales tax on the essentials of life proposal is in itself no real indication of either the centrality of the measure to its electorally mandated program, as in the case of the Medibank levy, or the centrality betokened by the sales tax measures that we rejected. That measure really did betoken a fundamental shift of government revenue raising policy of profound significance. The fact is that governments prefer to govern and they will find other ways of funding a program or raising revenue if it is at all possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe the Committee stage will give us sufficient opportunity to seek wording which could embody the distinction. That is the role of this chamber at the Committee stage. The point I am trying to make is that this particular refinement, this difficult distinction that we are trying to draw is, in fact, a demonstration of the willingness of honourable senators on this side of the chamber to go beyond the proposal of last November. I believe that we have thereby signalled that we are prepared to move very significantly to accommodate to the greatest extent possible, consistent with our principles, those who objected to the proposal last November that the Senate should lose power over all money Bills of whatever description.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will return to the fixed term concept. As I said, the government of the day would be disadvantaged by such a proposal to the extent that it could not go to the people part way through its term hoping to avoid certain defeat at the end of the term. To put it more positively, as Senator Lewis and Senator Durack have tried to do, the government may seek a mandate on a crucial matter which, although not the substance of legislation rejected by the Senate, it needs to address but would prefer to do so with full expressed community support. That sort of power of the Government is hereby lost should this proposal be commended by the people. Of course-I cannot emphasise this too much-the Senate is still well able under our proposal to reject or to fail to pass legislative measures which a government might well regard as critical to its program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate still retains a tremendous range of law-making power under this proposal. As I said, measures which are quite critical to a government's mandated program could well be rejected by the Senate under this proposal. One has in mind such matters as legislation in the field of industrial relations or the national government's role in off-shore areas beyond the low water mark. If the frustration of a program of the government was intense enough, radically impairing the governing of the country according to the Executive's wishes, then a double dissolution could be called by the Government to resolve the deadlock which the Senate had created by the excise of its co-equal legislative powers. It is wrong to suggest that this proposal strips away the deliberative legislative law-making functions of this chamber. It does so in relation to a special category of money Bills-those which are crucial to a government's capacity to govern, whether concerning revenue raising or the earmarking of moneys for expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this proposal there is no question of the Senate losing its general law- making power. If the Government's policy is frustrated intensely enough or radically enough or over a wide range of measures then indeed it could call for a double dissolution to resolve the deadlock under the proposal now before the chamber. That was foreshadowed last Thursday night by my colleague, Senator Evans, as shadow Attorney-General. In the Bill circulated last November such a deadlock might have been resolved in one of two ways, either by double dissolution or by a joint sitting of the Parliament. That joint sitting would have had certain safeguards built into it so that not only would an absolute majority of the total number of the members of the two Houses be required to determine a question but also, in the case of each of at least one-half of the States, the proposal would need to be affirmed by at least one-half of the total number of the members of the two Houses chosen in or for the State.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was a rather difficult clause to draft but it was meant to embody some of the Federal characteristics which are lost when the bicameral legislature resolves into one chamber as it would at a joint sitting. Naturally, that clause was put in to try to allay the fears of those who would see in the joint sitting proposal too automatic a carrying into effect of the House of Representatives' will in regard to a particular legislative measure. On reflection it has been decided to abandon that clause and this proposal so that the only way of resolving a deadlock between two chambers is go to the people in a double dissolution. In that respect, as I said, we have abandoned a proposal which had merit and which in fact was endorsed and put forward by the 1959 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. In our desire to see a proposal come to this chamber which could command as wide a degree of support as possible we have said the only way to resolve the deadlock should be by double dissolution and fresh elections for both chambers. Further, whereas in the original proposal in November it was the case that following a double dissolution called by a government-its program being imperilled by the Senate-the new Parliament constituted after the election would commence a new fixed term, we say now that the new Parliament should merely see out the remainder of the fixed term during the course of which the double dissolution has been called.

        Of course, the proposal now means that if a double dissolution is called 18 months into a fixed term the new House of Representatives will see out only the remaining 18 months. Once again, this is a most important concession. It is a concession to those who argued, I think with a degree of justice, that the original proposal was overly advantageous, and therefore tempting, to a government which might contrive a double dissolution two years into its fixed term knowing that the final year of its fixed term might be extremely difficult- for example, in controlling the economy. I instance a foreshadowed decline in international trade. It would be very advantageous and tempting under the original proposal for a government to create a double dissolution in order to get a new three-year fixed term. Our amended proposal does away with that possibility.

       <para>
        It is interesting to note that in the Attorney's recalling of an incident in the West German political system he failed to say whether Willy Brandt thereby obtained a completely fresh fixed term or merely saw out the original fixed term . If it was the former, then indeed in our proposal before the chamber tonight we have met that objection.

        In three crucial respects, since the Bill was circulated last November, the Labor Party has sought to create a situation in which this chamber can endorse a Bill for a referendum to go to the people. I think this needs to be emphasised. We are not here making law. We are not here involved ourselves in changing the Constitution. We are trying to settle on a scheme which, by enhancing our democratic processes, can be commended to the people by all major political groupings. But ultimately we are putting to the people a proposal. Therefore, I think it is right that we should not be too wedded to our partisan political views. We need to create a situation in which the people can be presented with a proposal which has a reasonable chance of passage.

        As I said, I was extremely disappointed by the Attorney-General's response in that he found nothing good whatsoever in the Bill. It has five or six major elements, as Senator Lewis, who has now entered the chamber, pointed out in his speech last Thursday night. Some of them have more attraction than others. I will mention two which I found most attractive. The first is-the core of the matter as I see it-that the government of the day, if the proposal is carried, should be that group of Australians who enjoy the confidence of a majority of the House of Representatives. The Government should be destroyed only by losing that confidence or should be tested in the electorate only by the deliberate will of the House of Representatives in seeking to resolve a deadlock with the Senate. I find that proposal extremely appealing. The Bill expressly articulates what used to be a convention before 1975 and relieves the Governor-General of his decision-making role which he assumed in 1975 and which even the most reactionary members of our community now agree he should not be called upon to exercise. They do so because they feel that there is a risk of the Governor- General's so impairing the reputation of the office that it would be quite definitely imperilled. There is no doubt that any repetition of the event of 1975 and the Governor-General's involvement in it would lead to such a political upheaval that the office would not survive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important for many reasons that the office of the Governor- General does survive. There are those within the community who see the office of Governor-General as providing a valued link with the Crown and all the traditions which came to this country as a result of the rule of law and democratic procedures derived from the British Isles. I do not share that view. As the Senate would know, I believe that we should cut the nexus between Australia and the Crown. Nevertheless I believe the Governor-General has an important role in an Australian republic. I can see a transition to a republic where the Governor-General no longer has a constitutional role as representing the Crown, but, in fact, fulfils all the functions presently vested in him as the symbolic and, indeed, useful apex of our system of Government. However the Governor-General must exercise no discretion which would enable him to do as the then Governor-General did in 1975, that is select the Leader of the Opposition as the Prime Minister of the day. The House of Representatives must be, as this Bill proposes, the body properly constituted to create the Government of the day . the Prime Minister should be the person who commands its confidence and should resign if that confidence is lost, but only in that situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further aspect of the Bill which commends itself to me is the concurrence of the terms of House of Represenatives members with those of senators, senators holding office for two House of Representatives terms. At the moment there is an absolutely absurd and undemocratic situation prevailing. I was elected in late 1977 and Senator Chipp was elected in late 1980. Although we were elected in those years we in fact did not take our places in the chamber until the July following, some seven or eight months after our election. Those honourable senators who either did not contest the election because they were retiring from the Senate or who were voted out by the people were still in this chamber for those eight months engaging in the deliberate law-making process of this nation while we who had been elected were out in the wilderness. Concurrence of terms is a most important advance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I gave an undertaking to the Whip that I would speak only for 30 minutes. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I reiterate that we are not changing the Constitution; we are concerned to devise a proposal which will allow the Australian people to make their choice as to a change in the Constitution. It is a conservative electorate; it is a very peculiarly constructed electorate for the purpose of constitutional change. I believe that this proposal has enough merit in it to receive a second reading from this chamber. At the Committee stage we can refine it as may be necessary so that ultimately a proposal to overcome the traumatic events of 1975 can go to the people.

         —by leave-Once again I rise to refer to Notice of Motion No. 1 which formally stands in my name. It may no longer be standing in my name. Earlier today I indicated that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances had sought certain undertakings from the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) in relation to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Regulations. At that time Senator Button, Leader of the Opposition, asked me to make available to all honourable senators my letter on behalf of the Committee to the Attorney-General and the response of the Attorney-General. I indicated that I would make those letters available. At the time I was confronted with the problem of Standing Order 308 about making available to my colleagues material which was before the Committee. However, the Committee met at 6 o'clock this evening and resolved that these two documents be made available. Accordingly I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard my letter of 18 March 1982 as Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to the Attorney-General and the Attorney-General's reply to me dated 23 March 1982.

If you are unable to provide such an undertaking, the Committee will proceed with its notice of disallowance of the Regulations on Tuesday next.

In my letter of 11 March 1982 I had informed you of the policy decision reached by the Government, that amendments should be introduced to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill now before the Parliament to make specific provision for giving, on request, information regarding decisions to promote or transfer individual officers to persons affected by those decisions, with a consequential amendment to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to be introduced at the same time.

        I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Perhaps I should make it clear that I am not speaking on behalf of the Committee because, as Senator Lewis indicated, the Committee decided not to proceed with the disallowance motion. I do not want to go too deeply into the whole contents of this matter. However, it really started in about 1979 when the Government indicated that it was proposing to introduce streamlining procedures relating to promotions and appeals in the Public Service. A lot of events have happened since then in related fields, such as the Ellicott judgment in the Finch case. These regulations were introduced on 27 September 1981. The notice of intention to disallow was given by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee Chairman on 24 November 1981. On 11 March-that is only within the last fortnight-the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) replied to the Committee. The matter relates to the giving of reasons in connection with Public Service promotions and promotion appeals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem is that the regulations take away rights of individuals. They were initially taken away for 12 months by an Act of this Parliament, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The regulations introduced last year sought to extend that removal of rights for a further 12 months. The extension brings about an undue restriction on people for yet another 12 months. It may be argued that there are only six months of that period left in which to proceed. On 29 October last year the Government introduced the Public Service Act Amendment Bill into the House of Representatives. It has sat somewhere near the bottom of the Notice Paper since then. Of course, one of the problems with this whole matter is timing. This is the fifteenth sitting day, the last possible day for this matter to be dealt with. It was today that the Government agreed to the Committee's proposal that it would advance the consideration of the Public Service Amendment Bill in the House of Representatives. I disagreed with that decision of the Committee to accept that arrangement as a reason for not proceeding with the disallowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem is that this whole matter of promising to bring on the Bill does not remove or minimise the present problem of a lack of rights to reasons. It has to be said that the Government will not necessarily propose amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act which are acceptable to all concerned, whether it be the intent of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in attempting to co-operate with the Government, or the Public Service unions involved, or anybody else for that matter. It has been going on for some years now. I think we should indicate to the Government that it is time that the Government and the Public Service Board provided the framework for the giving of reasons. I believe that that is sufficient argument to support the proposition that the regulations be disallowed.

         —The Government opposes the motion for disallowance of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Regulations. I am pleased that the correspondence that I have had with the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has been tabled. I hope that honourable senators will have the opportunity of reading that correspondence before they vote on this motion. By and large, public servants, along with the rest of the community, have not had the right at any stage to receive reasons for administrative decisions. There may be some situations where a right was created. Under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act there is a right of appeal to obtain a reason for a decision by the Tribunal . Until the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act was proclaimed on 1 October 1980 there was no general right for anybody, including public servants, to obtain reasons for promotion and transfer decisions. Of course, when the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act was proclaimed this was one of the great advances in the civil rights of Australians. However, that Act provided for an exemption for 12 months for decisions relating to promotions and transfers of public servants. That exemption was recommended by the Administrative Review Council to enable the Public Service Board to get its procedures into shape to cope with the need to give reasons.

        The Public Service Board has been concerned with this and many other problems, particularly the implementation of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, chaired by Dr Coombs. Unfortunately it was not in a position to put before the Parliament a major Bill concerning not only this question but also many other major questions affecting the Public Service within the time frame allowed by the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The period of grace of 12 months which was provided in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act expired on 30 September last year before the legislation that the Public Service Board and the Government, on its recommendation, proposed to put before the Parliament was in place. That is a matter of regret and--

         —Not only staff shortages but also a lot of other major issues were involved in it. All that I can do is express regret. But that is the situation. The new code relating to public servants which dealt with many problems, in particular the problem we have before us tonight, was not available on that date. Accordingly, the Government decided that it would take advantage of an opportunity to promulgate regulations which would extend for one further year the exemption of the Public Service Board from providing reasons in these cases, to enable this legislation to be brought before the Parliament and for the whole question to be determined by the Parliament. Senator Coates said that somehow or other these regulations are taking away rights that people have. That is not the fact. Public servants do not have and never have had the right to obtain reasons for decisions relating to promotion or transfer. The Government and the Public Service Board recognises-I think it is widely accepted-that these people ought to have some rights in this regard. The major part of the Public Service Amendment Bill has already been introduced but correspondence which has been tabled indicates that the Government has drafted and is about to introduce amendments to that legislation which will provide a method of giving to an unsuccessful applicant reasons why he was not successful in his promotion appeal .
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The difficulty that we face with the blanket application of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is that, in giving reasons in a very broad sense under that Act why a particular applicant did not succeed, one would have to provide all sorts of information about all the other unsuccessful applicants. Questions of confidentiality are very deeply involved. I have no reason to believe that the proposed statement of reasons which will be provided for in this legislation to be proposed to the Parliament will not be satisfactory as far as this aspect of it is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        In anticipation of a full debate on this subject in this Parliament over forthcoming weeks the Government is concerned that the whole question of giving reasons should be immediately thrown completely into the melting pot by vote of the Senate tonight. If this motion succeeds-perhaps in many respects this is because procedures are not available and have not been developed-the full effect of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act will come into force tomorrow. But those provisions will be in force only until the Parliament determines in the next few weeks the nature of the reasons to be given to public servants in respect of promotion and transfer decisions. I find it very difficult to understand the purpose of the Senate disallowing these regulations tonight. They really only preserve the status quo until the Parliament deals with this matter. I might say, in addition to what I said in the letter-perhaps this should have been included in it-that the Bill will have provisions for the new procedures to be brought into effect as soon as possible after assent is given to that legislation. It will not be a matter of waiting until 30 September this year before the provision takes effect. It can take effect virtually as soon as assent to the Bill has been given.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of passing this disallowance motion tonight will be simply to bring in some quite new form of reasons which no one has ever had before, which are not really applicable to the Public Service and which will be effective only until the Parliament, in the forthcoming weeks, determines its attitude on this measure. The Parliament will not necessarily accept the proposals contained in the Bill, but it will have the fullest opportunity to determine what it believes should be the right procedures. All I am saying is that I hope the Senate will not take action tonight which will anticipate in many ways the decisions of this Parliament and which at best will have the effect only of implementing a system which may well be changed by this Parliament in the course of the next few weeks . I want to stress again that there is no question that these regulations, which the motion seeks to disallow, are in fact removing any rights that public servants now have. They have never had those rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be a matter of regret that they have never had them. I could not agree more; I have been a great proponent of the reasons for decision principle and I thoroughly support the notion that there should be reasons available. It is a question only in regard to promotions and transfer decisions as to what is the appropriate form of those reasons. As I said, that is the matter which will be dealt with in the legislation which Parliament will have the fullest opportunity of debating and determining in the remaining weeks of the current session.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope the Senate will not support this motion to disallow which seems to have been moved by some misapprehension as to the actual state of the law at the moment. This is ahead of and in anticipation of the major consideration of this whole matter which will be before the Senate in the next few weeks. As I said, whatever decision the Parliament comes to on this measure will be given immediate effect by the terms of the Bill and by the undertaking which I am giving to the Parliament on behalf of the Government.

He said that the Senate should maintain the status quo created by the present regulation as though that were desired. But the fact is that the status quo desired by this Parliament, when it passed section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, was that a person aggrieved by a decision ought to be able to obtain the reasons for that decision. That is the right which this Parliament-the House of Representatives and the Senate-agreed ought to be conferred on or ought to inhere in a person aggrieved by a decision, including a decision as to promotion or transfer within the Public Service. In fact this Parliament decided that that right ought to exist, or it decided, if one likes, to recognise that right within a public servant aggrieved by a decision.

        The regulation therefore alters the status quo-the prevailing situation-desired by the elected representatives of the people. The Executive decided that that situation should not prevail initially for a period of 12 months. When this initial 12-month period was decided upon as a breather in order to get procedures streamlined and in accordance with the general desire that reasons be provided, the unions agreed. The Administrative and Clerical Officers Association agreed that that ought to be the case. The unions in this respect are, of course, entirely reasonable. It would have been unreasonable of them to expect that these procedures could suddenly be brought into operation overnight. But now the Executive is saying to this Parliament: 'We want to frustrate the will of the Parliament as expressed in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act for yet another 12 months.'

         —That is how I read it and that is what I believe is occurring. This time it has been done without any consultation with the unions. This further extension of 12 months was announced to the unions at the very same time as the heads of department were informed by the Public Service Board that this was the case. The Public Service Board-the Government, if one likes-has become undone by its own failure to move expeditiously in a manner in which it knew it had to move because it knew as well as anyone that the Senate would be engaged in the sort of discussion in which it is engaged tonight. For the Senate to disallow this regulation would be indeed to allow the right to operate which this Parliament desired should operate. It might do so only for a period of weeks. It might be that when the Parliament is presented with the Public Service Act amendments we will find that the procedures set down with the various methods of giving reasons and so on are adequate. It may be that we do not find them adequate and that amendments are proposed in this chamber on representation by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACOA or indeed out of our own good sense, in which case the matter might not be resolved until the Budget session. There is certainly no guarantee that the amendment to the Public Service Act will be passed during the autumn session which, as we know, will be truncated and could well be over, as far as this chamber is concerned, by 6 May.

        What we on this side of the chamber are saying-I believe that the sentiment is shared by others on this side of the chamber outside the Australian Labor Party- is that in the interim before the Parliament comes to a decision in relation to the amendment to the Public Service Act that has been foreshadowed the rights which this Parliament has desired should be exercised by public servants, as by all others aggrieved by these sorts of decisions, ought to be exercised. It is my understanding in any case that the various promotion appeal tribunals are geared up to institute a system of giving reasons. I do not believe that any great hardship would be caused to the Public Service in requiring that those reasons be given as from tomorrow. That was the desire of this Parliament. It was agreed that the right ought to be suspended, as it were, for some 12 months. There is now an attempt by the Executive to extend it, without consultation with the unions concerned. I believe that the Parliament should say that the Public Service Board has had time enough.

         —I was not at the meeting this evening because of other engagements, as the honourable senator knows, but I certainly would have supported the view which apparently the majority of the Committee then expressed . It seems to me that a good reason has to be found why the Senate should on the motion of a member of the Committee, take a different course, disallow the regulations and create rights which may exist for a few weeks or months before the Parliament has the opportunity of determining, by decisions it makes on the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill, what shall be the rights of public servants in this regard. I believe it should not alter rights in this way. As honourable senators know, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee requested advice from the Government on when the Bill would be dealt with. The Bill was introduced to give the opportunity to the public to look at it and express its views late last year. I was very strongly of the view that should be done. I have not heard any comments to indicate any logical views on the Bill. I hope that there will be.

         —The general public will also want to see the Attorney's amendments, make up its mind about them and make further representations.

       <para>
        In respect of the latter Bill-that is, the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill- the ACTU asked the Public Service Board and the Government in October to set aside certain parts of the Bill for further consultation through joint council. It is my understanding that that request of the ACTU has not been acceded to by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, the whole Bill has been before the public since November. We have been awaiting, as members of parliament, the views of the Public Service unions and the public. I would be very interested to know the views of public servants in regard to the rights that ought to be enjoyed by them in promotions and appeals. It is not just a matter of what the Government might discuss with the joint councils; the public and other members of parliament ought to know the views of public servants on this matter. A delay has occurred over the last few months so that the public can have the opportunity of coming forward with those ideas. Now that the question of disallowance is to be considered the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has given notice that it will hold its position because there is a certain connection between the regulations and the proposed Bill. We have had an undertaking from the Attorney in his letter of 23 March 1982. Although the letter has been tabled I think it is important that I should read a paragraph. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am now writing to assure you that it is the intention of the Government to bring forward these amendments to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill, including the proposed amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, to be moved in the House of Representatives and to seek to have the Bill taken through all stages in the House of Representatives and brought forward for debate in the Senate during the present period of Sittings, and that the Government will use its best endeavours to give effect to this intention.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a very clear and desirable undertaking. It is important that the decision should be not made upon the termination of a regulation to create rights which, as the Attorney has said, did not exist in the past and which may last for a period of only a few months. The decision should be made following debate in this chamber and in the House of Representatives on the amending Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have certain reservations about the terms of the original Bill relating to this subject. It deals with a number of other matters as well which I make no comment upon. I probably diverge somewhat from the Attorney's view but Mr Justice Ellicott found in the Goldstein case that public servants have, on appeals and promotions, rights of natural justice and rights to hear the other side and to know the case against them, and my understanding is that the Bill is designed to change the results of that judgment. In other words, it will take away some of the rights of public servants at common law. That proposal must be scrutinised very carefully by the Parliament before it happens. I can well see that where many people are seeking promotion there are practical difficulties in regard to making available details of everyone else's qualifications and applications. A question of privacy may be concerned but it is important that people have a right to know the cases they have to answer and to know the types of qualifications held by those who are competing for the same jobs so that they can put their cases properly. There are rights which must be carefully scrutinised when this Bill comes before this chamber for consideration. But we should not determine tonight to disallow a regulation which extends the period of 12 months in the original Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tate said that it was intended by the Parliament that the period should be only 12 months and then the rights should proceed. I think we would all regret that the change in the law was not dealt with within that 12 months period and that, for whatever reason, the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill was not dealt with in that time. But it was not. To suggest that the Parliament consciously formed a conclusion that it would want an extension of only 12 months and would not want any further extension is quite unjustifiable. In view of the importance of the Bill it would be ridiculous, I suggest, for this chamber to disallow a regulation, create some rights which would give people an impression that that would be the permanent situation and then perhaps take those rights away in three or four months or change them in some way.

There is nothing extraordinary about that and that was the intention of the Parliament when it passed the Act. We may not have desired that but it was the major will of the Parliament in passing the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The Government has exercised that power with a further extension of 12 months. I suggest that it would be highly desirable if the regulation could stand and that it would be irresponsible to disallow it at this stage. It would also run in the face of undertakings which the Regulations and Ordinance Committee has obtained in good faith from the Government with regard to this Bill. I urge those honourable senators who are not on the cross benches to consider the matter carefully and not vote for disallowance of this regulation.

         —The item before the Senate tonight is Statutory Rule No. 274 of 1981 in which the Government seeks to extend the period of exclusion of promotion appeals matters from reference to the administrative appeals judicial review process for a further 12 months, as I understand it, from September 1982. This seems to indicate that there is still some time in which progress may be made in relation to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill which has already been the subject of debate tonight. As we see it, the legislation that comes before this chamber from the Government presumably is under Government control. The Government, in terms of its time and that of its departments, can bring forward that legislation when it is prepared. I believe that the Senate must address itself to the issues that are before it. The issue before it at present is the disallowance of Statutory Rule No. 274 of 1981.

        I believe that surely is a matter which arises under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. It should, therefore, be dealt with as a matter distinct from the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill when it comes forward. Certainly those pieces of legislation deal with similiar matters, but it does not seem to be appropriate to seek a trade-off between them in terms of whether this statutory rule ought to continue for another 12 months. The onus for the argument for the addition of 12 months must surely lie with the Government. The Parliament allowed a 12-month period. The Government is now seeking an additional 12-month period. The Parliament presumably, if it had sufficient reasons before it, would agree to that. I do not think those reasons have yet been presented.

        The discussions in relation to the Public Service Acts do not seem to me to bear terribly strongly upon the matter at all. I presume that as the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill-unlike Senator Missen I have had a great deal of correspondence with relevant organisations already in relation to this Bill- comes closer to debate in this chamber there will be a lot more correspondence and concern within the community on a range of matters in that Bill.

         —Senator Lewis was complaining that he did not get some a little while ago. Perhaps I could send him some as well. The Public Service Acts Amendment Bill will, I am quite sure, raise many interesting problems. I hope that it will be the basis of considerable debate in this House. This Parliament has a unique responsibility in terms of the Public Service. Surely it must not be under any pressure to move through these Public Service Acts because of the problems in relation to appeals. It would seem to us, therefore, that it would be advisable to allow the disallowance to take place, to allow that right to public servants under the Administrative Appeals (Judicial Review) Act. I accept the point of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that this would mean, indeed, giving public servants a right which they did not have before but it is a right which I believe this Parliament and, indeed, the community in general believe should be there from all judicial acts of government. We are not doing anything terribly radical by extending that right to the Public Service. I believe that when we get around-I say that correctly-to discussing the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill, indeed, there are many other matters which are just about to come into the Parliament which do not seem to have arrived here yet, this Parliament will make up its mind in relation to that Bill. I do not think that matter ought to be brought in when discussing this case. We have to address ourselves to this matter. In this matter it seems relatively clear that the Act ought to extend to the Public Service. Therefore, the Australian Democrats will be voting for disallowance.

         —I think Senator Tate clarified the situation for the Senate. The Administrative Appeals (Judicial Review) Act was passed by the Senate and by the House of Representatives. There was an Executive decision to put into place statutory rules which provided exemptions to provisions of the Administrative Appeals (Judicial Review) Act. It was not the decision of the Senate; the decision was taken by the Executive Government after discussions, of course, with relevant organisations so as to allow time for the Public Service Board and others to get their act together. A further decision has been taken by the Executive Government to put in place a statutory rule which would extend that exemption to 31 August of this year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We in the Senate are being asked to countenance what I believe we should not be asked to countenance; that is, the failure of the relevant authorities to act in accordance with the provisions of the legislation that was passed by the Parliament. It is all very well for the Executive Government-that is its job-to suggest subordinate legislation which would give time, for example, for an organisation under its purview to develop administrative machinery which would be required to ensure the proper operation of legislation. That is fair enough. To suggest that that legislation ought to be extended for another 12 months and to suggest that we in the Senate ought to cop that is not a proper suggestion. I do not blame the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) because it is not his department that is concerned in this case. I have some quarrel with him in respect of a piece of legislation from his Department that will be debated tomorrow. I will have enough arguments with the Attorney-General tomorrow about that piece of legislation relating to family law. However, I am not prepared as a member of this Parliament to allow a situation to continue whereby we give an extended period for a Public Service body, such as the Public Service Board, or other institutions, to develop their machinery which ought to have been developed well and truly before this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other aspect I am concerned about is that we have been told by the Attorney -General that of course there will be amendments to the Public Service Acts. Those amendments will bear upon this issue as to the provision of reasons in respect of motions, appeals, and so on. We have the Attorney's assurance that that will be expedited, so far as the Government is concerned, through the House of Representatives and through the Senate. On the other hand, we have heard Senator Missen indicate that, no matter what happens, this statutory rule will expire on 31 August 1982. That is true. If somehow or other the Senate could be assured that the amendments to the Public Service Acts would be dealt with in this session then that would be another question. I cannot see how the Minister can give that assurance because it is really not in his hands. It is in the hands of the Parliament once it hits the deck in the House of Representatives. Of course, it is in our hands when it is dealt with here. I make it perfectly clear that I for one will not be a party to any delay in the amendments to the Public Service Acts. If the Federal Secretary to the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association says that he wants a delay I do not think that is acceptable either. He ought to have his act together and so ought all of the other organisations. I will not be a party-I make that very clear now-to any delay in the passage of appropriate amendments to the Public Service Acts.

         —in reply-I want to answer a couple of points made by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and Senator Missen and to emphasise that the rights involved in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act have already been created. It was the intention of the Parliament that they come into effect about six months ago. The regulation to extend that period certainly was provided, but I would have thought that that was to cover a situation of a few weeks-perhaps an emergency situation-when the matter was in the last throes of being dealt with. Even though this extension has been by way of regulation, it has still had an effect for a further six months. It has not been just an emergency extension; it already has lasted six months. I think that is a very unfortunate part of this whole process and the procedure of this Parliament.

        Even though 15 sitting days can be allowed for notice to be given and then 15 sitting days for the matter to be dealt with, it has taken from September last year until now, the last possible date, for it to be dealt with. This has meant that there has been legislation by regulation for all that time. The Government has taken total advantage of those two lots of 15 sitting days. The time has been stretched to the absolute limit. The Government knew that this notice for disallowance had been given. Apparently it has had very little effect on the Government getting its act together and providing the proper legislation that is required. As I have said before, the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill is before the House of Representatives. To clarify the point that Senator Harradine was making, I inform the Senate that the relevant amendments that we are talking about are not contained in that Bill as it now stands. They are amendments which the Government has yet to introduce as amendments to that Bill. In fact, they have yet to be drafted. The instructions have only just gone to the--

         —As I understand it, only in recent days did the instructions go to the draftsmen as to how the amendments ought to be changed. I would suggest to Senator Harradine-I hope in a quite reasonable fashion-that once those amendments hit the deck he would want there to be at least some reasonable time for consultation with the relevant unions. This has not happened properly so far . The other point that needs to be made about the Administrative Decisions ( Judicial Review) Act amendments, which apparently are to be part of this package , is that the rights which those amendments will remove from the present Act may be totally unacceptable to the unions involved or to the Parliament in its decision making process or the public generally. It may be that the amendments are not judged to be able to work in a proper fashion. So despite the fact that we may be wanting to give a speedy passage to whatever amendments come through for the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill, there is at least a chance that they will not be passed even by September, at which time the regulations will expire anyway.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also make the point that it is improper to extend this suspension of rights by using regulations for such a long period-not just for a few days or weeks, but for a period which was set out to be 12 months. Even though extension was made by way of regulations and had the possibility of being disallowed by the Parliament, just by the mere effluxion of time it has been in effect for six months anyway. As Senator Missen said, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances proposed-or the majority of the Committee members proposed-its compromise with the Government in good faith. I do not believe that ought to take away the right to disallow these regulations. We ought to ensure that the rights which were intended to be given to members of the Public Service last year are provided. We ought to ensure that their rights are enhanced so that their apparent faith in the Government can be restored.

         —The Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Amendment Bill establishes procedures for the emergency rationing of electricity in the Australian Capital Territory. Limitations on power supplies have been an ongoing problem in south-eastern Australia in recent years, with the blackouts and restrictions in Victoria in 1979 and 1980 and, more recently, in New South Wales. Since New South Wales supplies 60 per cent of the electricity consumed in the Australian Capital Territory, the remaining 40 per cent coming from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, in the view of the Opposition it is quite sensible for the Government to introduce legislation of this type. The Opposition supports the Bill. After the Bill has been passed, as I expect it will be tonight, the Minister for the Capital Territory may issue guidelines which will become operative within five sitting days of the Parliament. Emergency regulations may be then issued at any time. They would become operative immediately but would be subject to the normal disallowance procedures within 15 sitting days.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Because of the five sitting days required between the issuing of the guidelines and the subsequent issuing of regulations, the legislation could not become effective until very close to the end of April. I presume that by that stage it will have become an Act. Since it was introduced into the House of Representatives on 10 March and there have been five sitting days since 10 March , I think the Government has been probably a little tardy in introducing the Bill into the Senate, given the very serious situation currently existing in and around Canberra. As Senator Jessop said this morning-I think I have his words down correctly-'saving electricity in the Australian Capital Territory could mean saving jobs in New South Wales'. It is probably a pity that this legislation was not introduced into the Senate last week so that it could have been operative by the end of this week. However, I do not want to be too critical on that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is without doubt great scope for conservation of and reductions in electricity usage in this city and, indeed, in Australia generally without, I might add, imposing significant hardships or even inconvenience on citizens. Australia's usage of electricity is profligate and has been profligate for many years-a profligate usage encouraged ironically to some extent by the very electricity authorities which are now unable to meet the demand which they themselves have helped to generate. I notice that there has been in Parliament House today-I presume this is not coincidental-some attempt to restrict electricity consumption. Many of the lights which are normally on in the corridors have been off. I applaud that move. I would also applaud more rational management of the air conditioning system in this building. In wintertime the normal temperature in this building seems to be too high and in summertime too low.

         —It might vary from one office to another but certainly in the part of the building where my office is that is the impression that I usually get. It certainly would not impose any great physical discomfort on any of us if the temperature were allowed to vary somewhat more than it does to be more attuned to the outside temperatures, with very great savings of current as a result. Of course, while the amount of electricity used in this building is insignificant compared with the total electricity consumption, it is symptomatic of the profligate usage of electricity to which we have become conditioned and which, with or without any problems regarding the supply of electricity in Victoria or New South Wales or anywhere else, could be modified with considerable social advantage. The attempts to economise on electricity usage in this building were not apparently applied last night by other Public Service buildings in Canberra, judging from the photograph on the front page of the Canberra Times this morning which showed many buildings-though I would not say all were public buildings, one was for certain a public building at Russell Hill -fully illuminated in the middle of the night. That is, of course, not uncommon as anyone who moves around Canberra at night will know. The Treasury building, for example, is normally lit as late as 2 a.m. and, for all I know, is lit right through until daylight. That is a matter which has been taken up in Estimates committee meetings in the past.

Perhaps, as Senator McIntosh implies, that is at the root of the previous reluctance to save electricity by switching off superfluous lighting.

        I want to say a couple of words on the details of the Bill. I understand that some concern has been expressed by residents of the Australian Capital Territory on civil liberties grounds. There appears to be a belief that premises may be subjected to arbitrary search by officials enforcing whatever regulations may be issued. It is explicitly provided in the Bill that a warrant must be issued before officials can search for that reason. It seems that that is adequately covered. The Government has also, in this Bill, taken the opportunity to make other amendments to the principal Act, one of which conforms with the policy adopted by the Government some years ago with respect to the declaration of pecuniary interests by members of statutory authorities of the Commonwealth. The Bill provides that members of authorities must declare their pecuniary interests and that where they have a conflict of interest they shall not take part in relevant deliberations of the authority. It provides for the sacking of members who do not abide by those rules. The Opposition supported the insertion of similar rules into other Acts governing statutory authorities. In this case we welcome it also. It is a pity, perhaps, that the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) declines to apply the same sort of pecuniary interest tests within his own Cabinet that the Government is applying to statutory authorities.

         —I want to refer the some aspects of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Amendment Bill 1982 which has been introduced to provide emergency provisions so that in the event of a threatened interruption to the power supply in the Capital Territory steps can be taken to ensure proper and the best usage of electricity. It provides for notice to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. It indicates that the Minister for the Capital Territory can gazette a period not to exceed 28 days. It further provides that in the event that the situation changes it can be revoked. I think it is regrettable that it is necessary. But I think what we have seen in the last couple of weeks indicates that this sort of legislation needs to be available in the Australian Capital Territory. Questions have been raised about the civil liberties aspect of the Bill. I agree also that there is provision for the granting of a warrant. I think there is adequate provision in that respect. Penalties are provided in the amount of $2,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a corporate body which may breach the regulations.

       <para>
        Since 1929 the Australian Capital Territory has purchased electricity from New South Wales both as electricity and in connection with power transmission. The price paid is fixed, I think, on an annual basis. There have been very few problems over the years. In 1975 there was some difficulty, but we have had to face difficulties since June 1981. I think the requests for cutbacks in the Australian Capital Territory, then and recently, have been quite successful. I believe that if there were to be problems this winter requests for cutbacks would be quite successful. But I think it is necessary, in view of the serious problems which have arisen, that this legislation should be available to see that electricity is best used. About 60 per cent of our power comes directly from New South Wales. The 40 per cent of electricity that comes from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority also, of course, comes to us through the New South Wales transmission system.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been suggestions that the Commonwealth should, in a sense, demand more of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. I wish briefly to refer to that aspect of the matter and to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949. I think it is worth referring to some aspects of it. The Bill, in the preamble says, amongst other things:
       </para>
       <para>
        AND WHEREAS it is desirable that provision should be made now to enable increased supplies of electricity to be immediately available in time of war:
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, we hope that that is not a matter to which we are referring. The next paragraph states:
       </para>
       <para>
        And whereas the consumption of electricity in the Australian Capital Territory and, in particular, at the Seat of Government within that Territory, is increasing and is likely to continue to increase:
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, it has. The population of Canberra is very much larger now than it could have been envisaged in 1949. Section 4 of the Act provides for an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Victoria. The agreement, which is a schedule to the Act, is a part of the Act. It has been approved and incorporated as part of the Act and sets out the actual arrangements which operate. Section 16 of the Act states:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) The functions of the Authority are-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) with the object of assisting to ensure that adequate supplies of electricity are available, in time of war as well as in time of peace, in the States of New South Wales and Victoria and in the Australian Capital Territory for purposes necessary or conducive to the defence of the Commonwealth and for other purposes of the Commonwealth, to provide hydro-electric works in the Snowy Mountains Area for the generation of electricity;
       </para>
       <para>
        The Schedule deals in some detail with the functioning and running of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Part V of Schedule 1, which relates to generation and supply of electricity, provides for the Commonwealth, during construction, to declare the amount of electricity it would want from each stage of development. It makes provision for the Commonwealth's reservation to be notified to the Authority. Subsequently it provides that the balance be divided two-thirds for the State of New South Wales and one-third for the State of Victoria. The Schedule very clearly indicates that if the Commonwealth wished to change the amount that it received, it would have to be agreed by Victoria and New South Wales. That is a problem that may take some time to solve. I think it is unlikely that either of the States concerned would want to interfere with the agreement as it stands. In addition, New South Wales has provided the balance of the electricity which the Australian Capital Territory has needed over the years . I think to talk about changing the Schedule to the Snowy Mountains Hydro- electric Power Act is, perhaps, embarking upon something which may not be in the best interests of anyone involved, particularly the Australian Capital Territory .
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said at the beginning of my speech, the transmission of electricity to the Australian Capital Territory comes entirely on power lines provided by New South Wales. In a sense, I suppose, one could say that they are leased. If the Commonwealth thought it could take more of the Snowy electricity and provide its own transmission lines, the cost would be a great deal more. It would be something that could not really be justified when the other facility is, in fact , available. Basically, what I am saying is that it is an economically sound system that has exhibited sensible planning and worked well. For that reason, I think that for the Australian Capital Territory, in a sense to change it unilaterally is something that could not be achieved and may, in fact, leave us particularly vulnerable. If there were industrial trouble in the Snowy Mountains area, the Australian Capital Territory could be very much at the mercy of New South Wales and left without power. If New South Wales cut off the transmission supplies we again would be extremely vulnerable. These are perhaps rather far- fetched propositions, but I think we need to look at the situation in totality.
       </para>
       <para>
        While there can be absolutely no doubt that it is most regrettable that the management of the New South Wales system has in recent times been such as to cause the situation which we have seen recently, it would not be prudent for us to embark on the course which some have proposed, namely, demanding that the Commonwealth insist upon a greater share of the hydro-electric power supply. In fact, that power supply boosts the peak needs in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and presumably Victoria. There is no reason for that situation to be changed as long as we can still get the power that we need. In the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory on Energy Use, Distribution and Conservation in the Australian Capital Territory some reference was made to the question of electric supply. Recommendation No. 4 stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommends that the ACTEA conduct a survey of the generating equipment within the ACT with a view to establishing whether or not there are adequate emergency facilities within the ACT.
       </para>
       <para>
        As yet the Government has not responded to this report. Events of the last couple of weeks indicate that a fairly early response to this report should be given. I urge that this recommendation be implemented so that we know what is available in the Australian Capital Territory and what emergency facilities we can look to in the event of there being a crisis. It comes into the category of at least trying to help ourselves to the greatest extent possible. I hope that the industrial troubles and other problems which are plaguing the New South Wales system will be overcome and that the management of the facilities will be such that these problems will not arise during this winter. I believe that Mr Wran has said that the crisis should last for not more than 12 months. In a climate such as Canberra has that could mean an extremely cold winter, especially for old people or people who are invalid and somewhat restricted to their homes. It may well be that we need the emergency provisions which are provided for in the Bill which we are discussing tonight. I certainly hope that it will not be necessary for them to be used. I commend to the Senate that the legislation be passed so that it can be available if necessary.

         —The Australian Democrats support the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Amendment Bill. I am very pleased that both speakers in the debate, one from the Labor Party and the other from the Liberal Party, have not debased the debate on this Bill in the Senate in the way in which it was debased in the House of Representatives. Both speakers dealt with the impact of the Bill, as I hope I will be able to do. A possible emergency will manifest itself on the Australian Capital Territory for the reasons which have been stated by the two honourable senators who have spoken in this debate so far. One hopes that the provisions of the Bill will not need to be implemented, but I support the necessity to introduce such legislation.

        I wish to bring a discordant note into the debate with regard to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) in particular but also with regard to the public servants of the Department of the Capital Territory and permanent heads of all or most of the departments situated in Canberra. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who represents in this chamber the Minister for the Capital Territory, when he replies to the second reading debate, to inform the Senate what instructions or requests, if any, emanating from the Department of the Capital Territory, have gone to other departments to enter into the spirit of conserving electricity in the Australian Capital Territory since it was diagnosed that there would be a shortage of electricity in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory would be expected to make a contribution to alleviating the problem.

       <para>
        I drove into Canberra last night from northern New South Wales and was shocked at what I would regard as nothing short of a scandal. The front page of the Canberra Times shows only a small part of what can only be regarded as evidence of mismanagement, a do-not-give-a-damn attitude and a scandal of gigantic proportions. Almost every light in every public and private building in Canberra was blazing at sunset last night. I ask the Minister: If the Minister for the Capital Territory can turn sprinklers on in a flash on protesters on the lawn of Parliament House, if he can threaten to put manure and fertiliser on the lawns to prevent anybody from peaceably demonstrating out there, if he can bring in legislation in a flash to offend in a most outrageous way the civil rights of women who want to participate in a march in Canberra, why is this sort of efficiency not brought to bear when the whole of the New South Wales electricity supply, and that in particular of the Australian Capital Territory, is placed in jeopardy? If instructions were issued, why did the Department of Defence flagrantly ignore them? Did someone in the Department of the Capital Territory forget to tell other departments that there was some sort of problem with the electricity supply in New South Wales? What sort of confidence can the people of Australia have in the Australian Public Service or the Ministers controlling the Public Service if this sort of rank disobedience concerning the spirit of saving electricity can be seen in the Australian Capital Territory?
       </para>
       <para>
        I am dwelling on this matter at some length. Under this legislation householders who contravene the electricity restrictions will be prosecuted and receive a $2,000 fine and corporate bodies will receive a $10,000 fine. Yet a photograph was taken last night of Russell Hill buildings-nine storeys of them- ablaze with lights. The Australian War Memorial was lit. I turn now to rather a quaint section of the Act. Section 35A in Part IIIA states:
       </para>
       <para>
        This part binds the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island, but nothing in this Part renders the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not suggesting that the Crown can prosecute itself. Public Servants can dream up this sort of ridiculous nonsense. What is being said in this Act is that some poor little householder out in Curtin or wherever can be caught by an inspector who, no doubt, will be speedily appointed by the Public Service to snoop around to see whether people have on one light too many. What are these vigilant people doing about the public servants or the head of the Defence Department who are responsible for having on every light on Russell Hill? Will anything be said or written to the permanent head or the Minister of that Department to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are administerd with some uniformity? Can the Minister provide me with a rough percentage of the electricity used in Canberra by the Crown? In other words, what is this Bill about? Can the public servants in the chamber advising the Minister-I wish one of the two would remove the cynical, self-effacing smile from his face as I am talking; I regard that as a personal insult-advise him of the rough percentage of electricity used in the Australian Capital Territory by the Crown as distinct from either private industry or private householders.

         —I thank the Senate for its multilateral support of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Amendment Bill. Clearly, we would all like to see it passed as quickly as possible. Senator Walsh certainly does. I will address myself to one of two points raised during the debate. Firstly, in regard to the level of savings that have occurred in the use of electricity since the calls by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) and by other persons for savings , it is recorded that during yesterday the amount of electrical energy saved was of the order of 9 per cent as compared with the previous Monday. As I understand , although we do not have final information, this has carried though with possibility some increase in saving for Tuesday compared with Tuesday of last week. To some extent the voluntary co-operation of the people of the Australian Capital Territory is working and we have seen some benefit.

       <para>
        In regard to the points raised by Senator Chipp during his few remarks just now , I can report that the Crown uses about 30 per cent of total electrical energy provided to Canberra and about 70 per cent is utilised, I take it, by all other sources. I have not a breakdown as to whether this represents private domestic consumption. Perhaps we will be able to obtain that information for Senator Chipp at some later stage.

As to other matters undertaken by Ministers other than the Minister for the Capital Territory, I assure Senator Chipp that all Ministers have been aware of this problem. I am sure that all would have spoken to their permanent heads and issued instructions in connection with their own departments to achieve voluntary restrictions where possible. Indeed, I can vouch for the Department of Veterans' Affairs in that regard. Of course, in respect of the Senate and Parliament House in general we have seen the surrounding gloom here today, at least on the Senate side.

Am I right in assuming that the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority is seeking as a target a saving of electricity consumption in the Australian Capital Territory of 15 per cent? Whilst 9 per cent might be a saving that one might be pleased about to some extent, it is just a little more than half way towards the target. The second comment I make is that it is crystal clear that at least the permanent head of the Department of Defence and the permanent head of the department that controls the War Memorial-I do not know which that is- deliberately ignored a request from the permanent head of the Department of the Capital Territory to conserve electricity. I invite the Minister to comment. Does he not think that that is a very serious breach? If he agrees, will he bring that to the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who might send out the necessary rebukes?

       <para>
        Where the Minister is satisfied that the supply of electricity available in the Territory is, or is likely to be, so inadequate for the needs of the Territory as to require the restriction of the use of electricity in the Territory, the Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, declare that an electricity supply emergency will exist during a period (in this Part referred to as a ' period of electricity supply emergency') specified in the notice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the Minister's second reading speech where he says that the Territory currently derives 60 per cent of its bulk supply of electricity from New South Wales, the balance coming from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. That highlights how much at a disadvantage the Australian Capital Territory would be if we did not have the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. I recall a previous Liberal Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, boycotting the opening ceremony of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority which was instigated under a Labor Prime Minister, Mr Ben Chifley. Mr Menzies said at the time that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority would be a white elephant. How those words have been thrown back at the late Prime Minister! We all realise, particularly the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, the problem we would now face if Mr Menzies had had his way and we had not gone ahead with the construction of the hydro-electric project in the Snowy Mountains. We would all be lighting candles and using fires in back yards on which to cook our meals.

        I remind the Senate once again that the Australian Labor Party has a lot of foresight regarding what should be done to safeguard the needs of the Australian community. Senator Carrick gets up in this place almost every day and castigates the New South Wales Labor Government because of the inadequate supply of electricity at present but I want to say that if it had not been for the foresight of a Labor government the people who now reside in the Australian Capital Territory would be using candles for illumination and cooking in a camp oven over an open fire in the back yard. I repeat that the Labor Party does have foresight when it comes to the national needs of this country. The entire Australian community should recognise that fact.

He made an appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the judicial inquiry requested more than two and a half years ago by the Vietnam Veterans Association. It is unfortunate that my colleague's appeal to the Prime Minister was ignored. He handed over the responsibility of replying to that appeal to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson). I will say more about that in a moment.

        Since the Australian and other forces invaded Vietnam a series of illnesses has beset those people. Most of them apparently have been caused by the types of defoliants and chemicals that were used there. The United States of America became alarmed at some of the results as far back as 1969 when it ceased the use of dangerous defoliants. However that decision was not taken in relation to the Australian troops and the areas in which they operated. Much of the responsibility for this must fall on the present Prime Minister who, at that time, was the Minister for Defence. He was the Minister for Defence from November 1969 to March 1971. It appears that Australian troops were still using these types of defoliants as late as 1971 and possibly until the early part of 1972.
       </para>
       <para>
        Almost every ex-service organisation in Australia has backed the Vietnam Veterans Association in its call for a judicial inquiry. Incidentally, this includes large sections of the Returned Services League. Only the RSL hierarchy has strongly supported the Government in rejecting it. The Legion of Ex- servicemen and Women, the second largest ex-services body in Australia, has consistently backed the setting up of a judicial inquiry right from the start. However, the Government has planted its feet firmly on the ground and said no. After much beating of breasts and much beating of drums, the Government did set up an epidemiological survey. At the time we said it was too little too late and that it did not do the job for which it was established. The Minister and the Government have come to realise that it did not do the job. The survey has now been abolished. One of the strange things is that when the Minister representing Senator Messner in another place replied to statements made by Opposition speakers he apparently did not know that the study had been abolished. The result was a very lengthy Press statement released by Phill Thompson, the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Association. I agree with everything that is contained in it. Mr Deputy President, I have shown it to your predecessor and to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) and both have agreed to its incorporation in Hansard. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.

        PRESS RELEASE FROM THE VIETNAM VETERANS ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA
       </para>
       <para>
        The Vietnam Veterans Association is extremely disappointed that the Prime Minister was not prepared to answer personally the charges made against him in the Parliament last Thursday.
       </para>
       <para>
        The response for the Government to those charges by the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr David Thomson, was totally inadequate and factually wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some examples of his wrong statements are:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. The Minister said only the VVAA supports the judicial inquiry, among ex- service organisations. We wish to point out to the Minister that, on 11 August, 1981, at an RSL-convened conference in Canberra, 27 out of 28 ex-service organisations present (including the Korea and South East Asian Forces Association) voted to support an independent judicial inquiry. That inquiry has also been supported by the Senate, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Labor Party and the Democrats, among others.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. The Minister said that the RSL has not called for a judicial inquiry. In May , 1980, the RSL N.S.W. State Congresss voted, by 499 to 1, to support a judicial inquiry. The N.S.W. Branch represents about half the RSL membership. This decision was put before the RSL National Executive by Sir Colin Hines, N.S.W. President, on 7 September, 1980. It was not voted on because of statements made to that meeting by Sir William Keys, RSL National President. Sir Colin Hines said in 'Reveille' (March/April, 1981, Vol. 56, No. 2) that he had been overruled. A statement was made to that meeting by Major-General (retired) D. Vincent, who was Commander, Armed Forces, Vietnam, 1967-68, that he knew the chemicals were dangerous, but he was acting under Government instructions in ordering their use by Australian forces, and that he did not realise the full extent of the dangers until 1980.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. The Minister said that the Government had initiated a program of epidemiological studies. He is apparently unaware that his own Ministerial colleague, the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Senator Messner, announced on 15 February, 1982, that the Government had scrapped the major study.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. The Minister said that Government Departments are co-operating fully with the current inquiry being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Environment. Having discussed that inquiry at great length with the Committee and their Secretariat, I can quite categorically state that Committee Members have expressed considerable concern at the lack of co-operation they have had from all of the Government Departments involved (Veterans Affairs, Health and Defence).
       </para>
       <para>
        5. The Minister said that the VVAA does not represent Vietnam veterans. Without the VVAA, the RSL would not have done anything about our claims, there would be no Senate Committee inquiry, no government-sponsored studies, no counselling centres and no public concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. The Minister said only 63 veterans had visited counselling centres in Sydney and Adelaide since they were established. Our information is that those centres have had over 340 clients, and are having trouble handling the workload. Already they are seeking more staff. On 16 July, 1981, at a meeting in Canberra with the Minister for Veterans Affairs and his senior advisers, we proposed the type of counselling service which we believe was and is necessary. The Minister refused to accept our submission and established a much more limited service. Even though the current service is so limited, the already demonstrated level of demand indicates the problems that Vietnam veterans are experiencing, along with the effects of those problems on our families. In a recent article the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the Adelaide Counselling Service alone was receiving 10 clients a day.
       </para>
       <para>
        7. The Minister quoted two scientific reports as evidence for the Government's case that the chemicals were not linked with the long term illnesses now suffered by Vietnam veterans. The Government-appointed Repatriation Review Tribunal, in its 'Reasons for Decision' in the recent Simpson case, found that there was sufficient evidence of these links to award a pension to Mrs Simpson. It should be noted that, in that case, the RRT only considered evidence about the US dispersal of defoliants, and only phenoxyacetic herbicides at that, and did not consider other evidence of the use of chemicals by Australian forces. We have long pointed out, on the public record, our concern about both US and Australian forces' use of both arsenic-based Agent Blue and the organophosphate insecticide, Malathion. Has Mr Thomson personally read the 1967 Midwest Institute report which is quoted in the Parliament? Apparently not, for he would have found, for example, the following statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''Arsenicals, particularly the trivalent forms of arsenic, have long been regarded as either carcinogens or possibly as co-carcinogens. In either case there is reason to be wary of the widespread distribution of these materials until evidence of their long-term safety under the conditions of use has been obtained.'' (Assessment of Ecological Effects of Extensive or Repeated Use of Herbicides, Midwest Research Institute, 1967, pp. 163, 164).
       </para>
       <para>
        8. The Minister said that the chemicals used in Vietnam were, and still are, commercially available and used within Australia. There is a wealth of public evidence that most of the chemicals used in Vietnam were not of the same composition as those used in Australia, the US, and elsewhere, at the time or since. As the Minister should know, both because of his own military experience and his responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown, peacetime precautions often cannot be followed in wartime. The Government's own report, ''Pesticides Used In Vietnam Hostilities and Their Use in Australian Agriculture: A Comparative Study ,'' says: ''Once again, however, it must be stressed that difficulties are encountered during conditions of war which prevent the rigid adoption of precautions that can be applied in peacetime . . . Although the regulations were designed to protect personnel from potential adverse health effects, it is impossible to determine the extent to which they were met.'' (p. 32).
       </para>
       <para>
        9. The Minister defended strongly the public servants in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The real problem, for Vietnam veterans, is the attitudes of most of the senior management in the DVA. We are not critical of DVA junior staff who are restricted by these attitudes, and who in any case do not make major decisions. The appearances of the Vietnam Special Studies Group personnel from the DVA before the Senate Committee's inquiry have been less than impressive. My Association is concerned also at the recent speech made by the DVA Permanent Head, Mr D. Volker, where he foreshadowed major legislative and administrative changes to the repatriation system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary then, we are very concerned that the Government has still not examined the detailed evidence which we believe supports our claims. We are forced to repeat, yet again, our call for a judicial inquiry, outside the political arena, which can impartially assess that evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also disappointed that, despite mounting evidence in support of our claims, the Government's attitude to our problems is the same as it was over two years ago.

         —I do not intend to hold up the Senate but I pass these final remarks. I think the matter is summed up in the final paragraph of the remarks of the Minister for Science and Technology in another place who represents the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The Minister for Science and Technology said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The RSL is, and always has been, the main spokesman for veterans. I am proud to be a member of the League and I am delighted with what it said.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also have been a member of the RSL for many years and from time to time the RSL has done things of which I have not been proud. One of these occurred when it came out very vocally and asked for more and more troops to be sent to Vietnam. Now that we have a force in the Sinai Desert the RSL no doubt will come out with further calls to treble it. That is where we are going to have the next problem. Of course it is unlikely that we will need herbicides in that area to control foliage because it is all sand. The Minister may be pleased to know that whilst I have criticised him very severely in this chamber I now transfer my criticism to the Minister who represents him in another place. Apparently he does not know what is going on. Apparently he has not been properly briefed. If he has been properly briefed he has handled the matter like an amateur. That statement was made by a man who is still a brigadier on the reserve list. He should be keeping up to date with these sorts of things, particularly as he also holds the portfolio of Science and Technology.
       </para>
       <para>
        I appeal further to the Minister to use his good offices to establish a judicial inquiry. It will not cost all that much. We are spending money in other areas. I understand that the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) has postponed his major statement on the defence forces of Australia because he did not want to upset anyone over Easter but he will be making major announcements in two or three weeks time. This is probably consistent with the outlook of the Government . The money we could save there could be well directed-at least a tiny fraction of it; all we need is the petty cash-to set up the judicial inquiry. I hope that the Minister will take note of my appeal.

         —Tonight I draw attention, as I did last Tuesday night, to a Government decision to spend a considerable amount of money justifying its actions. I make no apology for doing so even though last week I brought forth the wrath of Senator Chaney, who accused me of speaking in the dead of night. Apparently this is an unjustifiable thing to do in this chamber. I refer, of course, to the remarkable decision of the Government to spend $300, 000 in publicising its Homes Savings Grant Scheme-a middle class gimmick of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) which is designed, of course, to divert attention from the interest rate increases and the failure of the Government to provide anything for the public housing tenant and the renter of private accommodation in the community. Less than a week after this decision was made-I point out that this decision was made in such a hurry that the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on housing policy delivered last Thursday was re-written at the last minute and the telexes announcing the scheme were recalled in the middle of the night-television advertisements will begin to appear. I suggest that they will keep on appearing until the blackout takes the electronic media out of the Victorian election campaign. I will refer to the relationship between this campaign and the Victorian election campaign shortly.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I contrast this with the refusal of the Government to spend not $100,000 or $ 300,000 but one cent on television advertising when the disadvantaged health care card scheme was introduced-a scheme which was relevant to hundreds and thousands of the poorest people in the community and people with the greatest language difficulties. Contrast that with the refusal of the Government to spend one cent on television advertising of the availability of pensions and benefits to the most disadvantaged in our community. Not one dollar has gone on either radio or television since this Government came to power with a ruthless determination, we are told, to keep down welfare expenditure as far as possible. If people do not know about benefits they do not have to be paid; they cannot apply for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1973 the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty found that there were some 17,000 poor householders who were entitled to social services who were not receiving them whether through-to quote the report-'ignorance or pride'. The Task Force on Departmental Information which reported to the Government last year found that socio-economic and information disadvantage usually go together and have a mutually aggravating effect on each other. People in these areas just do not know what is available to them. The means used by the Government to make information available to them is just not getting the information through.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) gave as the reason for having no paid radio or television advertising for social services the substantial cost. In Senator Guilfoyle's time as Minister for Social Security the publicity budget for pensions and benefits and other services of the Department was run down. Under the present Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) we have seen this budget deteriorate even further. The publicity budget for millions of people in this country eligible for pensions and benefits is only $586,000-an effective 50 per cent cut in the past five years. For a few potential applicants for the homes savings grant, and what I believe the Government sees as a lot of potential Victorian votes, the Government is spending over half of the whole social security publicity allocation largely on the electronic media. On the other hand, the Government is refusing to publicise , by the use of this media at other times during the year, benefits that are vital to the most needy. I might add that 36 per cent of advertising expenditure on the proposed homes savings grant is directed to Victoria, where only 24 per cent of the population resides. This is such a heavy-handed and obvious exercise that I believe the Victorian voters will laugh at the Government for undertaking it. My greatest regret is that $300,000 is to go down the drain in pursuing it. Such a sum could have restored to its 1976 level the publicity allocation of the Department of Social Security which, since that year, has suffered a 50 per cent reduction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight, on the program PM, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) said sanctimoniously, when questioned about his motives for the $300, 000 publicity burst 'If you want to accuse me of helping people, so be it.' That is something of which we could never, in the same context, accuse Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, Senator Chaney or the present Government when we look at the publicity budget that is devoted to social security recipients in this country. The Minister for Social Security, and everyone else in the Parliament, knows that the only person who he is trying to help by this outburst of publicity in the electronic media at the moment is Lindsay Thompson, the lame duck Premier of Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I have said follows what I said in my speech on the adjournment last week about that other exercise in government futility, the petulant action of the Minister in standing down hundreds of officers of his own Department and then spending $360,000 in the newspapers to justify his actions. As a result, he caused chaos amongst innocent claimants for pensions and benefits. I feel that I must make an explanation concerning figures that I quoted during that speech of a week ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said then that I believed the sum that had been wasted by the Minister and the Government in that futile exercise was just over a million dollars. I have learnt, from an answer supplied to me today by the Minister, that in fact the figure was half a million dollars low. Senator Chaney spent more than a million and a half dollars of the taxpayers' money in running down departmental morale and causing untold distress to welfare groups and the welfare clients of his Department. As at 1 March 1982, in addition to the $361,000 expended upon advertising, he had reimbursed the New South Wales Government and voluntary agencies to the tune of $1,160,525 or $1,522,315 all told. Therefore, I apologise to the Senate for underestimating the cost of Senator Chaney's bull-in -a-china-shop approach by more than half a million dollars. The Government should be condemned for wasting the taxpayers' money upon such self-justified propaganda. Equally, it should be condemned for its refusal to inform the poorer people of their rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        I propose to cite two more extracts from what was said by the Task Force on Departmental Information. The first is:
       </para>
       <para>
        Reaching the disadvantaged effectively costs more than reaching the general public . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Government has shown quite clearly that it is not willing to spend money to reach such people. The second extract is:
       </para>
       <para>
        Among Government officials especially we detected a fear that people would ' take advantage' of the services offered if they were publicised 'too widely'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, we have the Government and some bureaucrats claiming that they will not publicise benefits or services available to the disadvantaged because of a fear that they may actually take advantage of their rights under the legislation of this Parliament. In contrast, they are quite happy to publicise to a considerable degree a program which is aimed at middle class voters, who they fear during the Victorian election campaign are drifting away from them. We know, of course, that this will not save the Victorian Government. This expenditure is as useless as that of Senator Chaney during the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make no apologies for raising this matter, in Senator Chaney's terms, in the dead of night as the adjournment debate is the most appropriate time to draw the attention-as I did last week, as I do this week and as I will do in any future week-of the Senate and of the public of this country to the fact that this Government, which preaches economic restraint and says that it will cut Budgets, is only too willing, for cheap electoral purposes, to spend a considerable amount of money in the electronic media and in the newspapers when it thinks it will win votes, but it is not willing to do so to inform people of their rights and in fact continues to use old-fashioned and what it admits are ineffective methods of publicising those benefits which always go to the most disadvantaged members of our community.

I think he ought to be complimented for drawing the attention of the Senate to what the Government has engaged in today; that is, a form of public funding of elections. It announced in the other place today that it will extend $300,000 of taxpayers' money to endeavour to explain to the many home owners who are seriously disadvantaged because of high interest rates in this country just how this home loan package will operate.

        Most of us will recall during the 1977 election those full page advertisements which appeared in the daily Press in Australia depicting a person with a fistful of $5 notes. That might have been paid for by the Liberal Party. But then we all recall that in the 1978 autumn session of the Parliament the Taxation Office was instructed to place advertisements explaining to the people the reasons for the Government not giving back to the people a handful of $5 notes but in fact imposing upon them an extra income tax surcharge. We were able to flesh out during the Estimates hearings the fact that it was the first time ever that the Taxation Office of Australia had to carry out public advertisements at the behest of a government to explain why it was imposing an income tax surcharge on the taxpayers of Australia after having, just a few months prior to that, told the people that if they voted for the Liberal Party they would receive in return a fistful of $5 notes. That did not happen.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we see a repeat of that waste of taxpayers' money. The Government is trying to get itself off the hook and is trying to explain why it imposed the extra surcharge on the taxpayers of this country. I talk about the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, not the big taxpayers who have all the lurks in the world available by which to evade income tax. I talk about the people who have their income deducted from their pay packet every week or, like public servants and members of parliament, every fortnight. When we get our pay cheque our income tax has been deducted and we have no way of evading tax at all. The big taxpayers can employ highly skilled lawyers to evade paying the income tax that they should pay. I will not delay the Senate any longer except to say that the Government, despite the fact that it is opposed to public funding of elections, blatantly admitted in the House of Representatives today that it will expend $300,000 of taxpayers' money to get its story across and to try to tell the people what is in it for some of them with regard to this home loan package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course we all know that whilst some people might be advantaged by what the Government is offering, more people will be disadvantaged because at this time they have to pay an extra one per cent in interest on their home loan. We are well aware that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Hayden, said that before the end of the financial year people will incur another one per cent interest rate rise. It is anybody's guess what the rate will be by the end of the year. It could be, as the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, has said, that people who are encumbered with home loans from banks and lending institutions will pay interest at the rate of 18 per cent. No wonder the Government today is going to expend $300,000 of taxpayers' money trying to get itself off the hook. It is in a situation which it has created and it cannot blame anybody else for it. It is just purely mismanagement of the economy of this country. I join with Senator Grimes in rising tonight and saying that the Government deserves to be criticised most strongly for the actions it has taken in this respect.

         —Before coming to Senator Keeffe's remarks I want to answer one or two points raised by Senator Grimes. He claimed that the Government had initiated a program of expenditure of $300,000 in respect of housing advertising. I understand that is correct; a program has been entered into for the advertising throughout Australia of the new Homes Savings Grant Scheme. I believe that to be a very reasonable proposition when one considers the great deal of confusion that must exist in the minds of some people who perhaps have already made application under the previous Homes Savings Grant Scheme and who were no doubt contemplating making application under the new scheme. There surely is a great need to bring to the attention of those people the changes in the scheme as enunciated by the Government last Thursday. If Senator McLaren and Senator Grimes do not agree with that proposition I would be very surprised to hear it. Clearly we would not want a situation to continue to exist where people misunderstand the nature of the package which was announced last Thursday. Consequently, the proposals are and should be promoted as publicly as possible to correct misunderstandings in people's minds.

       <para>
        As to the reasons why there is so much proportionately-I think this was a point that Senator Grimes raised-being spent in Victoria compared with New South Wales , it is pertinent to realise that the costs of television advertising on Melbourne media are substantially greater per unit than those of advertising on the equivalent Sydney media. I think those matters can be quite easily checked. The main reason--

         —It would be pretty hard to teach him anything, I must agree. We will have another go tomorrow night. He should try it again at Question Time tomorrow. It is true that Melbourne television does extend into the country areas of Victoria to a far greater extent than does Sydney television extend into the country areas of New South Wales. Consequently it is pretty clear that the rates which are being charged by television companies in Melbourne would be far higher than those for Sydney, as they are reaching a far greater audience. I think that substantially the Opposition's claims in connection with this package of expenditure on advertising are unsoundly based. Consequently, the Government rejects that form of criticism.

The point about it is that having seen the document the honourable senator incorporated in Hansard, which I understand is substantially a Press statement attributed to the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, Mr Phill Thompson, and which I understand emanated from the office of Mr Clyde Holding in this Parliament House-if it did not, it certainly was delivered to my office from there this morning-I think several things should be said about it.

I assure him that it came from that Association. It is a quite wrong inference to say that it emanated from someone' s office in this building. Things come out on behalf of various other organisations from offices of members of the Liberal Party. I do not take any exception to that if they have the facilities for distribution. The statement was made by the very worthy President of the Vietnam Veterans Association.

         —The only answer I give on that point of order is simply that Mr Phill Thompson is in continuous contact with my office. He knows where it is. I was surprised that I did not receive a copy of the Press release from him directly and that rather it came from Mr Clyde Holding's office. I find that somewhat unusual.

       <para>
        I think we should understand that, of a total number of veterans who returned from the Vietnam war of 45,000 or thereabouts, the Vietnam Veterans Association speaks, we understand, for a few thousand-probably fewer than 3,000. Eight thousand Vietnam veterans are members of the Returned Services League. Many are members of quite separate battalion and regiment associations. The Vietnam Veterans Association is not the sole source of information about the problems of Vietnam veterans which come to governments. Consequently, this Government has to consider all interests in this regard and take into account the statements of all people in relation to the problems of Vietnam veterans. As I said earlier, I would prefer to deal with many of the detailed matters which were raised in the Press statement in greater detail when we come to debate the repatriation legislation. Suffice it to say that many of the statements in the Press release are erroneous and obviously slanted to present one point of view. They take account of pedantic differences in wording made by individuals over a period. If that is the kind of debate to which this matter has now descended I am sorry. It does not say much for the Vietnam Veterans Association or for any other group which is trying to promote a very worthwhile cause.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that the Government's interests in this matter are quite clear and have been made so over the last 15 or 18 months. It has to find answers to the herbicide question, provide treatment for those who need it, invite people into the repatriation system, test their eligibility for compensation and see whether it can solve the problems which, in many cases, are manifest. Senator Keeffe knows clearly this Government's policy and this Minister's policy in that respect. We are seeking, through those various means and through the establishment particularly of free treatment of people in urgent need and counselling centres in each capital city in Australia to assist those who have a very real need. To reduce the debate to this level is beyond all the pales that might be introduced into this place. I believe it reflects badly on those who seek to make a political issue out of the misfortune of veterans.

       (1) Yes. The Summary Report of the Working Party on Television Advertising of Foods Directed to Children was endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) at its 90th Session, October 1980. At the Council's 92nd Session in October 1981 the full Report of the Working Party was endorsed.

       (2) and (3) While no discussions took place between the NHMRC and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal prior to the establishment of the Working Party , the intention of the Council to take action in response to Recommendation 12. 50 of the Report 'Children and Television' from the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, and conduct the inquiry, was conveyed in a letter from My Department to the then Postal and Telecommunications Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       The establishment of the Working Party is consistent with the NHMRC's charter to inquire into, advise and make recommendations to the Commonwealth and the States on matters of public health legislation and administration and on any other matters relating to health, medical and dental care and medical research.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question of food advertising had been a concern to the Council's Nutrition (Standing) Committee since 1973 and, while the Working Party was established partly as a response to the Senate Standing Committee's recommendation, its establishment was also as a consequence of expressions of the community and professional concern in the matter. As well, expert committees within the NHMRC had been considering, concurrently with the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee, the question of potential problems arising from advertising-directed to children-of certain categories of foods.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-under the terms of the Broadcasting and Television Act-is responsible for broadcasting standards throughout Australia, arrangements were made for the Tribunal to be represented on the Working Party. However, the major consideration of the inquiry was related to the nutritional, dental and other health consequences of food advertising. The subject of the inquiry was within the ambit and competence of the NHMRC.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) As regards implementation of the Working Party's recommendations, the proposals have been referred to State and Territory health and education authorities, industry and professional organisations for consideration. Recommendations relating to nutrition education and research are presently under consideration. Also, the NHMRC has endorsed the establishment of a Working Party -comprising representatives of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the advertising and television industries-to develop guidelines for television advertisements for children.
      </para>
      <para>
       In response to a recommendation from the Working Party that information on the constituents and nutrient composition of new foods entering the market place be published, the NHMRC is currently funding a food analytical program to provide data on the nutrient composition of Australian foods.
      </para>
      <para>
       Broadly, the Recommendations of the Working Party reflect the Government's present policy favouring industry self-regulation as regards advertising practices.

      <para>
       Can the Minister assure the House that after the recent experience of HMAS Sydney and the earlier experience of the United States Navy with the United States ship Belknap that the Government will not order warships which have aluminium in their structures? Is it true that if HMAS Sydney had not been constructed largely of aluminium the main deck would not have warped and the damage would not have been nearly so extensive? Do both Royal Canadian Navy and the British Navy refuse to use aluminium in their ships because of the vulnerability of this material to fire?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The susceptibility of aluminium in a major fire is recognised and was well demonstrated in the fire on the USS Belknap in 1975. As a consequence of the Belknap experience the aluminium superstructure, above the steel main deck, in the FFG-7 Oliver Hazard Perry Class design is divided into three discrete fire zones, each zone being separated by fire insulation material attached to the aluminium bulkhead at the zone boundary.
      </para>
      <para>
       Fire detectors are also installed in these ships, and a fire such as that on HMAS Sydney would have been detected earlier had the ship been completed and in service and not unmanned as it was at the builder's yard.
      </para>
      <para>
       Ship design is a compromise of many conflicting requirements. Whilst the disadvantages of the use of aluminium in warships are recognised, its high strength to weight ratio make it a desirable construction material, particularly where weight savings are required. I am not able to give an unequivocal assurance that the Government would not order in the future warships with aluminium in their structure.
      </para>
      <para>
       The main deck of HMAS Sydney is constructed mainly of steel and there is no indication that this deck has 'warped', however, portions of the aluminium structure above the main deck (01 deck) were buckled in some places as a consequence of the fire.
      </para>
      <para>
       Aluminium superstructures have been used on British Navy warships; however it is understood that both the British and Canadian Navies do not favour the use of aluminium.

       The Commonwealth Government recognises the sovereignty of the Western Australian Government in regard to development agreements for major mining projects in Western Australia and does not intend to interfere in the comprehensive agreement that has been entered into between the Western Australian Government and the Ashton Joint Venture partners. That agreement provides, inter alia, for independent valuation and approval of marketing arrangements by the Western Australian Government but no proposals have yet been presented by the partners.

       However, the Commonwealth Government has a responsibility to ensure that the national interest is protected and, in exercising that responsibility, must be able to take whatever action it considers necessary. This is why no firm undertaking can be given that control over the export of diamonds will not be introduced although I reiterate that there is no present intention to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to the more general question about export controls which the honourable senator asked on 25 February, the purpose of the export controls on certain minerals is to safeguard Australia's national interests and, in particular, to ensure that Australia receives fair and reasonable returns for the exports of those minerals. These objectives are being achieved although no specific example can be provided because the Government has undertaken to the mineral exporting companies concerned that all aspects of its consultations with them and of contract negotiations will be kept confidential.

        —On 25 February 1982 (Hansard, page 477) Senator Tate asked me as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources a question without notice about diamonds and I undertook to seek information on one aspect concerning the role of the proposed Commonwealth valuer.

       The Minister for Trade and Resources has supplied the following supplementary information:
      </para>
      <para>
       As he has stated, he sees it as necessary, in order to carry out the Commonwealth Government's responsibility of ensuring that the national interest is safeguarded, that there should be a Commonwealth valuer who would periodically check the value of diamonds being exported. However, it is not possible to indicate what arrangements might be put in place, including the role of a Commonwealth valuer because the Ashton Joint Venture has not yet decided how Argyle diamonds will be marketed when production commences later this year.
