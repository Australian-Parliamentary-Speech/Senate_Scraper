Does the Federal Government make funds available to the Queensland Government for use by the Queensland Housing Commission? If so, will the Federal Government immediately notify the Queensland Government that the unbelievable policy of the Queensland Housing Commission relating to sterilisation must be discontinued before further funds are made available for its use?

It does appear to be an extraordinary statement by the Queensland Housing Commission. Of course, under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds are made available to the States for housing assistance. If this statement has been made by an official of the Housing Commission, perhaps the Queensland Minister will wish to make some comment on the statement. I will draw this matter to the attention of the relevant Commonwealth Ministers and see what action they feel is necessary to achieve a satisfactory outcome in relation to what appears to be an extraordinary statement.

The Premier and the Government of South Australia have been very diligent in working towards higher water quality for Adelaide and South Australia. There are two factors involved-salinity and what is called turbidity. A lot of organic matter is churned up, particularly around Murray Bridge-so Senator McLaren tells me; I had a look at that the other day-and that creates an unpleasant appearance for drinking water.

         —Wherever Senator McLaren was, things would be stirred up; there would be a degree of turbidity. The first stage of the filtration process for the Adelaide water supply, very heavily subsidised by the Federal Government, has been completed and the Premier announced recently the commencement of the second stage. That will be very good news for the people of Adelaide. The Commonwealth Government is very keen that this should continue. The best news on the salinity problem is that the River Murray Waters Agreement has been signed by all States. I will be introducing legislation relating to that agreement in this session. That, of course, enforces water quality control. It will be the biggest significant contribution to South Australia. Of course, the Commonwealth plays a major part in that.

        The Dartmouth Dam, which is functioning now, will enable a flushing, particularly at times of drought. If it were not in existence today we would have trouble with the Hume Weir and all the way down the river. The Maunsell report and its salinity recommendations are being acted upon. The Commonwealth Government is working with the States on a variety of anti-salinity processes. I will be associated with the opening of one within the next week. Taken all in all, in terms of both salinity and turbidity, the Commonwealth is working very earnestly and effectively with the State Government to bring about better water quality, both for drinking and for irrigation purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        One other thing is fundamental to the salinity problem, and that is that we must encourage better irrigation processes. We must try to abandon flood irrigation and utilise drip irrigation so that the salt table is not lifted and so that salt, which now amounts to about 1,250,000 tonnes a year, does not pass down the Murray River.

We will be bringing policies towards that end. Discussions are going on jointly with the various governments at the moment. Fundamentally, all good husbandry and farming should be based on an understanding that flood irrigation is a wasteful use of water and results in a dangerous lifting of the salt table. Orchardists in the area, in particular, have suffered very badly in the past from destruction of their crops by salt.

Will the Minister inform the Senate whether this gesture will also apply to other taxpayers who find themselves owing money to the Taxation Office, or will it apply only to those members of the business community who, while the Government turned a blind eye, were encouraged to avoid paying taxes on a gigantic scale?

         —I repeat: The Government took into account the fact that vendor shareholders who gained an extra amount by way of what ought to have been paid as company tax, taking it in as capitalisation of their shares, may well have invested that extra amount in businesses which employ people. Therefore, if there were a crash program to recover with immediacy, those whom they employ-Senator Button grins, presumably because he takes some satisfaction in this-may suffer hardship, which they do not deserve. I would have thought that everybody in this Parliament would have agreed with, and supported, such a measure. I repeat that it will not enable the vendor shareholders to escape their responsibility.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The fact is that the recoupment of money from vendor shareholders is not a recoupment in relation to a criminal practice. It is under the ordinary taxation laws relating to the recoupment of taxation that was liable to be paid and that the Government now requires to be paid. Therefore, penalties will not be imposed . As to the position of other taxpayers, it is my clear understanding that the Commissioner of Taxation has discretion to make arrangements with taxpayers if aggravated hardship is involved. There will be no difficulty in applying that provision in the future. Apparently Senator Button is opposed to this extension of time and to trying to prevent placing at risk the jobs of employees who have had nothing to do with this matter.

However, I would like to comment that the stockpiling of wool by the Australian Wool Corporation does appear to be one of the more successful exercises pursued in assisting the marketing of primary production. Clearly, the objective is to try to ensure a reasonably stable market. There would be no wish, in the administration of that legislation, to damage any part of the industry, whether it be the processors or the producers. Having made that background comment, I will ask the Minister for Primary Industry to advise on the specific point raised. However, I am sure that, in the administration of the wool stockpile and the powers that the Australian Wool Corporation has with respect to it, there would be concern to ensure an orderly market right through the spectrum, from the grower to the consumer.

         —It is not the normal practice to table opinions but I will examine the honourable senator's request and advise him and the Senate concerning that part of his question. As far as the intention of the original legislation is concerned, without having looked at the original second reading speech, it is my understanding that the intention of sickness benefits is to ensure that when somebody loses income or is unable to get income because of the intervention of sickness he or she is given some income support. The most common situation in which sickness benefit is provided is, of course, one in which somebody is in employment and ceases to be able to work and, hence, is without income. It is true that until the opinion was obtained, I think late last year or early this year, in the administration of that section attention was not directed to that part of section 108 which referred to the requirement that there be loss of income due to sickness. I am paraphrasing because I do not have the section in front of me.

       <para>
        I previously advised the Senate, and I think Senator Grimes in correspondence, that I am having that matter very carefully examined to see whether a change of policy ought to be brought about and the legislation amended. In the meantime, as again I think I pointed out to the Senate on an earlier occasion, the instruction which was issued by my Department in June makes the point that when sickness benefit is not payable because the sickness has not resulted in a loss of income there may be an entitlement to special benefit. In other words, it is not a situation in which my Department is not able to assist in cases in which people are without means. So, the position is presently covered. The early advice which I have had from my Department shows that what I would regard as a significant number of cases are affected by the ruling made in June. I have asked my Department for very early advice on the need for a change in the legislation. At this time I have not received that advice, or if advice has come into the office in the last day or so I have not seen it. I will undertake to give the matter very early attention and to advise Senator Grimes and the Senate on whether the Government proposes to introduce changes to the legislation.

The situation is that for some years we have had operating, without the benefit of any standing in law, a policy whereby grants have been made to non-government schools for purposes of acquisition of buildings, et cetera. It has been understood that a Commonwealth interest will remain for some years. We generally have had a write-off period of 20 years. Because of the uncertainty that has been expressed and because of the representations that have been made, the Government has been able to re-examine this matter. It is our intention to codify what has been practice over a number of years, to give legal clarification of the interests of non-government school authorities in grants which they have received. It is the intention of the Government to introduce an amendment to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill, at present before the Parliament, in order to give certainty in this area and to remove the uncertainty which has been the cause of the representations. At the moment, the grants which are made are made through the States. The States act as a conduit for the money. It would be necessary then for the States to acquire extra responsibilities as a result of this codification. I am in the process of consulting State Ministers. The amendment will be in the Bill when it comes to the Senate.

         — With regard to Father Brian Gore, the Australian Embassy in Manila has been advised that warrants of arrest have been served on Father Gore. The local Press reports that he was arrested with six other people on 18 October on charges relating to the possession of explosives and of inciting to rebellion. The Embassy has been in contact with the authorities in Manila and is awaiting a full report from an Embassy official who went to obtain first hand information. The Embassy has kept up with developments from the outset. An officer of the Embassy has travelled twice to see Father Gore and to offer consular assistance. The Department of Foreign Affairs has been reporting directly to Father Gore's parents since the case began. As far as the other persons referred to by Senator Primmer are concerned, I will need to seek further information. I have noted that he has requested that the Minister deal with the Philippine authorities in Australia to see what can be done to assist. If there is any further information on those people, I will ensure that early advice is given.

It has always been the practice that the Treasurer of the day is not provided with personal details of income tax matters. There are arrangements under other Commonwealth Acts whereby information may be exchanged, usually for the functions of other government departments, such as the Department of Social Security, and for the protection of the revenue.

Legislation will be coming forward to provide for areas of avoidance. The legislation will come before the Senate. It will prevent vessels of over 200 tonnes from coming within an area of avoidance of the rigs. Already, there is a total prohibition area around the rigs. A number of surveillance methods-such as radar and other methods which are necessarily confidential-are being installed. These will strengthen the situation. Aerial and naval patrols continue.

One would hope that all South Australians would be happy about that. The fact is, as I have said, that the Tonkin Liberal Government has made enormous strides in attracting industry to South Australia. It is true that the liquids pipeline, which has been completed ahead of time, is a quite significant project. I repeat that it will carry up to 40,000 barrels of liquids a day without pressure and 80,000 barrels a day under pressure. To give the Senate an idea of the magnitude of that project, 80,000 barrels a day would be one-fifth of the Bass Strait production. That will be an enormous contribution to safeguarding Australia's petroleum security. One should be eager to encourage that.

        It is true that at Stony Point, which I visited, a considerable amount of construction is going on to separate the liquids and the gases and there is in contemplation what is to be done in the longer term with the products. There have been discussions over the years about the construction of petrochemical plants. That has been delayed somewhat because of the world recession and because a lot of stripping instead of flaring of gases is now going on in the Middle East, so there is some competition. But as the world moves out of the recession there is every reason to believe that it would be competent to have petrochemical industries within South Australia. That is particularly the case because the one thing in South Australia that we normally decry-salt-is a very valuable asset, along with ethane, in a petrochemical works. I know that the Premier, Mr Tonkin, has been very active in that regard. The Premier yesterday made signals to Queensland suggesting that the pipeline from the Jackson field, which is under development, might link with the Moomba field to go to South Australia. It would be a cheaper construction and would increase the quantity of fluids carried. It is exciting that the Jackson field should be showing commercial tendencies. It is interesting to see the discussions in the various States as to the route that these fluids will take.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress that on top of that is the story of Roxby Downs, of Honeymoon and of the new discoveries of coal which look commercial. Week by week there are more announcements that, under the drive and energy of the Tonkin Government, new industries are coming to South Australia which will, given the support of the Tonkin Government, mature in the immediate years ahead, giving more employment and more incentive to the people of South Australia.

In the event that two replacement vessels are chosen, will the Government ensure that Devonport and Burnie, as the principal north-west ports of Tasmania, obtain those replacement services?

At that time I pointed out that the Government was at a fairly early stage in assessing the propositions coming from five persons or companies which had interests in this proposal. Those matters are receiving attention at this stage but further discussions will need to be arranged and undertaken between the Victorian and Tasmanian governments in relation to the overall future arrangement.

        In relation to the particular matters which Senator Tate drew to our attention- the four-port system and matters of that kind-they seem to me to be elements which may be inherent in any propositions which are currently under discussion by the Government. Consequently, I believe the best line of action to take at this time would be to refer to the Minister Senator Tate's concerns in this area so that they might be used to reinforce any decisions that might be taken or discarded according to what is deemed by the Government to be the best course to follow at the moment. I understand the matter is still in a state of flux. It is possible that other operators will seek to take part in this new service if and when it becomes available. Senator Tate's valuable suggestions will be drawn to the attention of the Minister.

         —The responsibility of the Commonwealth for the broad income maintenance programs which are administered largely through my Department but also significantly through the Department of Veterans' Affairs is, I think, well understood. Providing what is commonly termed 'emergency relief' for those who require short term assistance is a matter on which there has been considerable debate. It is undoubtedly true that over the last year or two there has been a significant increase in demand for emergency assistance. The Commonwealth has been putting a constant amount of money in for emergency assistance, a relatively small contribution to meet the overall demand. This is in the context of emergency relief traditionally having been in the hands of State governments and voluntary agencies. Indeed, the question asked by Senator Elstob relates primarily to the burdens borne by voluntary agencies.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Pursuant to the Commonwealth's responsibility, a series of adjustments to income maintenance programs has been made. There are to be further changes in the new year which ought to do something to reduce the burden which is carried by the voluntary agencies; changes such as the increase in supplementary assistance, the variations to the limits on income which can be earned in part time work without affecting the benefit, the extension of a new form of pharmaceutical benefit to those pensioners and beneficiaries who do not have the pensioner health card, the basic indexation of pensions and benefits and the making of indexation level adjustments to non-indexed benefits. These are all steps which contribute to a solution to the problems raised by the honourable senator. But I would accept that, notwithstanding those changes, there will be, and is, a continuing demand for emergency relief. It would be my hope that the sorts of adjustments to which I have referred would help to keep those demands within manageable limits.

        Australia would benefit from any price reduction achieved. We would support Secretary Lehman's efforts to obtain that. There would be some consequences for Australia's FA18 acquisition and the Australian industry program if the United States program were curtailed. Similar consequences would arise for other nations that are purchasing the FA18. They include Canada and Spain. I think the point to be made is that, except for that relationship, the implications would be expected to be favourable as any price reduction would certainly favour this Government.

In particular, I draw attention to the claim made by the community child care movement that the recent Budget allocation of $200,000 for a pilot project which gives low income families a subsidy to use a commercial child care centre is 'a first step towards directing government money from the public to the private sector'. Is the Minister aware that in North America, where many public centres have been forced to close as a result of subsidies being shifted from public to private care, commercial child care chains, which have been dubbed 'Kentucky Fried child care', have flourished? In light of this overseas experience and the strong opposition to commercial child care from a broad range of groups throughout Australia, I ask the Minister: Will he assure the Senate that the pilot project does not signify a fundamental shift in directing government moneys from public to private care and that the Government will do all possible to increase its funding of public centres so as to provide good quality care for everyone who needs it?

I can assure the Senate that the $200,000 pilot project announcement which was contained in the Budget does not represent a fundamental shift in the approach which the Government has adopted in this area. I was pleased to be able to announce the Government's decision to proceed with that initiative in the context of a very considerable increase in funding for non-commercial centres. The increase in child care funding this year will enable an expansion of activity in that new projects will be able to be approved but, just as importantly, there can be an upgrading of subsidies, in particular those available to people on low incomes who might otherwise be excluded from Commonwealth-funded centres. So the $200,000 proposal was produced in a context of significant additional assistance being given to the non-commercial sector.

        I have heard some reports about commercial child care chains in the United States. I comment that there are significant differences between the United States and Australia in terms of the societies of the two countries. There are certainly significant differences in the approach to enterprise and various other things. In any event, I think there is a well-established public child care chain in Australia. The State governments are involved in the supervision of standards. There is a very active lobby which watches the interests of consumers in this area. I really think that there is no prospect of the sorts of difficulties raised by Senator Missen occurring in Australia.

       <para>
        By running this pilot project, the Government is seeking to establish whether it can effect a significant lift in the standard of care available to some children who at the moment might not have access to any form of supervised care- certainly not to a Commonwealth-funded centre-but who might have geographic proximity to a commercial centre and not be able to afford to go there. We are anxious to have a pilot which will be conducted in conjunction with State authorities and which will be watched by the voluntary sector both formally and informally. I believe that through this pilot we can contribute to our knowledge of how we can best ensure the provision of reasonable standards of care for all Australian children. It remains true that a very tiny minority of Australian children are cared for in formal child care facilities. We are anxious to ensure that in that other minority of cases-in which children are cared for in unsupervised conditions away from their families-the best available option should be open to them, whatever their economic circumstances.

Is it a fact that a memo was issued to all Commonwealth Employment Service managers instructing them not to insert employer-paid job advertisements in the Press for any vacancies which are normally handled by the private employment agencies? Does the Minister not agree that this action will deprive the CES of many vacancies it would otherwise have got and, therefore, reduce its effectiveness as a job placement agency?

         —I am trying to see whether I have any advice on the particular point raised by the honourable senator. I do not have any personal knowledge of the matter which he has raised. I do, however, have a note from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations which refers to some Press reports which may be relevant. It says that there has been an incorrect attribution of the loss of certain Commonwealth Employment Service functions to the private agency lobby. Following the implementation of the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions professional employment offices were absorbed into the CES network, employer-paid advertising was restricted and Templine was abolished . These decisions were made independently of the private agency lobby and were made in line with the Government's general aim at the time to devolve functions to private enterprise where appropriate. The CES continues to deliver a service to all job seekers and employers who wish to use the CES services. I will examine the written record of the question asked by Senator Foreman to see whether it needs a more detailed and specific reply. If it does, I will let him have that as soon as possible.

         —I do have some information on this matter. The question of the date of completion of HMAS Success is very important. It is true that the program is well behind schedule. It is the subject of continuing negotiations between the Royal Australian Navy and the Department of Defence Support and the builder. I cannot at this stage give any indication of the outcome of those negotiations. They are well in progress at present. It is true that the problems which have occurred at the builder's yard-the builder is Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd-relate to the attracting and retaining of suitable skilled workers after a long gap in shipbuilding at that dockyard. Also, one very significant contribution to the delay has been industrial disputation because that builder has been a target for the unions' shorter working hours campaign. Consequently, that has led to a very significant addition to the time taken to build this vessel. The difference between the production documentation received from the French and the documentation available at the time of tendering, as well as some deficiencies in the production documentation which have since been rectified or are being rectified with the ready co-operation of the French source, are matters that have contributed to the delay also.

       <para>
        In relation to that part of Senator Lewis's question as to whether the French and/or the South Koreans could build a ship in less time than it will take to build HMAS Success, it has to be acknowledged that Australia's policy in relation to this kind of development is for work to be undertaken in Australia. Consequently, the question of vessels being built in other countries does not arise. That, of course, is distinct from the matter relating to which design might be utilised. Of course, that brings us back to the delays which have been attendant upon the determination of the exact specifications on the French design. For those reasons there is very considerable concern on this matter. The Government is proceeding with it in all haste in order to bring about a speedy resolution of the problems which the builder is currently experiencing.

Yesterday Senator Evans also gave notice of his intention to move a motion on the same subject. Senator Evans has seen the document I have which represents a response to his question asked yesterday, together with some comment on his notice of motion. With his agreement, I propose to respond to the question by seeking leave of the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard a statement which relates also to the motion of which he gave notice. I think there is now a fair amount of common ground between us on the issue of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. There is an express statutory provision in the Public Accounts Committee Act which gives witnesses the same privileges as they have before a court. Section 19 of the Act is referred to in the statement which I seek to have incorporated in Hansard. That is one matter.

        Statement by the Minister representingtheActing Attorney-General,Senator F. M. Chaney

        21 October 1982
       </para>
       <para>
        This motion and the question asked by Senator Evans yesterday is concerned with what is essentially a question of law. It is not a simple question of law but, as I see it, a question of law of some complexity. Some may wonder, and I am amongst them, whether the Senate is really the place in which to seek to debate a complex issue of law of this character. But since, the motion is before us and the motion is for debate, we really have no alternative but to debate it.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the outset let us be quite clear what the motion is about and what it is not about.
       </para>
       <para>
        The motion is not about whether legal professional privilege has been waived in this case or whether it should have been waived by the Government in this case or whether it should now be waived. Indeed, the Government has now waived privilege in this case and the Public Accounts Committee has been so advised. What the debate is about is whether there was any foundation for the claim of legal professional privilege that was made by the Crown Solicitor before the Public Accounts Committee on 19 October.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, let us look at what are the relevant facts. By summons dated 6 October 1982 addressed to Mr B. J. O'Donovan Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee acting under section 13 of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 summoned the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor to appear before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on 19 October 1982 at 10.30 a.m. Honourable Senators will observe that Mr O'Donovan was summoned, not in his personal capacity, but in his official capacity as Commonwealth Crown Solicitor .
       </para>
       <para>
        That summons was received in the Crown Solicitor's Office on 11 October 1982. During the week commencing 11 October 1982, the Crown Solicitor was in touch with staff of the Public Accounts Committee and acknowledged receipt of the summons. In course of discussion with officers of the Public Accounts Committee it emerged that Mr O'Donovan's attendance was required at 9.00 a.m. on 19 October and not at 10.30 a.m. as the summons indicated. Mr O'Donovan attended on the Committee at 9.00 a.m. on 19 October.
       </para>
       <para>
        The summons addressed to the Crown Solicitor required not only his attendance but also that he should produce to the Committee documents held by him concerning the doctors and organisations listed at attachment ''A'' to the summons. Attachment ''A'' set out the names of some 41 doctors and organisations all of them in the State of Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        There can be no doubt but that the Crown Solicitor attended before the Public Accounts Committee on 19 October as a witness before that Committee. He was there under compulsion of law. Sections 13 and 14 of the Public Accounts Commitee Act make that clear beyond doubt.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 19 of the Public Accounts Committee Act provides as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''(1) a person summoned to appear or appearing before the Committee as a witness shall have the same protection and privilege as a witness in proceedings in the High Court.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) A person shall not use, cause, inflict or procure any violence, punishment , damage, loss or disadvantage on or to a person for or on account of his having appeared as a witness before the Committee, or for or on account of any evidence lawfully given by him before the Committee.''
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of section 19 of the Public Accounts Committee Act is to confer upon a witness appearing before the Committee the same protection and privileges as a witness would have in proceedings in the High Court. The privileges of a witness before the High Court are not in any respect now relevant different from the privileges of a witness before any other court in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the privileges enjoyed in proceedings in the High Court and other courts in Australia is legal professional privilege. The rule with respect to legal professional privilege is stated succinctly in the second Australian edition of ''Cross on Evidence'' at paragraph 11.25 as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''Communications passing between a client and his legal adviser together, in some cases, with communications passing between those persons and third parties may not be given in evidence without the consent of the client if they were made either-
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) with reference to litigation that was actually taking place or was in contemplation of the client; or
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) if they were made to enable the client to obtain or the adviser to give, legal advice.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Unlike most other Honourable Senators, I have had the opportunity of looking at the files that were the subject of the claim for legal professional privilege. These files contain communications from the Victorian Regional Office of the Department of Health to the Victorian Regional Office of the Crown Solicitor. The communications from the Department of Health request advice. A typical communication has in it a paragraph to this effect-''We would be grateful if you would furnish the Department with your legal opinion as to whether there is sufficient evidence to be able to pursue the matter''. Accompanying that letter, there was, of course, a brief of evidence. In most cases, the brief of evidence is not in the possession of the Crown Solicitor or his regional office. It seems to me to be clear beyond doubt that that letter constitutes a communication made to enable the client to obtain, or the adviser to give, legal advice within the rule that I have quoted above. It is within that rule if the communication is a communication passing between a client and his legal adviser.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one minor exception. One of the files contains some material involving communications with a third party. It is my view, and the Crown Solicitor agrees, that legal professional privilege would not attach to those particular documents, that is, part of one file.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Crown Solicitor claims, and I agree with him, that the client in those cases is the Commonwealth, the body politic. Is then the Crown Solicitor a legal adviser to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the rule with respect to legal professional privilege? In my view he clearly is.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 55E of the Judiciary Act, in so far as it is here relevant, provides as follows-
       </para>

        and is for the purpose of so acting, entitled to practise as a solicitor in any Court and entitled to all the rights and privileges of a solicitor in each State or Territory whether or not he is, apart from this section, entitled to practise as a solicitor in any State or Territory.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Communications passing between the Commonwealth represented by any of its Departments and the Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth with reference to litigation, whether civil or criminal that is actually taking place or was in the contemplation of the client, or such communications, if they were made to enable the Commonwealth to obtain or the Crown Solicitor to give legal advice, attract legal professional privilege and may not be given in evidence without the consent of the client.
       </para>
       <para>
        As recently as June of this year, Mr Justice Ellicott in the case of the Commonwealth of Australia against Sidney Frost and Others upheld a claim of legal professional privilege made in a matter before a Board of Accident Inquiry established under the Air Navigation Regulations. The documents to which the privilege was held to apply were documents containing proofs of evidence taken by an officer of the Crown Solicitor's office from a witness employed in the Department of Transport, being proofs of evidence taken for the purpose of the Inquiry. That case would seem to be clear authority for the view that the fact that the legal adviser is the Crown Solicitor and the client is the Commonwealth is not a basis upon which it can be said that legal professional privilege cannot be claimed. In this respect, the present case as it seems to me, is stronger than the case decided by Mr Justice Ellicott in that for the purpose of ascertaining the privilege of witnesses the Public Accounts Committee Act itself equates the Public Accounts Committee to a Court.
       </para>
       <para>
        For these reasons, it seems clear that there was a foundation and a proper foundation for the claim of legal professional privilege made by the Crown Solicitor before the Public Accounts Committee. The privilege is a privilege of the client, that is to say, the Commonwealth. The privilege may, of course, be waived by the Commonwealth and as previously stated, it has been waived in this case. But, as I have said whether it is waived or whether it is not waived is irrelevant to the question whether there was a proper foundation for the claim being made.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one further matter on which I would wish to speak briefly. I understand that a view expressed by the Crown Solicitor to the Public Accounts Committee to the effect that documents on files in the Department of Health that had come into the possession of officers of the Department of Health in the performance of his duties or functions under the Health Insurance Act 1973 cannot be compelled to be produced before the Public Accounts Committee. I would myself agree with the view expressed by the Crown Solicitor.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sub-section (2) of section 130 of the Health Insurance Act is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        ''(2) A person who is, or has been, an officer shall not, except for the purposes of this Act, be required-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) to produce in court any document that has come into his possession or under his control in the performance of his duties or functions under this Act; or
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) to divulge or communicate to a court any matter or thing that has come under his notice in the performance of any such duties or functions.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Bearing in mind that witnesses before the Public Accounts Committee have the same privileges as witnesses before the High Court, it seems clear that sub- section (2) of section 130 protects an officer of the Commonwealth from being compelled to produce documents that have come into his possession or under his control in the performance of his duties or functions under the Health Insurance Act to the Public Accounts Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        Language similar to that used in sub-section 130 (2) of the Health Insurance Act is also used in sub-section (3) of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That provision was the subject of consideration by Dixon CJ in Canadian Pacific Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. Stapleton 86 CLR 1 at page 7. There His Honour said this-
       </para>
       <para>
        ''Sub-section (3) provides that an officer shall not be required to produce in Court (certain documents) or to divulge or communicate to any court any matter or thing coming under his notice in the performance of his duty as an officer except when it is necessary to do so for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act or of any previous law.''
       </para>
       <para>
        ''In spite of the word 'exclusion' in the passage that was read from O' Flaherty v. McBride, I think that this provision gives only a protection to the officer against compulsion and does not make inadmissible evidence which the officer is prepared to give under instructions from his superiors or the Commissioners.''
       </para>
       <para>
        The judgment of Dixon CJ in that case was affirmed by a Full Court of 3 judges .
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst it is clear that the secrecy provisions in section 130 of the Health Insurance Act do not prohibit the production to the Public Accounts Committee of papers coming into the possession of an officer in the performance of his duties or functions under the Health Insurance Act, it seems to me to be reasonably clear that the Public Accounts Committee cannot compel the production of those papers any more than a Court could compel their production.

         —by leave-I am glad to hear from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that the particular controversy relating to the production of documents to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts appears to have been resolved satisfactorily. Of course, if that is so, it will make it unnecessary for me to pursue the motion of which I gave notice yesterday. As to the statement which has been incorporated in Hansard by the Minister, which I have so far only had a fleeting opportunity to peruse, I do not want to be taken as acceding to all the matters there asserted. In particular, I do not concede that legal professional privilege was ever properly claimed in relation to the particular documents in dispute in this matter.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What I do concede is that, on the technical question of whether legal professional privilege can ever properly be claimed in proceedings before the Public Accounts Committee, the language of section 19 of the Public Accounts Committee Act does seem to put that beyond doubt. However, as Senator Chaney indicated, it remains the case that, for all other Senate committee inquiries and parliamentary committee inquiries generally-that is, where there is no explicit statutory provision of this kind governing the protection of witnesses- in my view legal professional privilege claims are clearly inapplicable. That seems to have been the view of the former Attorney-General, the late Senator Greenwood, and of the then Mr Ellicott, as Solicitor-General, in their paper tabled in the Parliament in 1972. It certainly remains my reading of the present law, although I acknowledge it is an area in which there can be argument. Whether it should be the law that witnesses be able to claim legal professional privilege in parliamentary committee inquiries generally clearly remains a matter for serious debate on another occasion.

         —Earlier today, Senator Robertson asked me a question which drew our attention to an article that appeared in this morning's Canberra Times claiming certain statements by an American Air Force brigadier. I have since had an opportunity to look at that article. I have determined that it is certainly an article of a speculative kind. It might be said that it really has a particular connotation put upon certain anticipated statements by that officer. But, while drawing attention to certain statements made last weekend by the Minister for Defence in relation to the training of B52 teams over Australia, it does not in any way change the original thrust of that statement. That statement , which the Minister for Defence put down at the Federal Council of the National Party last weekend, is a clear statement of the Government's intention in this regard. For the benefit of the Senate, I seek leave to have the Press statement which followed that announcement incorporated in Hansard.

        The document read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Defence, Mr Ian Sinclair, today announced new arrangements ralating to United States B52 navigation training flights over Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Sinclair was speaking at the Federal Conference of the National Country Party in Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Sinclair said that the Government had agreed to a US request for the frequency of some of these flights to be increased and for permission to be given for B52s to conduct low-level navigation training flights over certain areas of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. At present the aircraft were only operated over northern Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the new arrangements was to give the US greater flexibility in scheduling navigation training flights and to increase the training benefits that the B52 crews get from those flights.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Sinclair said there were two separate arrangements governing the conduct of existing B52 operations in Australia. The first of these, announced by the Minister for Defence on February 3, 1980, provided for pairs of B52 aircraft to travel each fortnight from Guam. In November, 1980, the Minister agreed that the frequency of these operations could be increased to once a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second arrangement was announced by the Prime Minister in Parliament on March 11, 1981. That arrangement provided for periodic deployments to be made through Darwin of B52s and associated KC135 tanker aircraft on sea surveillance missions over the Indian Ocean after conducting navigation training in northern Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new arrangements, Mr Sinclair said, would make it possible for some B52 aircraft to carry out navigation training flights over northern Queensland, then land at Darwin and subsequently conduct more low-level training over selected low jet routes in the Northern Territory and Western Australia before returning to Guam.
       </para>
       <para>
        The actual frequency with which the various B52 operations would be conducted would vary according to such factors as the USAF's operational commitments for the relevant aircraft, on aircraft maintenance requirements and on weather conditions. Altogether a monthly maximum of about 16 B52 flights might be made through Australia for navigation training and sea surveillance purposes although in practice the actual number was likely to be substantially fewer than this. Of these, up to three B52s a month may land at Darwin.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Sinclair noted that, as is the case with all the existing B52 flights conducted through Australian territory, the aircraft will be unarmed and will carry no bombs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The low jet routes to be used by the B52s in Western Australia and the Northern Territory are as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) commences south of Junction Bay, heading south passing to the east and south of Katherine, turns west to pass south of Kununurra, then north-east to terminate south of Daly river Mission;

        —by leave-Yesterday, Wednesday , 20 October, an article appeared on the front page of the Adelaide News headed: 'ALP tactics may delay new benefits deal. Threat to pensions and dole rises.' In part, the article stated:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Delaying tactics by the A.L.P. are likely to mean a range of new benefits will not be available from November 1 as promised by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       These include an indexation of all pensions, an indexation of the married unemployment benefit, an increase in the dole payments and the 50 per cent rise in family allowances.
      </para>
      <para>
       Promised tax cuts . . . . will not be affected.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the charitable part of the article, which I refer to in the interests of balance.
      </para>
      <para>
       I raise this matter because I am primarily responsible for stating the Opposition's attitude to legislation which comes into this chamber. Five days after the Budget was presented, I called a Press conference. At the same time, I distributed widely a Press release in which I said that the Opposition would not obstruct or delay the Budget. In the course of a Press conference, I said that the Budget was the Fraser Government's responsibility and that the Opposition will not oppose it. I said:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is his Budget-
      </para>
      <para>
       That is, Mr Fraser's-
      </para>
      <para>
       and he will have to live with the political and economic consequences of it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since that time there has been no statement by any Opposition spokesman which casts any doubt on that statement. On a number of occasions, the statement has been reiterated.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to the question of any possible delay of the Budget, I simply point out to the Senate that, on 11 October this year, the Government circulated to honourable senators, and to me and other Opposition spokesmen in particular, a proposed draft legislative program. In that proposed draft legislative program, it was indicated that there were 11 Bills which the Government wanted passed by the end of October. In a letter to Senator Sir John Carrick on 12 October, I indicated that the Opposition would ensure that those Bills were passed by the end of October as requested. Subsequently, of course, there has been another Bill added to that list.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should point out that in the draft business list circulated by the Government it was not the Government's intention to introduce Appropriation Bills before at least 9 November. The particular objection I take to the article to which I have referred is that not only is it incorrect and in a sense totally misrepresents the position of the Opposition, but also is it chronically bad and incompetent journalism. For example, it is suggested that the social security payments will be delayed. If the journalist who wrote the article in question had bothered to familiarise himself with what happens in the Senate instead of getting his information from the Prime Minister's office, he would have known that the day before he wrote the article the social security legislation was passed by this chamber without opposition. It was passed in two hours-between 3.15 p.m. and 5. 15 p.m.-on Tuesday of this week. The article in question appeared the following day. The article does not allege anything other than that the Opposition was delaying legislation which had already been passed by the Senate. Alternatively, the article is open to the construction that the Government is somehow running out of money. I do not think the Government could be running out of money on the basis of its suggested program for this sitting of the Senate.

        The report covers a year of record levels of activity for the client services, total measurable demand being up by some 17 1/4% over the previous year. Similarly, in the supporting services, some 9% more books and periodicals were processed than the previous year while demand on the Alert services was up by nearly 50%.

        A Client Assessment Survey carried out during the year sought the reactions of users to specific responses received for information and research requests. The overall result indicated a high degree of satisfaction with the work done but indicated that some attention is needed in ensuring the relevance of documents provided in response to questions.

       <para>
        Planning for automation is well underway with the expectation that electronic means of information retrieval and delivery will be routine in the New Parliament House. In the year under review the Statistics Group of the Legislative Research Service in particular greatly enhanced its computer capability and commenced the development of a number of major packages. These include a time-series and econometric analysis package, an election results data base and another consisting of the demographic profiles of Federal electorates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Parliament's Bicentenary Publications Project, an initiative of considerable national significance, was begun during the year and is administered and funded through the Department of the Parliamentary Library. It arose out of a lengthy consideration by the Library Committee concerning the appropriate way in which the Parliament might mark the Australian Bicentenary and the opening of the new Parliament House in 1988. The general framework of the project has been determined as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        an analytical history of the Australian Parliament since Federation
       </para>
       <para>
        a narrative history of the people and events connected with the Parliament
       </para>
       <para>
        a popular book explaining how Parliament works and
       </para>
       <para>
        a series of smaller and more specialised monographs prepared in conjunction with the major works.
       </para>
       <para>
        An immense amount of preparatory work undertaken in connection with this Project in 1981 enables me to allude to developments in 1982 and to tell honourable Senators that the author commissioned to write the analytical history is Professor Gordon Reid, Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University of Western Australia. Professor Reid was an officer of the House of Representatives from 1946 to 1958 where he was Serjeant at Arms from 1955 to 1958. The author commissioned for the writing of the narrative history is Mr Gavin Souter, a senior journalist with the Sydney Morning Herald and the author of a number of successful historical works including Company of Heralds, a history of John Fairfax Ltd.
       </para>
       <para>
        Expressions of interest are currently being sought from authors interested in writing the popular account of how Parliament works. Proposals for the writing of the monographs will be assessed by the Advisory Board which Mr Speaker and I have set up to advise us on all aspects of the Project, and by the Publisher to the Project when he is appointed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The year 1981 was a busy one for the Parliamentary Library and I am sure that all honourable Senators would wish me to thank the Library Committee for its services and to congratulate staff of the Parliamentary Library on their work and achievements.

No such report is available to honourable senators at this moment. Certainly the text of the statement by the Acting Attorney-General is not available. Honourable senators are put in a very invidious position when they are given a completely fictitious opportunity to make some sensible comment on a paper.

        The document read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The report I have just tabled deals with the subject of retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory. This matter was referred to the Committee for consideration after a proposal to repeal the present Trading Hours Ordinance contained in section 90 of the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981 , was debated in the Senate. During this debate it was agreed that the Government would not proclaim the relevant section of this Act until the Australian Capital Territory Committee had considered comprehensively the question of its implementation and the possible effects of deregulation of trading hours. It was further stated in the debate that the Committee should provide every opportunity for all views to be heard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee formally accepted its terms of reference on 10 September 1981, commenced its series of public hearings on 2 November 1981 and concluded its deliberations on the inquiry in less then twelve months after its referral. Initial response to the inquiry was overwhelming-in the four weeks immediately after advertising the terms of reference, about 4,000 pro-forma slips from individual shoppers, 200 form letters from small retailers, 60 form letters from individuals, 40 letters from small traders, 67 letters from residents in the Australian Capital Territory, as well as 50 major submissions from retailers, trade unions and interested organisations and individuals were received.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to provide an opportunity for interested parties to present their arguments, the Committee held a series of public hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. It was also decided in the concluding stages of the inquiry to conduct a series of inspections and informal discussions in the Northern Territory where trading hours, apart from liquor trading, are not subject to regulation. In all 68 witnesses, representing 38 organisations and seven persons appearing in a private capacity, gave evidence to the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current Trading Hours Ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory provides that the sale of goods in shops is prohibited on a Sunday, a gazetted public holiday, a weekday before 6.00 a.m. and after 6.00 p.m. other than a late shopping day when trading hours are extended to 9.00 p.m. and on a Saturday, that is not a public holiday, before 6.00 a.m. and after 12.00 noon. The schedule to the Ordinance specifies goods and classes of goods which are exempt from the provisions of the Ordinance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trading Hours Ordinance has been subject to a number of public inquiries and reviews and the difficulties associated with the enforcement of the Ordinance have been repeatedly highlighted at public inquiries. Due to problems associated with the lack of enforcement of the present legislation, the situation in relation to trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory is at present not satisfactory and some direct action is required to correct the anomalies in the present system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee has examined 'the manner in which deregulaton of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory . . . might be implemented having regard to the effect on retailers, employees and consumers', after having examined how trading hours operate in other States, and after having taken into account the special conditions applying in the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        In looking at the effect of regulation on retailers, it is recognised that certain constraints apply which make it difficult for total deregulation to operate. Retailers have entered the market on the basis that the hours of trading as set out in the 1962 Ordinance will continue to apply. Small traders are more vulnerable to sudden changes in legislation affecting their hours of operation than are larger retailers. Therefore, small traders would be greatly disadvantaged in an environment which changes overnight from one of regulated trading hours to one of deregulation. The Committee has taken this into account in its recommendations. Another point is that the nature of leases in large shopping complexes prohibits individual retailers from opening or closing at times which they are free to determine. The question of whether any increased costs associated with opening longer hours would be reflected in increased prices to consumers was not able to be determined by the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the effect of deregulation on employees is concerned, a lot of controversy has been generated by claims that deregulation will contribute to a further decline in the number of full time, permanent positions in the retail industry. The Committee considers that deregulation would most probably accelerate or at least continue the trend towards the structural re-adjustment of employment in the industry-away from full time to part time and casual employment. However, it is considered that this is an inevitable trend and major retailers have stated in evidence that only voluntary staff would be used on weekends. This would reduce the impact on the family and social life of employees on Saturdays and Sundays.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reference was made during the inquiry to results of surveys to determine public support or opposition to deregulation or extended hours of trading. The most recent survey results indicate increasing support for an extension of trading hours to include Saturday afternoons. The Committee acknowledges the shortcomings of such results but at the same time has included the latest findings as an appendix to its report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee, while favouring the general principle of deregulation, considers that the nature of the market place in the Australian Capital Territory, combined with the oversupply of retail space in areas of Canberra and a shortage in others, makes it difficult to recommend the immediate repeal of existing legislative provisions governing trading hours. It is impossible to accurately forecast the effect of deregulation because of the number of variables involved. It is also not possible to draw on the experience of comparable areas in Australia because of the special nature of the market place in the Australian Capital Territory and the fact that there is a general lack of experience of deregulation in other States.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, in reaching its final conclusions, the Committee wanted to arrive at a formula which would enable a move to greater flexibility in trading hours while not implementing full deregulation. It was considered that too many exclusionary categories of shops or goods would create problems of definition and legal interpretation and that therefore a single provision was preferable to a number of constraints. For this reason, it was decided to base the determination on the number of staff employed by any one retailer. The only restriction applies to major traders which are those employing more than 100 staff, whether in one or more shops throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee supports unlimited trading Monday to Saturday. This means that in addition to the hours presently allowed under the Ordinance, all shops will be free to determine their own hours of operation between midnight Sunday to midnight Saturday. Major traders will be excluded from opening on Sundays enabling small shopowners to be free to trade in an environment not dominated by the major stores.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Committee considers that any future reviews of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory be referred to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly.

       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the report just presented is the final report relating to a new air traffic services centre and control tower at Perth Airport, Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The initial report which recommended the construction of all works contained in the reference, except the control tower, was presented on 27 October 1981. The Committee recommended deferment of the control tower because at that stage a Master plan for Perth Airport had not been completed, and the Committee felt that both the siting and size of the control tower could pre-empt certain options for the ultimate development of Perth Airport.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report and the public hearings in relation to the control tower have been completed with the Committee and public fully aware of the four development strategies, and of the announced preference of the Department of Aviation for what is termed Strategy 1-In short, retention of the current runway system with all terminal development centred around the current terminal locations. The Committee thought it necessary to fully canvas the development options and to make a recommendation on a preferred development strategy for Perth Airport, before examining the narrower question of the control tower. Most witnesses giving evidence to the Committee chose to comment on the development strategies, and additionally, the Committee received from the Department of Aviation copies of all submissions it received from organisations and individuals commenting on the four development strategies proposed by the Department of Aviation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making its recommendation on a preferred strategy, the Committee acknowledges two constraints-firstly, that the final environmental impact statement will not be completed until November 1982, and secondly that the House of Representatives Committee on Environment and Conservation had just commenced its inquiry on aircraft noise at airports in and adjacent to major cities. The Committee, based on its study of the initial EIS, does not anticipate that significant environmental problems will arise.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in relation to the inquiry on airport noise, the Committee has taken pains to ensure that any recommendations that that Committee may make in relation to Perth Airport are not pre-empted. The Committee acknowledges that an aircraft noise nuisance problem exists in relation to Perth Airport, and has given this aspect considerable weight in recommending a strategy. A number of aspects of the aircraft noise nuisance have arisen at my Committee's inquiry into Perth Airport. These include:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) The night flight weighting formula used for preparation of noise exposure forecast recommended for change by the recent National Acoustic Laboratory report.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) Claims that NEF patterns are inaccurate because planes are not following the defined flight paths in and out of Perth Airport.
       </para>
       <para>
        (3) Conflict in information given by DOA in relation to areas likely to be affected by aircraft noise should a wide-spaced parallel runway be provided. It is necessary that definite information be gathered on this point, particularly as it affects suburbs such as Forrestfield and Gosnells. It would be a futile exercise if the noise problem is merely transferred from one residential area to another.
       </para>
       <para>
        (4) Some housing development still appears to be taking place in areas likely to be exposed to some aircraft noise nuisance. In its initial report, the Committee recommended the re-formation of the Western Australian Airports Committee, and sees the co-operation of all levels of government as necessary to reduce the likelihood of such problems arising.
       </para>
       <para>
        These matters have been passed on to the House of Representatives Committee on Environment and Conservation for their detailed examination. The strategy recommended by the Committee is basically strategy 4, with deferred provision of a wide-spaced parallel runway. The Committee recommends the provision of the wide-spaced parallel runway when traffic demands it or earlier if recommended by the House of Representatives Committee on Environment and Conservation. Very simply, strategy 4 provides for development of a wide-spaced parallel runway, and terminal developments to take place east of the current runways.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has therefore recommended a 60-65 metre high control tower consistent with its recommended development strategy.

      </para>
      <para>
       I present the official report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman. The delegation was led by the honourable member for Warringah, Mr M. MacKellar and included the member for Swan, Mr K. Beazley, the member for Melbourne Ports, Mr C. Holding, the member for Paterson, Mr F. O'Keefe, the member for Eden-Monaro, Mr M. Sainsbury, and Senator Kilgariff and myself. The visit to the Middle East took place from 10 to 21 January of this year. This was the first Australian parliamentary delegation to visit the area, and I sincerely hope not the last, for it is an area where increased contact can but benefit the three countries visited and Australia. It is an area of great wealth and progress where Australian industry can play a part.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the purposes of the delegation was to confirm and expand the goodwill of the Australian Parliament and people towards Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. In this regard I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Deputy Prime Minister on his visits to the region. His high standing in the Middle East certainly assisted the delegation in its task.
      </para>
      <para>
       The delegation's prime purpose was to gather information on the three countries visited, with a view to making recommendations to aid the formulation of Australia's policies on developments in those countries and the region generally . The delegation came away from the Middle East realising the vast potential for additional Australian trade in the area. The amount of development going on in the region at present gives us the perfect opportunity. The delegation saw cities and ports being created from scratch, with most building materials, expertise and labour being imported. It is to be hoped that Australian industry through our Trade Commissioners will grasp this opprtunity to expand trade with the Middle East. As the Middle East learns more about Australia, and vice versa, I am sure Australia's relations with these countries will go from strength to strength.
      </para>
      <para>
       Every country we visited expressed interest in sending students to Australia for higher education; I believe some students are already here, and hopefully the knowledge they obtain about Australia will greatly assist our future relations with the Middle East. In the report the delegation has recommended a number of areas where Australia's knowledge in agriculture can be utilised. The delegation has also recommended that cultural exchanges between Oman and Australia, particularly youth exchanges, take place. The Omanis are particularly interested in having an Australian youth soccer team visit their country. By visiting this area of the world we were able to dispel many myths, and that is why I see it as a high priority that members of this Parliament and Australian businessmen continue to visit the area in order to learn the history and the customs, so that our relations and trade with the Middle East can increase.
      </para>

       I would like to thank the Australian Ambassador in Jeddah, the Senior Trade Commissioner in Adu Dhabi, and their staffs, for the great assistance given to the delegation during our visit.

      <para>
       Initially I would like to refer-this is not reported in the Australian Electoral Office report-to the amount of assistance given by divisional returning officers in Victoria in the State elections. We have a rather strange system in Victoria where the 33 divisional returning officers become State returning officers. Added to that are about another 40 or 50 amateur returning officers whose quality varies from excellent to hopeless. I have to say that the 33 returning officers conducted the last State campaign with commendable efficiency and were able to get results in early and efficiently.
      </para>
      <para>
       The most significant part of this report is on page 5 under 'Legislation'. There we find the citizens amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, consisting of some five lines, and then the rest of the page is blank, as has been the Government's record in reforming the Electoral Act. Two years ago the Government amended the Electoral Act to take out any constriction on expenditure by individuals or parties in election campaigns. It promised at the time to set up an inquiry and come back with recommendations to amend the Electoral Act. The Harders Committee of Inquiry into Disclosure of Electoral Expenses has, I think, reported. For over a year the Government has had that report in its hands. It is still considering the matter. If we have an early election it will still be considering the matter so we will go into a second federal election without any restriction on expenditure by candidates seeking to be elected to either this chamber or the House of Representatives. I think it is disgraceful that that report has not been acted upon. I do not know what is in it, whether its recommendations are so complex and require such drafting skills that the Government cannot bring in any legislation. As well as that, two committees have reviewed the Electoral Act. The first committee recommended substantial changes but because the changes were so comprehensive and caused so much distaste to this Government, it had to set up a second inquiry. The second inquiry has progressed. According to information received during the Estimates committees hearings it reported long ago to the Government. Again the Government has the matter under consideration and review and we hear nothing about it.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that the Electoral Act needs urgent review. It has not been reviewed for almost 17 years, since 1965. Reviews were conducted in 1973, 1974 and 1975. The amendments were all rejected in this place by this Government. If anyone is wondering why the Government does not review the Electoral Act, it is simply because as it is currently constituted it is favourable to the Government . To use a football expression: 'If you are kicking with the breeze, why should you switch to the other end?' Nearly every aspect of the existing Act favours the Government. I do not place any blame for this on the Australian Electoral Office. It is not its job to criticise governments or to say they are working under an archaic electoral Act. But it is disappointing that every time we get one of these annual reports we find virtually nothing under the heading of ' Legislation'.
      </para>
      <para>
       One thing I would like to congratulate the Electoral Office on is its initiatives taken, particularly in the Lowe by-election, in trying to get the turnout of voters to the highest possible level. Instead of just sitting back and conducting the election in Lowe it sent two different lots of mail out to every elector in Lowe telling them there was a by-election and how important it was to vote. The turnout was higher than for a general election. There were other factors, notably the importance of the by-election, which contributed to that. I have known other returning officers actually sending out to each subdivision a note saying when the election is and where the nearest polling booth is so not everyone goes to the same booth in that subdivision. This results in an even spread, which is more efficient. I think that is a very commendable initiative by the Electoral Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       The only other thing I would like to say is in regard to the electoral officers conduct of industrial elections in unions. I believe the Electoral Office has been given an impossible task to run efficiently fair elections when union elections are referred to them. There are no uniform rules governing how those elections should be conducted. There are certain guidelines in industrial relations legislation. But the problem that has cropped up in the last few years is that because there are no uniform rules-no rules to say, for instance, in certain unions that when the votes are returned the name of the person who is voting must be on the back of it-all sorts of allegations of bodgie elections conducted by the Electoral Office are made. It is not its fault; it has to run those elections in accordance with the rules of the union, whatever those rules may be. I think it is time that the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations drew up a uniform code of electoral procedures in union elections and so avoid those things. Of course, if the Government cannot revise the Commonwealth Electoral Act I do not really give it very much chance of revising the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to effect fair elections within unions when they are conducted by the Electoral Office.

        —I believe that the annual report of the Australian Electoral Office is a disappointing document from a range of viewpoints. Most importantly, I suppose, it is disappointing for what it does not say rather than what it does say. The Office goes back a fair way in Federal history. However, I do not believe that in past years it has really done its job in a promotional sense. I point to one aspect and refer honourable senators to an answer given in the other place in August this year by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who has ministerial responsibility for the Australian Electoral Office. I wish to relate that answer to page 3 of the annual report of the Commonwealth Electoral Office, in which there is some discussion about automatic data processing. The report says that the Office is looking at this matter. It states:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The design is expected to include an on-line network connecting all Divisional Offices, Head Office and Central Office with computer systems to support roll maintenance, polling result collation and distribution, election arrangements, employment of polling officials and provision of management information.
      </para>
      <para>
       While there is some updating into the 1980s in respect of the Office keeping its records in order, what is the position in relation to updating our voting procedures? The very essence and basis of why the Australian Electoral Office exists and the very basis of the democratic system is the means by which we are able to record our votes and have the system operate efficiently and effectively .
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister made some extraordinary statements in his reply. I suppose we in this place listen to some rather odd answers. But when written down those answers become an almost alarming admission of ignorance. I quote from the House of Representatives Hansard of 9 September. Talking about why we should not go anywhere near computers in relation to elections the Minister said:
      </para>
      <para>
       It also needs to be taken into account that existing computerised voting systems are essentially giant adding machines.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, that would immediately lead one to the conclusion that the person who gave such an answer knows absolutely nothing about computers. He went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       This is satisfactory with first-past-the-post voting, but quite a different story when it comes to a preferential system, notwithstanding the advances of recent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am not quite sure in what year the Minister is living but he is certainly not living in 1982. One can get, for under $5, off the desk of a major department store a hand-held computer which will perform calculations of a most extraordinarily advanced kind. In other words, the technology had advanced way beyond the suggestion that computers are essentially giant adding machines. The information on which the Minister based his answer presumably came out of a handbook that was given to children in primary schools about 15 years ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       One, of course, only has to look at the American situation to find the range of mechanical devices which are used in the States. These devices have been used for a long time and are appropriate only in respect of the first-past-the-post system. A punchcard operation, which is able to take care of equally well both a first-past-the-post and a preferential system, is also used. There is no great difficulty with either of these systems. A number of States, such as Arkansas, California, Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota, are using optical scanners which can take care of any ballot operation one would care to name. The Minister's objection to our looking at and investigating other systems is absurd. Probably an objection which of much more substance is that of cost. Of course, cost has to be looked at in terms of cost outlay for ensuing elections and cost recovery during the elections that a system would be able to service.
      </para>
      <para>
       As Senator Robert Ray has already pointed out, the Australian Electoral Office conducts not only Federal polls but also polls in respect of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, as well as miscellaneous polls such as those on industrial matters. A system adopted by the Australian Electoral Office could, simply by agreement with the States, be used for local government and State elections. In other words, the system could be employed constantly. It need not be like the one-off method that we use at the moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, we acknowledge that our elections are costly. I think that this fact is accepted by everybody within a democracy. But let us look at the type of cost savings we might be able to achieve as well as the cost efficiency we would be able to gain by making use of computerised systems. The Minister outlined the reason why the Australian Electoral Office is not engaging in any of these activities. He also informed us that the Australian Electoral Office does not even have a listing of recent articles on this substantial matter. This is a most extraordinary admission to make about the major body in this country which looks after Federal elections. The Minister in his answer said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The polling booths are not necessarily on Commonwealth property, fixed from one election to another . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       This is certainly the case. However, with a little bit of lateral thinking one could easily move them to property which is either Commonwealth or State owned. I make two suggestions. We have throughout this country, although we are rapidly closing them down, a very large number of post offices. We have also primary, secondary, tertiary and further education, university and colleges of advanced education facilities throughout the country. A combination of just those two groups of organisations would allow us immediately to put computers on line. This could even be done by telephone linkages. Almost all of the post offices and schools that I have mentioned would be linked to a telephone.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, the absurdity of the objections comes clearly into focus when we look at the Totalisator Agency Board system which operates every Saturday, the day on which we normally have elections. The system required for elections would be no more complex than that one. The TAB system is able to supply results of a race that night. It is interesting to note, in terms of our national priorities, that we can run a gambling organisation of a most massive and comprehensive kind , yet we cannot do the same thing in respect of elections. Every possible type of pseudo objection has been put up.

        —No; I am saying that the TAB is a gambling organisation which has a facility which the Government does not have. I come to the last point, a point which I think is constantly missed in this debate: The reason for computerisation is not the speed at which results can be produced. I think if somebody in this House actually paid some attention to the way in which we count the Senate ballot he would immediately be impressed by the possibilities of a computerised system. The counting of the ballot for the Senate is probably one of the most archaic methods still existing in any democratic country, yet the system itself is one of the most advanced. In other words, we have in operation for the Senate an incredibly advanced voting system which can very accurately predict the percentage support within the country at large. Yet the counting method is extremely primitive. It is done by taking large guesstimates on tables and phoning in from around the country to try to see which pile of ballot papers shall be taken off next. I suggest that the Australian Electoral Office needs to look carefully at and get on its files before next year all information relevant to this topic so that in its report next year we may actually have some suggestions from it which have more substance than the reply that the Minister gave in the other place.

        —Once again, the annual report of the Australian Electoral Office is instructive, principally because of the deficiencies it reveals in the electoral policies of the Fraser Government. In that respect, I do not put any blame on the Electoral Office itself because it is a very highly efficient and professional organisation which operates very successfully within the confines of what this Government allows, both financially and politically. Two points need to be brought out in respect of the Electoral Office and the way in which this Government has shackled its work.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       After the 1977 elections, the Government, through the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr McLeay, called for a report to be prepared on the electoral legislation. After a considerable delay-it took 18 months to prepare it-a report running to 181 pages and looking at all the aspects and deficiencies of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the effects that flow from them was prepared. It was and still is a very thorough and useful contribution to what needs to be done in respect of voting in Federal elections. It was made available to the Minister and the Government but not to the Parliament. I probed and asked questions on numerous occasions of Ministers in this place, one of whom actually held in the Senate the portfolio of Administrative Services, but the report was not made public for reasons best known to the Government. It has not been presented to the Parliament nor did the Government take any action to implement any of the recommendations in the report. As honourable senators know the Senate has been stymied in looking at the report because of the intransigent and obstructive position taken by the Government in refusing to allow a Senate select committee to look at the report or the Electoral Act itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman)-we have had three ministerial changes in this area-obviously decided that the report was too hot to handle and set about getting around the problem by commissioning a further review of the Electoral Act. Despite a great deal of prodding on my behalf, the whereabouts of that review is still not known. In a letter to me, Mr Newman said the review was nearing completion. That was in April 1981, 18 months ago. He said that the second report was nearing completion. Of course, a third report on the Commonwealth Electoral Act was prepared by Mr Harders which dealt with another aspect of elections. It too has been pigeonholed. Three reports have dealt with aspects of the Electoral Act which have been kept from the Parliament and the Australian people. As a result, the valuable reviews that have been carried out by the Department and by the special committee under Mr Harders are still not public documents and have still not been considered by this Government . The Government stands indicted for that when we know, on the basis of those reports, that there are considerable deficiencies in the way in which the Electoral Act is operating.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second point that I wish to make regarding aspects that were raised in one of the reports which came into my hands is the Department's considerable concern about the enormous informal vote still rife in our Federal electoral system. This is a particularly severe problem for the Senate because in excess of 10 per cent of voters have their votes ruled invalid as a result of the complexities of the voting system and the deficiencies in the way in which the Electoral Act is being administered. Ten per cent of those people who vote in Australia are being disenfranchised by the nature of the voting system which causes their votes to be set aside because they have not gone to the extraordinary length of filling in to the last detail 50 or 60 numbers against the names of the candidates standing for an election. That only shows how correct it was that the Australian Labor Party, under the Daly legislation, sought to rectify it. That gave rise to another of the obstructions placed in the way of the Labor Party's endeavours in 1972-75 to bring about a more fair and equitable system which removed the sorts of difficulties to which I am referring.
      </para>
      <para>
       The stringent requirement of our voting system in this regard makes Australia a laughing stock. Nowhere else in the world does this situation exist. Nowhere else does an absurd rule operate. Nowhere else could an informal voting rate of 10 per cent or more be allowed by any government, any Minister or any chamber worth its salt. The efforts that I have made in this chamber to look at this problem have been nullified by the obstructionist position taken by every Government member on the other side of the House. Yet the solution is quite simple. It has already been introduced in State politics in New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia. Even in the Australian Capital Territory itself, a system operates which reduces the requirement of having to mark every square on the ballot paper and provides for a lesser more meaningful number. Such a reform in the Federal system would immediately cut the informal vote by at least two- thirds. Instead of 10 per cent of people losing the value of their vote, the figure would be reduced to no more than two or three per cent. That would be in accordance with normal voting patterns.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Electoral Office has for some time been carrying out another survey in respect of the informal voting. It has that report in its possession as an internal working document. The Minister has it. He has sat on it and has not been prepared to take any steps. Perhaps it is not the Minister's fault. Perhaps this Government has refused to act on it as it has refused to take any steps to rectify the current redistribution problem that faces Australia. More than 32 seats in Australia are now beyond the tolerance level of voters. We have an absurd situation in that some mainland electorates in Australia have over 93,000 voters and others have over 60,000 voters. In Tasmania, because of the constitutional requirements, the numbers are about 50,000. If there is no election until the end of next year, mainland seats could conceivably have twice the number of voters of those in Tasmania.
      </para>
      <para>
       These matters have been brought to the attention of the Government and it has refused to take any steps at all. It is recreant. It is a failure on the part of the Minister that he has done nothing about these matters or, if he has done something, it is a failure on the part of the Government. It is another example of the failure of the Government to move when it knows what needs to be done. Of course, a further example of where it has failed to act is the wholesale tax evasion which was in the Government's knowledge when it came to office in 1975. Cabinet members were not able to be persuaded to act because of their conservative bias and the protection of their friends in the tax area. In the same way, the Government has not been prepared to take the necessary steps to reform the Electoral Act and to act on the grave deficiencies that exist in it. One can conclude only that it is purely a party political decision on the part of the Minister, the Government or the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that these sorts of things should still exist despite the fact that they have had in their possession since 1977 reports the adoption of whose recommendations would overcome and obviate the deficiencies to which I have referred.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why does the Government do this? It gives the Government a decided advantage if ethnic people and people with low educational standards cannot comprehend the system. Migrants come to Australia from countries whose voting systems are entirely different. They may have proportional voting, first past the post or optional voting systems. The States have optional systems. In the States voting has to finish by 6 o'clock. Commonwealth elections are still being conducted from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., but in a number of states they are conducted from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The different voting systems and legislation of many of the States create difficulties for the electorate at large. That is understandable. Yet this Government sits on the reports and fails to take any action at all. However , it is prepared to allow to operate in the Australian Capital Territory such optional preferential systems which make allowance for a person's inability to complete a ballot paper. As long as the clear intention of the voter is indicated the vote is regarded as valid.

       That the Senate take note of the paper.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senate has before it the annual report of Telecom Australia for the year ended June 1982, and I wish to draw attention to one or two of the key matters referred to therein. The first is mentioned on the first page of the Chairman's statement. He reports vastly improved results in the operations of Telecom since 1975, when that organisation was established, and makes the following point:
      </para>
      <para>
       Telecom is sometimes criticised on the grounds that its profits are too high. Those who suggest that Telecom should operate at a lower level of return, fail to appreciate that the consequent reduced cash flow would mean a reduction in funds available for expenditure on the expansion and maintenance of the network and would make Telecom's task of improving the standard of customer service more difficult than it now is.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have read that passage because it draws attention to a very important aspect which is frequently misrepresented by the Press in commenting on Telecom's profits. On 14 and 15 October a number of articles in the Press drew attention to Telecom's high profit of some $275m. Profits of that order made by private corporations are sometimes hailed as providing an example of success, whereas they are not in relation to Telecom because it is a public corporation providing public services. For the record, I make the point that the profit of $275m, given Telecom's capital investment, represents a profit of 9.2 per cent before interest charges are allowed for and 3.2 per cent after interest charges are allowed for. It is very important to realise the size of the investment in respect of which that profit is earned. I repeat, the position is frequently misrepresented. It is suggested that Telecom should not make such profits because it is providing a public service.
      </para>
      <para>
       What should be realised, as the Chairman points out, is that Telecom must finance urgently needed new services from profits. Thus, in 1981-82 internal funds, or profits, provided 74 per cent of the total capital investment needed by Telecom in order to extend its telephone network. That network has been massively extended since 1975 when Telecom was established. I repeat, 74 per cent of the funds needed for capital investment were internally generated from profits. Those funds are spent on expanding the network and carrying out other necessary works to improve Australia's telecommunications service.
      </para>
      <para>
       Telecom is required to generate internally 50 per cent of its working capital, and the figure of 74 per cent is much higher than is achieved by any other telecommunications authority in the world and certainly much higher than that of any normal business enterprise. I draw attention to some comparative figures. For instance, Bell Canada finances 53 per cent of its expansion from internal revenue. For the National Telecommunicatons Company of Japan the figure is 68 per cent; for the Bell Company of the United States it is 67 per cent; and for Deutsches Bundespost the figure is 44 per cent. For Telecom this year, according to the business outlays document of Telecom, the figure is close to 85 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       If one examines the comparative proportions of internal financing in private business, or other large statutory undertakings, one notes the following examples: Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd finances 56 per cent of its capital works internally. For the State Electricity Commission of Victoria the figure is 21 per cent; and for a company such as CSR Ltd the figure is 67 per cent. Thus, an enormous corporation such as Telecom is required to finance a much higher proportion of its capital works than is expected of other instrumentalities in other countries and of other businesses in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The point of all of this is simply to comment on Telecom's integrity and efficiency in financing its business operations. The Chairman, in the report, makes the point that between 1975 and 1982 the rate of annual business growth ranged from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. Last year it was 12 per cent. More than 80 per cent of homes in Australia now have telephones, compared with 62 per cent in 1975. The lesson in all of this is that Telecom is a highly productive organisation with increases in its productivity, increased business growth and increases in the proportion of capital that is generated internally to expand the telephone network; that at this time it can be seen, by Australian standards , to be a most successful enterprise. That does not mean that it does not have faults in regard to the delivery of services. There is always room for improvement in efficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       At present this Parliament is awaiting the report of the Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia-the Davidson, Committee-which was set up by the Government at the time of the disastrous razor gang exercise of April 1981. Its purpose is to ascertain which sections of Telecom might be made available to private enterprise. The consequences of any such action would be to damage severely the business structure that I have just described. It would be damaging in terms of competition, which would result in poorer services, particularly for people in Australia's rural communities. Telecom has not been allowed by this Government to function as well as it might. It has not been allowed to borrow additional finance for capital works, as recommended by the McKinsey and Co. Inc. inquiry which was set up by the Government. The report of that inquiry suggested that Telecom's borrowing capacity should be expanded. That has not been permitted. Telecom is not being permitted to develop new services such as videotex, which would have provided a service throughout Australia in rural communities especially. Permission to proceed was denied on ideological grounds. As a result, because no other organisation can provide it as efficiently, cheaply and well, this new technology will not proceed in Australia for a number of years. These sorts of hobbles which have been placed on Telecom as a result of ministerial stupidity have not debilitated the organisation to the extent that it cannot produce a very favourable report, such as the annual report for 1981-82, which I commend to the Senate.

       The report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is more or less on time this year. The ABC has been the subject of criticism in the past for not presenting its annual report to the Parliament at the right time. This is a significant report. It is the fiftieth report of the ABC. Honourable senators will recall that earlier this year the ABC celebrated its 50th anniversary with a very high standard of programs. It is the fiftieth report of the ABC; it is also the last. I think it is important to note that too. If the legislation which has been through the House of Representatives and has come to the Senate- it will be supported by the Opposition except for some disastrous provisions-is passed the ABC, as it has been traditionally known, will no longer exist. It will be replaced by a new national broadcasting service which, of course, will represent a continuance of the role which the ABC has played.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wanted to highlight one or two important aspects of this report. The ABC, in referring to the new legislation before the Parliament and in referring to the Australian Broadcasting Commission Committee of Review-the Dix Committee-which inquired into the organisation, notes that its role has now been clarified. That is to say, the ABC is now enjoined to 'provide a balance between programs of wide appeal and specialised programs'. In practice this will mean both. I hope that this will mean an end to the silly sort of arguments which debilitated the ABC for years about what its proper function was-whether it was a majority broadcaster or a complementary special broadcaster looking after the interests only of minority groups. I would argue and I have argued for some time-I think the Government has acceded to this argument-that it has to be both. It will have a very good effect on commercial and other broadcasters if it can do so-called mass entertainment programming as well as other programming and give those broadcasters good and quality competition. I think that is very important.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was in this spirit of achieving a vigorous approach to the ABC that the Opposition made its widely publicised response to the Dix Committee report. One of the points which was argued very much in that response was that this question of a charter for the ABC should be resolved. One of the things we also hoped for in that comment on the Dix report was that the ABC would have adequate funding for Australian productions from now on. Traditionally, the ABC has been a pace setter in terms of quality programming in this country, particularly in quality drama and current affairs programs. It would be nice to see the ABC in this new period resuming the role which it carried out over such a long period.
      </para>
      <para>
       Unfortunately, of course, the Government is still doing curious things in relation to the ABC. The Commission itself draws attention to its being left off the board of Aussat Pty Ltd, the satellite company, when every other major user of the satellite is represented on the board of that company. Only the ABC, of the major or potential users is left off. It is nice to see that even the commissioners, with that touch of humour which sometimes flashes into ABC programming, noted, surely with tongue in cheek, that although the ABC has been left off the board of Aussat Pty Ltd, the satellite company, a man called Denis Horgan, who happens to be a director of the satellite company, has been appointed recently as a commissioner of the ABC. One can only assume that the comment was made by the Australian Broadcasting Commission with, as I said, tongue in cheek.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report displays the continued mean-spirited approach of this Government towards important issues confronting the ABC. One example, as I have said, is that it has been left off the board of the satellite company. The Opposition hopes that the Government will change its attitude to some of these questions in light of the new legislation relating to the ABC. The Government will have the opportunity when it considers the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report on radiated subscription television to consider the case for an ABC RSTV network throughout Australia. At page 7 of the report the Commissioner states that the ABC is willing, in principle, to operate such a service. As we all know the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, for reasons not fully justified, said that the ownership and operation of subscription television should be exclusively the province of the private sector. The ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service are , in the view of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, to be excluded. That report of the Tribunal has some horrendous philosophical defects in it and some appallingly bad economics. It is unfortunate but I guess that most of its decisions will not be taken too seriously in the light of those facts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Ministers in this Government, of course, talk consistently of the need to get more funds into national or non-commercial broadcasting. Here they have a golden opportunity to raise such money by subscription television. Surely the ABC needs it more than the commercial sector. If the ABC had a subscription television service that would be a substantial contributor, in our estimate, to the funds of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to the improvement of national broadcasting in this country. It would mean also, of course, that giving it to the ABC would be fairer as between commercial operators. I draw attention to the fact that at page 57 of the report it is recorded that ABC television achieved a 55 per cent or more Australian content in its programming last year. This is a very important achievement and we must not lose sight of it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I note again that the recommendations of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on subscription television and cable television in relation to Australian content are tantamount to culling it right down in order to make such services viable in Australia. The message from that is that existing commercial broadcasters and the ABC presumably will be required to maintain Australian content but that providers of cable television will not be. Most of the programs presumably will come from the United States, or overseas. In this country we have spent years building up what Mr Gyngell, as chairman of the Broadcasting Tribunal, called the 'Australian look'. If it is all to be prejudiced by the introduction of new technologies in haste that would be disastrous in the Opposition's view for this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report refers to other notable achievements of the ABC, including a valuable contribution to Aboriginal broadcasting. We look ahead to a great development for the national broadcasting service. The necessity for a second regional radio network is a matter of prime concern. We hope that the Government will think again on such issues as the appointment of commissioners of the ABC and some of the other undesirable features of the proposed legislation.

       This report by the Australian Science and Technology Council is prepared by the Technological Change Committee of that body. It is the first report on the impact of robots in Australia and as such is significant. It goes through the benefits that industry generally can expect to receive from the introduction of robots. Generally it encourages their introduction without any problems or discouragement. The report lists amongst the advantages of robots increased productivity, reduced labour costs, increased product quality and improved safety and working conditions. It also states that there is a great need for good communication among the trade union movement, the Government and industry so that everybody is quite clear what impact robotics will have on Australian industry and the Australian economy. While I could not agree more with that aspect of the report, it is vital that consultation take place.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report makes a number of recommendations which appear to me to be quite reasonable. Nevertheless, there is one aspect of the report with which I must take great issue. It tries to make an estimate of the number of jobs that robots will replace. It states that in the next decade it expects the introduction of 1 ,200 to 1,600 robots into Australian industry. It goes on to state that each robot will replace 1.5 jobs and on that basis in the next decade it expects only about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs to be significantly affected by the introduction of robots. That is an estimate with which I cannot agree. I believe that the Committee of ASTEC has very seriously underestimated the number of robots that will be introduced into this country and the effect that their introduction will have on the job market. In Japan and in the United States factories are being set up right now composed entirely of robots. Some years ago I attended an international convention which was attended by leading businessmen and manufacturers from around the world. The only thing they wanted to talk about was robots. It was the thing exciting their imaginations. They were saying that we could get robots to work 24 hours a day without any overtime and that they did not go on strike.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Senator Primmer raised a very important point. Robots are a basic new development and they will dramatically affect the job market. What are we going to do about them? I do not believe there is any way that we can inhibit their introduction. There is no way that we can stop the flow of technology, particularly in this area where, as the Committee has pointed out, there are so many advantages. Robots offer the opportunity to replace uninteresting jobs in often very difficult, noisy and unattractive environments. We cannot stop their introduction but we can face up to their impact and plan accordingly. There is no doubt that in the next decade there will be a vital need for retraining. Clearly, we have to get some basic objectives ahead of the nation and particularly ahead of our manufacturing industries so that we can direct our efforts and our resources in line with objectives that are generally agreed to by all sectors of the community and which could reasonably be expected to be pursued with vigor by employees, employers and the Government alike. This is possible. It is not easy, but it is possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suggest a long term indicative plan is absolutely essential if we are to avoid a catastrophic labour situation in Australia. I believe the report is significant. It is the first report that has faced up to the technological revolution. However, a lot more work needs to be done on the impact on the job market and on our labour relations generally. I conclude by stressing that the only way this impact can be minimised and serious social disruption avoided is by consultation, which the report makes clear, with sectors of the community so that the estimates of the future effect of technology are accurately forecast. At this point I believe they have not been accurately forecast.

       That the Senate take note of the paper.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is with pleasure that I speak on this statement. I am particularly pleased that Senator Townley is in the chair because Senator Townley, Senator Rae, Senator Grimes and I were the four senators designated by this chamber to consider, among other things, a replacement service for the Empress of Australia which fulfils an extremely important role in plying across Bass Strait between Webb Dock in Melbourne and Devonport, carrying some 112,000 passengers a year. The Senate Select Committee on Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania concluded that the figure was quite considerably below the demand which could be generated by an efficiently run, well promoted service. The Committee came to the conclusion that some 140,000 passengers could be carried across Bass Strait in a passenger-cargo ferry service, either by means of one vessel or two. The purport of the statement is to aquaint the Parliament with the fact that some five organisations have indicated an interest in providing that replacement service. They are the Australian National Line, Brambles Industries Ltd, Celsiunator Industries Pty Ltd, Tasmanian Shipping Services and TNT Bulkships Ltd.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is extremely important that some points made in that statement be commented on, always in the light of the Senate Committee's report. For example, it should always be kept in mind by the Government that the Senate Committee set out very clearly those principles which it thought, after taking much evidence, ought to be the guiding principles for a replacement service. They were: That passengers and freight should be combined in the service; that the main service should operate between Melbourne and Devonport; that the service should operate overnight; that the service should contain a mixed configuration of berths and sleeper lounge chairs; that the service should provide accommodation for at least 650 passengers in one or more ships; and that the ANL should negotiate with the maritime unions with a view to reducing manning levels.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should like to elaborate on at least two of those matters. Firstly, in relation to the statement by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) that some of the proposals, but not all, envisaged an overnight service, it must be said that the Senate Committee concluded very firmly that a daylight crossing of Bass Strait was not in the best interests of those passengers who would have to stay awake during the transit of what can be a somewhat turbulent stretch of water. The second matter relates to costs involved in the embarkation or disembarkation of passengers, cargo and vehicles at penalty rates outside normal daylight working hours. Of course, it is a fact that most tourists would prefer to travel across Bass Strait at night time so they could enjoy daylight hours for travelling on land.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to the statement by the Minister that all the proposals were for a combined passenger-cargo vessel and included services capable of operating on a commercially viable basis without direct government subsidy, it must be said that this also was the view of the Committee. It was known that, in any case, the ANL would have to replace its freight vessels operating into north-west Tasmania in the mid-1980s and that therefore it was sensible to attempt to combine those two functions of carrying cargo and passengers across Bass Strait in a vessel or vessels which were so constructed and which provided extra capacity for both cargo and passengers in a way which would not require Commonwealth Government subsidy. I think that that was an important point of agreement between the Senate Committee and most of the proposals put forward. But what is of concern is the fact that the Minister says that terminal ports in the proposals vary between Melbourne-Devonport, Melbourne-Burnie, Melbourne-Bell Bay, Westernport-Bell Bay, or some combination of these terminal ports. He further says:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . that the Commonwealth Government's prime concern is that as far as possible the Empress of Australia be replaced with a service or services based on a sound commercial decision rather than government selection.
      </para>
      <para>
       I put it to the Senate that the Government cannot escape making a decision which is essential to the viability of the four-port system in Tasmania, particularly to the viability of the port of Devonport; namely, that the Senate Committee's recommendations on the routes and ports that ought to be employed in a replacement service ought to be adopted by the Government as the criteria within which the proposals should be assessed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senate Committee, in Chapter 14 of its report, said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Devonport has been the main Tasmanian sea passenger terminal since the introduction of the Princess of Tasmania in 1959. The city has therefore been geared for a long time to the needs of people using the sea service. The Marine Board of Devonport warned that:
      </para>
      <para>
       'If the revenue from the sea passenger service is removed from the Port of Devonport, its financial structure, which has been developed for the last 20 years around this type of interstate passenger and cargo service, will become unviable.
      </para>
      <para>
       The loss of revenue of some $500,000 would mean a deficit operation for the port unless some other unexpected trade arose.'
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee concluded that the present arrangements, being satisfactory, ought to be continued.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to the possibility that a second vessel might be brought on to the run, the Committee thought that Burnie had many desirable features, once again being a north-west coast port and therefore within two hours shorter steaming time from Melbourne than Bell Bay on the Tamar. Also, of course, it would allow passengers to disembark in the centre of a small north-west community rather than 50 kilometres from the main city, as would be the case with the Bell Bay- Launceston link.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is very important, therefore, that the Government makes a clear and unequivocal commitment to the retention of Devonport as the sole or primary port for the replacement vessel or vessels, as the case may be, with Burnie being designated the second port for the service should a two-vessel replacement strategy be adopted. That commitment should be made known to the five prospective operators and their submissions and tenders for the service should be tailored accordingly. That is the way that the Committee of the Senate saw the matter. That is the way that the north-west and west coast communities see the matter. I strongly urge the Government to see the matter in the same light.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, may I say that while it is gratifying to see that the Minister considers that discussions and consultations ought to take place with the two State governments concerned-that is, Victoria and Tasmania-and with the proponents of the replacement service, he neglects to mention the most important matter in the view of the Committee; namely, that the unions be consulted at the earliest possible opportunity so that disputes over manning levels do not impede the provision of a service which is perhaps more efficient in relation to manning levels but which also respects the legitimate employment aspirations of those involved in the maritime unions. Members of the Committee I am sure will recall hearings that we held in Melbourne, at which Mr Roger Wilson, the Acting Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Seamen's Union of Australia and Mr Kenneth MacLeod, the Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymans Association of Australia, both indicated on behalf of their members their concern that these negotiations and consultations should embrace the unions at the earliest possible opportunity. That is the way to an industrially harmonious and effective agreement which will enable the replacement service to provide that fillip to Tasmania's tourist trade and, indeed, to the normal social intercourse of Tasmanians with the mainland which is so desired.

       This report is, according to a letter addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) by the Director of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory, Mr R. W. Gee, a report describing the management of emergent exotic diseases in Australia and the role of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory in dealing with them. The report is, in effect, a special plea by ANAHL for the opportunity to introduce into Australia a virus associated with certain exotic diseases. Of course the proposal which is exciting an amount of public attention at the moment is a proposal to introduce into Australia, for the ANAHL the foot and mouth disease virus. A great deal of concern has been expressed by a large number of primary producers in Australia about the possibility of this virus being introduced. Of course everyone is aware that, if there were ever an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Australia, it would wipe out our beef export industry. That would have disasterous consequences for much of Australia but particularly for the northern half of Australia where the major part of our beef export industry is located. Without a doubt we would lose access overnight to nearly all of our overseas market. Therefore, it is understandable that the beef producers have indicated great concern at the possibility of the virus of foot and mouth disease being present in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       This debate is one that will be pursued by scientists and by producers as well as by others. It should be noted that not all scientists are of the view of those who wrote this report. The report gives enthusiastic support to the importation of the virus by ANAHL and there is close argument through the report on why it is necessary to introduce the virus and why there is no risk, according to ANAHL in the introduction of the virus. However, as I have said, it is a special pleading. A number of scientists are of different opinions on the importance of the importation of the virus and the risks of importation. So the view expressed in this report is by no means the unanimous view of experts on the subject. It is clear from the letter to which I have referred, to the Minister from Mr Gee, that there was a request for this report to be written. It has been very valuable to have ANAHL write a report to the Minister and publically state its view on the issue. However, I would not like the report to be seen as having the status of the final expert document on the subject and the only recommendation that could be made to the Government on it. We have to treat it as only one point of view and we have to realise that it is written by those who have sought from the Government the opportunity to import the virus for experimentation, research and training.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would not seek to denigrate the scientists who hold the point of view expressed in this report. I just have to say, as someone who is certainly not a scientist, that I am a little wary of scientists being advisers as well as being arbiters on a matter of such public moment as this. There has been considerable controversy in the last few days about radioactive mineral sands tailings in northern New South Wales and Queensland. I am aware that a couple of years ago it was thought to be a very good idea for keen gardeners to buy mineral sands tailings to topdress their lawns. I was told with full confidence by someone who was advising me on the top dressing of my lawn that this was the product to have . As it happened, thank goodness, I did not follow that advice because whilst I was assured at the time-I certainly did not ask whether it was radioactive; it did not cross my mind-that there was no problem in using this product, it was just good for lawn, the views that were held by scientists a few years ago on the safety of this product are now very close to being discredited.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not think the scientists should be discredited, but I think we should conclude from that experience that science is not always an exact science and that, when scientists give advice on whether something is safe, they give it in the light of the best knowledge that they have available to them. That knowledge may grow and expand as a result of either further research or the consequences of decisions that are taken and which can be shown to have been the result of wrong advice. We have to accept that scientists can make mistakes, that they are not infallible, and we should not flagellate them verbally or otherwise because they have made a mistake in the past in regard to advice they have given. However, scientists should also admit the fallibility of the science that they are pursuing. If they wish to seek the right to be kindly viewed as fallible when a mistake is discovered, they must also admit fallibility when they are giving advice.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not pick up in this report a suggestion that this is the best advice available on the evidence available; it is possible that there are risks. I have had put to me a view that there are risks involved in the importation of the live foot and mouth disease virus. I am aware that that view is held by eminent and respectable scientists, just as eminent and respectable scientists hold the contrary point of view. My hope is that this matter is some distance from resolution and that great caution will be exercised in proceeding with the debate before making a decision.

        —The importation of foot and mouth virus worried me when I first heard about it. As a scientist-one of the few scientists in this Parliament-I think I should briefly say a few things about it. Following the worry that I originally had about this matter, I sought quite specialised advice from people who unfortunately have to remain nameless at this stage. They told me they would give me information provided I did not mention their names. I asssure the Senate that they hold quite eminent positions in this country. They pointed out to me that foot and mouth disease concerns not just one virus; in fact, upwards of 60 different viruses are classified as foot and mouth disease, and many other diseases in cattle may be just as dangerous. Of course the report of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory does point to some of those.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The information that I was given was that Australia has been extremely fortunate in not having had foot and mouth disease imported already. I believe there was one outbreak, many years ago. The person I talked to, who was very knowledgeable in this matter, said it was quite remarkable that, for one reason or another, one of the viruses had not come into this country and we have not had to adopt a process of slaughtering animals or isolating them, or of undertaking a vaccination program.

        —I do not think that it is necessarily a tribute to the quarantine service. I think it has been lucky. The country has been lucky. Whereas I was originally opposed to the importation of these viruses, I now am not. I have yet to visit the laboratory in Geelong but I have asked to accompany the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources when it goes there. I have been informed that it is of world class, if not the best in the world. It has a means of making sure that the viruses do not escape. Although there can always be human error, I think the risk of human error at a place like the laboratory in Geelong would be much less than the risk Australia presently faces from importation by accident, in spite of the groups that try to keep these viruses out of the country. The risk is higher from that point of view than it is from loss or leakage of the virus from the laboratory. Of course, one can always say in a situation such as this that the risk is increased by having the virus in the country. If that risk is very small, I think it is something with which we can live. Whilst we will have some argument among the different scientists, I believe that argument has to be taken with due regard to the reason people do not want the virus to come in. I believe that for some reasons some people have a vested interest in not having the virus here. I hope that when the Senate committee deals with this matter it will keep that kind of thing in mind. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       That the Senate take note of the paper.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report of the Human Rights Commission on the Australian Citizenship Act unfortunately has been in the hands of honourable senators for less than an hour . I have not been able to review it as comprehensively as I would like. Nevertheless, the report represents an important fulfilment of one of the functions of the Human Rights Commission as set out in its enabling Act; namely, that it examine enactments for the purpose of ascertaining whether the enactments are inconsistent with or contrary to any human rights and to report to the Minister concerned the results of any such examination. I still have not had given to me any accompanying statement by the Minister concerned in relation to this report. However, the report is an indication of the type of work which will be undertaken by the Human Rights Commission, given the fact that it was not invested with many of the important powers which many honourable senators in this chamber thought it ought to be invested with to give it real teeth.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the review of the Citizenship Act-taking as the basis for the review the understanding that citizenship is one of the fundamental elements in the life of a nation and the Citizenship Act itself has an important bearing on everyone's civil and political rights-the Commission examined five or six aspects of that Act. In the short time that is available to me I wish to look at the section which deals with the oath of allegiance. What is required as part of the ceremony when a person takes out Australian citizenship is the renunciation of all other allegiance. To my mind the Human Rights Commission does not see the point that that part of the ceremony has a very severe impact on persons who are of dual nationality within our country. What the Commission said in relation to that renunciation is quite correct; namely, that it is totally ineffectual and only symbolic to renounce one's allegiance to the former homeland, the home of one's first nationality. It is ineffectual because if that homeland does not recognise in its legal system that act of renunciation in Australia the new Australian citizen carries with him the nationality of his or her former homeland. At paragraph 30 of the report the Commission states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Many countries from which Australia derives its immigrants allow their citizens to accept the citizenship of a second country without depriving them of the citizenship of the first country, e.g. British, Greek and Lebanese citizens do not lose that citizenship when taking out Australian citizenship. In those cases , the first citizenship would normally only be lost by a formal act of renunciation. Simply taking an oath which includes renunciation of former allegiance would not amount to such a formal act. Therefore, the renunciation clause itself has no legal effect in the first country.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no perception whatsoever in that statement of the fact that if the renunciation is not regarded as effective in the former homeland the new Australian citizen loses the right to the protection of the Australian Government when he or she returns to that former homeland. Therefore, a very serious situation exists in which citizens of Australia travelling abroad who pass through or wish to visit their former homeland are put in a very severe predicament whereby they can be subjected to the laws of that former homeland and have no protection from the Australian consular offices. I have pointed this out during several debates in this chamber. On 29 March 1979 I moved a motion in the following terms:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Senate notes with concern the lack of action by the Australian Government to relieve Australian citizens of the disadvantages of dual nationality, particularly as experienced in visiting former homelands, and urges the Government speedily to implement the recommendations contained in the Report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Dual Nationality, tabled in the Senate on 14 October 1976.
      </para>
      <para>
       An article in the Age of 2 August stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       A month ago an Australian man who had emigrated from Italy at the age of nine revisited the land of his birth. He was detained there and told he was liable for military service; only after some diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing was he spared conscription.
      </para>
      <para>
       One recalls that several years ago-I think it was about 1975-the Yugoslav Government refused to allow Australian diplomats access to Australian citizens held in detention for several months. The Yugoslav Government even executed Australian citizens who held Yugoslav nationality. It did so without informing the Australian Government. That is extremely disturbing. This matter was not addressed by the Human Rights Commission in its report. The matter is of grave concern to the various ethnic communities. In fact, one of their leaders, Professor Athanasius Laouvaris, who edits the monthly ethnic affairs journal The New Austral Times-I commend it to honourable senators-said recently that the Federal Government was deliberately pushing the whole issue of dual nationality under the carpet. Professor Louvaris is a most distinguished scholar. He is a very energetic member of the Australian community. Through various publications he attempts to put the point of view of the ethnic communities in relation to this matter, as does Mr Alan Taskunas, who is a senior administrator at the University of Tasmania. Mr Taskunas pointed out in a recent article in The New Austral Times the situation which prevails; it is as I have described it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact is that the Government seems to be taking the attitude that nothing can be done. Yet the fact is that those are models available to us, whether within the European Economic Community or among the Warsaw Pact countries, of arrangements, agreements and formal treaties between governments which require that the government of the former homeland renounce claims that a person is a national of that former homeland should he move to another country and establish residence there. Even more so should that be the case when a person obtains citizenship in a country of settlement and renounces his former allegiance and nationality. That ought to be regarded as effective in international law. It is something to which I hope this Goverment will give attention. As I say, I am disappointed that the Human Rights Commission did not advert to this extremely important aspect of the ineffectual nature of the renunciation clause in the oath of allegiance. I hope the matter will be taken up and acted upon in accordance with the wishes of those in many ethnic communities in our country.

       This Bill will amend the income tax law in a number of respects, primarily to give effect to a number of the Government's Budget proposals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Included in the Bill are the measures necessary to allow a rebate of tax on up to $1000 of certain dividends, to increase the sole parent rebate and the rebate for a spouse, daughter-housekeeper or housekeeper where there is a dependent child or student and to introduce a rebate of tax for those in receipt of taxable Australian social security and repatriation pensions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bill will also reflect the announced reduction in the standard rate of personal tax from 32 per cent to 30 per cent from 1 November 1982 by making consequential adjustments such as to the rate used to calculate various rebates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other Budget measures given effect by the Bill include a new rebate of tax for home buyers for the top slice of their interest payments on home loans of up to $60,000, together with a further easing of the dividend distribution requirements for private companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       It also contains provisions to exempt from tax the rehabilitation allowance payable from 1 March 1983 to persons under treatment or training with the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and to authorise income tax deductions for gifts of $2 or more made to certain public funds and organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The calculation of provisional tax for the 1982-83 year of income is also provided for.

       Dependant Rebates
      </para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       As announced in the Budget Speech, the rebate for a dependent spouse and the rebate available for a daughter-housekeeper or a housekeeper are to be increased by $200-from $830 to $1030-where there are dependent (including student) children.
      </para>
      <para>
       The increased rebate will be available to a taxpayer who would have been entitled to a dependant rebate in respect of a child under 16 years of age or a student less than 25 years of age but for the replacement of such rebates by family allowances.
      </para>
      <para>
       The sole parent rebate will also be increased by $200 from $580 to $780.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because the increased rebates are to apply from 1 November 1982, the increases for the 1982-83 income year will be $133-representing two-thirds of the full year increase of $200.
      </para>
      <para>
       As zone rebates are partly based on dependant rebates, entitlement to an increased dependant rebate will mean a higher zone rebate.
      </para>
      <para>
       These measures will provide additional help to single income families with dependant children-particularly when combined with other personal income tax reductions which I will mention shortly.

       Rebate for Pensioners

      </para>
      <para>
       Another budget decision to be implemented by this Bill is the introduction of a special pensioner rebate for income tax purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rebate, together with the increase in the tax-free threshold to $4,595 to be effected by the Income Tax (Rates) Bill 1982 that will be introduced shortly, will ensure that persons wholly or mainly dependent on a taxable social security or repatriation pension do not bear tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       More specifically, the maximum rebate of $167 for 1982-83 (reflecting a 1 November 1982 commencement date for this concession) and $250 in subsequent years will mean that no tax will be payable on taxable incomes of up to $5,007 for 1982-83 and up to $5,429 in subsequent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rebate will shade out above these income levels, but the shading arrangements will result in some rebate being available where taxable income exceeds the above levels but is less than $6,343 in 1982-83 and $7,429 in subsequent years.

       Honourable senators will recall that on 18 March 1982 the Treasurer made a statement in another place following a detailed review by the Government of housing policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       In that statement he made it clear that the Government is committed to preserving the highest practicable level of private home ownership in Australia and announced a tax rebate for home loan interest to alleviate the burden of housing mortgage payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rebate is available from 1 July 1982 to individuals in the first five years of owner-occupancy of a sole or principal residence in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       As further evidence of the Government's concern the Treasurer announced in the Budget Speech an alternative rebate of tax for interest payments made on or after 1 July 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       The existing rebate will continue to be available and can be used by eligible taxpayers where it offers a larger rebate than the new scheme does in a particular year of income.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new rebate, which is authorised by this Bill, is to be available to an individual taxpayer resident in Australia in respect of interest paid in a year of income that is attributable to such part of the interest rate as exceeds 10 per cent per annum, calculated on a reducing balance basis. In respect of the first $60,000 of a loan or loans on a dwelling.
      </para>
      <para>
       Unlike the existing rebate scheme the new rebate will not be restricted to the first years of home ownership or by specified upper limits of rebate.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rebate will be at the standard rate of tax and will not exceed the tax otherwise payable on assessment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rebate is to be allowed on interest paid to the extent to which the interest exceeds 10 per cent per annum of the average balance of a home loan in a year of income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Adjustments may be made to the amount calculated as the averaage loan balance to account for unusual or additional repayments during a year or for increases in the balance of the loan at a particular time in the year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposal to limit the rebate to the first $60,000 of a loan or loans on a dwelling will result in the amount otherwise subject to rebate in a year of income being reduced proportionately if the balance of the moneys owing on the home exceed $60,000 at the end of the year of income.
      </para>
      <para>
       Interest will be within the scheme if it is paid on moneys lent to a taxpayer and applied for certain specified purposes connected with a dwelling used by the taxpayer as his or her sole or principal residence.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those purposes include the acquisition of land on which a dwelling is subsequently constructed, the construction of a dwelling or the acquisition of land on which there is already a dwelling.
      </para>
      <para>
       Interest on moneys used to extend a dwelling may also qualify.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where moneys are borrowed partly for the purpose of acquiring or constructing a dwelling and partly for other purposes, so much only of the interest as is attributable to the part of the moneys applied to acquire or construct the dwelling will qualify for the rebate. Moneys borrowed on the security of a dwelling will not qualify unless they are expended for a qualifying purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
       Interest payments that attract income tax deductions under ordinary rules will continue to be deductible and will not attract the rebate.
      </para>
      <para>
       A taxpayer who is entitled to a rebate under either the new scheme or the existing home loan interest rebate scheme will be able to elect to transfer that benefit to his or her spouse.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rebate is to be incorporated in the PAYE tax instalment deduction scheme as from 1 November 1982. Taxpayers taking advantage of the rebate by this method will be required to complete a declaration form and lodge it with their employers.

      </para>
      <para>
       The rebate will not apply to dividends paid by co-operative companies that are accorded special income tax treatment, dividends that are taxed at special higher rates of tax and certain amounts that are deemed to be dividends for limited income tax purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the earlier announcement, it has been decided that the rebate should be extended to dividends paid by the limited number of foreign companies that are listed on Australian stock exchanges.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Bill will give effect to these decisions.
      </para>

       This measure will further assist small businesses in maintaining adequate working capital and mean that this Government has increased the retention allowance from 50 per cent to 80 per cent since it came to office.
      </para>
      <para>
       Private companies will benefit from the increased retention allowance in respect of income of the 1981-82 and subsequent income years.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not proposed to vary the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or the rule that dividends received by one private company from another must be distributed in full if undistributed profits tax is to be avoided.

      <para>
       Details of each of the proposed extensions of this concession have been the subject of previous statements and I need mention them only briefly now.
      </para>
      <para>
       One extension will authorise deductions for gifts made during the 1981-82 and 1982-83 financial years to a public fund established and maintained exclusively for the relief of civilian victims of the conflict in Lebanon.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another will authorise deductions for gifts made after 17 August 1982 to the United Nations Association of Australia Decade of Trees Greening Australia and to a range of conservation organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Details of this particular proposal, including the names of the eligible organisations, were announced in a statement of 17 August 1982 by the Treasurer.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since that announcement the Government has decided that the concession should extend to a further conservation body-the National Parks Foundation of South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final amendment to the gift provisions proposed by the Bill will authorise deductions for gifts made after 26 August 1982 to the Centre for Independent Studies, the Playford Memorial Trust, the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Associations in Australia and Amnesty International in Australia.

       Rehabilitation Allowance
      </para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators will recall the announcement of Budget night that, from the first pension payday in March 1983, persons undergoing treatment or training with the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service who would otherwise be eligible for a social security pension or benefit will be eligible to receive a non-taxable rehabilitation allowance.
      </para>
      <para>
       The allowance will be equivalent to the invalid pension and subject to the same income test conditions of eligibility as the invalid pension.
      </para>
      <para>
       Legislation providing for the payment of the new allowance was introduced into the Parliament on 23 September 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the existing income tax law, the tax treatment of allowances received by persons undergoing treatment or training with the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service depends upon whether the pension or benefit to which the allowance relates is subject to tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Bill, by ensuring that the new rehabilitation allowance and associated training and living away from home allowances are exempt from tax, will introduce uniformity of tax treatment for all persons under treatment or training with the service.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bill also makes a number of consequential amendments so that no taxpayer will be disadvantaged as a result of a person, who would otherwise be eligible to receive an invalid pension, becoming instead eligible to receive a rehabilitation allowance.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendments will apply in relation to payments made on or after 1 March 1983 .
      </para>
      <para>
       Consequential Amendments
      </para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       As a consequence of the reduction in the standard rate of tax from 32 per cent to 30 per cent from 1 November 1982, the Bill provides for the adjustment of the rate at which various rebates are allowable, the rate of tax on certain lump sum payments and the rate of withholding tax on mining payments made to Aboriginal groups.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rebates in question are the general concessional rebate, the health insurance rebate and the existing home loan interest rebate.
      </para>
      <para>
       These rebates will be allowed at the rate of 30.67 per cent for 1982-83 and 30 per cent in subsequent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rate of tax on certain lump sum payments for accrued annual and/or long service leave made on retirement or termination of employment similarly will be limited to 30.67 per cent for 1982-83 and 30 per cent for subsequent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rate of withholding tax on mining payments made to Aboriginal groups on or after 1 November 1982 will be reduced from 6.4 per cent to 6 per cent- representing tax at the new standard rate of 30 per cent on one-fifth of the gross payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       Provisional Tax
      </para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       As provisional tax is part of the broad pay-as-you-earn system and is designed to collect tax on incomes consisting of or including non-salary or wage incomes within the year in which it was derived, it is generally accepted as reasonable that the amount charged should approximate as closely as practicable the amount of tax actually imposed for the year.
      </para>
      <para>
       This achieves a desirable measure of consistency with the treatment of salary or wage earners.
      </para>
      <para>
       Incomes for 1982-83 are expected to be higher than for 1981-82 and, of course, due to the changes to the personal income tax rate scale, effective rates of tax for 1982-83 will be lower than for last year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Accordingly, as in past years, it is proposed to vary the basis of calculating provisional tax for 1982-83 to be notified in assessment notices to issue this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bill thus provides for 1982-83 provisional tax to be calculated on the basis of 1981-82 taxable income as increased by 10 per cent and applying to the adjusted amount the lower rates of tax to apply for 1982-83.
      </para>
      <para>
       Generally, rebates allowed in 1981-82 will be taken into account in the calculation.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, where it appears from the information available in the taxpayer's 1981 -82 return of income that he or she will be entitled in 1982-83 to an increased spouse, daughter-housekeeper, housekeeper or sole parent rebate, the relevant rebates (including zone rebates where appropriate) allowable in 1981-82 will be increased accordingly.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new dividend and pensioner rebates will also be taken into account in the 1982-83 provisional tax calculation where it appears, from the information available in the taxpayer's 1981-82 return of income, that he or she will be entitled to one or both of these rebates.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is, of course, open to taxpayers who consider that their taxable income for 1982-83 will increase by less than the notional 10 per cent, or who consider that sufficient rebates have not been taken into account, to 'self-assess' and have the provision tax for 1982-83 recalculated on the basis of their own estimates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Formal Amendments
      </para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, the Bill makes a number of formal amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act necessitated by the change in title of, and other formal amendments to, the Social Services Act 1947 made recently by the Social Services Legislation Amendment Act 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       A memorandum explaining in some detail the technical aspects of this Bill has been made available to honourable senators.

By the amendment, the circumstances giving rise to the deductions will be described in a more general way so as to remove any unintended impression of views of a judgmental kind in relation to the sufferings of the people in Lebanon to whose relief the tax deductible gifts are to be channelled.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will declare the rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees- other than trustees of corporate unit trusts and superannuation funds-for the 1982-83 financial year and for the 1983-84 and subsequent financial years.
       </para>
       <para>
        In declaring these rates, the Bill will implement the Budget proposals to alter the personal income tax rate scale and to withdraw the benefit of the tax-free threshold from non-resident taxpayers generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will recall that in the Budget Speech the Treasurer announced that, with effect from 1 November 1982, the personal income tax burden would be substantially reduced by increasing the tax-free threshold from $4,195 to $4,595, by reducing the standard rate of tax from 32 to 30 per cent and by increasing the top of the standard rate step in the rate scale from $17,894 to $ 19,500.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures will provide the largest proportionate tax reductions to persons on low to average incomes.
       </para>
       <para>
        When taken with other Budget decisions, they will be of particular significance to families and those wholly or mainly dependent on pensions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increase in the top of the standard rate step will provide incentive to earn additional income without fear of moving into a higher tax bracket.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes will apply from 1 November 1982 and will be reflected in lower pay- as-you-earn deductions from that date.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also reflecting that commencement date, the rate scale for 1982-83 is to be an average of the 1981-82 rate scale and that to apply from 1 November 1982-made up of four-twelfths of the 1981-82 scale and eight-twelfths of the new scale.
       </para>
       <para>
        Application of this average scale will mean that for 1982-83 tax will not be payable by resident individuals until taxable income exceeds $4,462.
       </para>
       <para>
        The corresponding taxable income level last year was $4,195.
       </para>
       <para>
        The average scale will also mean that, up to a taxable income of $17,894 for 1982-83, the rate of tax payable will be 30.67 per cent-compared with 32 per cent last year-while for taxable incomes in the range of $17,894 to $19,500 the rate of tax applicable to the excess over $17,894 will be 35.33 per cent- compared with 46 per cent last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rates of tax declared by the Bill for 1983-84 and subsequent years give full effect to the reduction of the standard rate to 30 per cent and the increases in the top of the zero rate and standard rate steps to $4,595 and $19, 500 respectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        As also announced in the Budget Speech, the zero rate step in the rate scale ( or tax-free threshold) is no longer to be available to non-residents, other than those in receipt of taxable Australian social security and repatriation pensions .
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no tax-free amount available in respect of income such as dividends and interest received by non-residents-this income is subject to withholding tax -and the reasons for extending the threshold to residents are seldom relevant to non-residents.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will withdraw the threshold from non-residents with effect from 17 August 1982 (Budget day), except in relation to those non-residents who came to Australia on or before that date for a short working visit or who had made firm arrangements for such a visit by that date.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reflecting the date of effect of the withdrawal, a proportionate threshold of $ 585 will be available for 1982-83.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with the withdrawal of the tax-free threshold, the minimum taxable income levels presently applying to accumulating income of some non-resident trust estates and to certain income of non-resident minor children are also to be withdrawn from 17 August 1982, with proportionate amounts applying for 1982- 83.

        This Bill will amend the Income Tax (Mining Withholding Tax) Act 1979 which imposes tax on payments relating to the use of Aboriginal land for mining and exploration purposes. The rate of tax presently imposed is 6.4 per cent, representing, in effect, tax at the current standard rate of 32 per cent applied to one-fifth of the gross amount of the payments.

       <para>
        As a consequence of the reduction in the standard rate of tax to 30 per cent with effect from 1 November 1982, the rate of tax on mining payments made or applied on or after that date is to be reduced to 6 per cent.

         —In speaking to the first readings of the customs tariff Bills I want to raise a matter which has caused me grave concern over the last three years, and that is the way that South Australia has been managed under the Tonkin Liberal Government. The LCL-the Liberal Country League- had a very long reign in government until there was a parting of the ways and a bustup, as has often been the case. Now the LCL has one Country Party member in the House of Assembly. I think he still calls himself a Country Party member. However, I understand that after the election that party in South Australia will change its name to the National Party. It changes its suits according to the weather. The LCL remained in government for a long period because we had what was known in the State as the 'Playmander'. The electorates were very much rigged in favour of the LCL.

        Despite the fact that the Labor Party at election after election got a majority of the votes, it could not get a majority of members in the House of Assembly to form a government. However, in 1965 the Labor Party, under the leadership of the late Mr Frank Walsh broke through the barrier and was elected to government. We were defeated in 1968. The Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Hall, had a very short sojourn as government leader-two years as a matter of fact-before he was defeated. There was another split in the Liberal Party in South Australia after he was defeated and that led to the formation of what is known as the Liberal Movement. I notice that you, Madame Acting Deputy President, were a member of that party when you came into this place by appointment of the Dunstan Liberal Government. But then you changed your political colours and joined what is now known as the Australian Democrats.

         —I meant the Dunstan Labor Government. I do not think that anyone would ever pick me up on that slip of the tongue because Dunstan would never be a leader of the Liberal Party. However, we find that in the turmoils of politics the Democrats party in South Australia is now facing another tremendous split. I think because of that split the Democrats can kiss goodbye to the seat of Mitcham on 6 November, and that is very good news for the Liberal Party because that is one seat which it will get back. Mitcham was always a Liberal seat until Robin Millhouse bailed out. Of course, he was a member of the Liberal Movement as you were, Madam Acting Deputy President. Many other people who are now Government members were members of the Liberal Movement.

We are a very united party and we will continue to be. However, after we were defeated in 1968 Mr Hall became the premier. We were returned to government as a result of all the turmoil in 1970. We managed the State very successfully until 1979 when we saw one of the most scurrilous political campaigns ever conducted in South Australia. I am very worried that we will see the same sort of thing happen again.

        My Leader, Senator Button, had to rise in the chamber today and seek leave to make a statement about the commencement of this scurrilous attack which is conducted by the Adelaide News, a paper in the stable of Murdoch who has never been a friend of the Labor Party in South Australia. That paper published an article with the headline 'Threat to pension, dole rises'. This matter has been explained. However, newspapers containing that article appeared on the news stands in Adelaide on Wednesday of this week despite the fact that the social security legislation had been passed through this House at 24 minutes past 5 the previous evening. This is the sort of scandalous attack we are going to be faced with during the election campaign.

        But who else has surfaced and come out of the woodwork like a white ant-none other than Nigel Buick of Kingscote, Kangaroo Island, that bloke who was famous for all of the big full page advertisements in both the Adelaide News and the Advertiser prior to the 1979 elections. I do not know from where he gets the money to pay for these advertisements. However, one of these advertisements appeared on Tuesday signed by Nigel Buick of Kingscote. I do not know what sort of payoff he got from Tonkin after he helped him to be elected. But we will be very interested to have a look at this when we get back into government.

        All sorts of outrageous statements were made in these scurrilous ads, some of which were signed by 'concerned electors'. Some of these people did not even live in South Australia.

We will soon take it away from them. I give a warning that these people who have been used as stooges ought to be prepared after 6 November because they will get no truck from the Labor Government. We believe in honesty in government; we believe in a fair deal for the people who live in South Australia.

        The advertisement to which I have referred and which is authorised by Nigel Buick appeared in the News of 19 October. However, on 15 October the News ran an editorial headed 'And so to the polls'. The editorial stated:

        Could there be any more smearing than what we saw on the front page story of the News of yesterday? What could be more smearing by the very paper which saw fit to run that sanctimonious article asking the political parties not to indulge in smear techniques which that paper itself had triggered off? Of course, the paper accepted the ad from Nigel Buick. I suppose his money is good. I do not know what it costs to put a full page ad in the News-I imagine it would be somewhere in the vicinity of $1,500; it would not be much less.

People will get fishing licences on their merits and not for being party stooges. I am very proud of the State that I represent. I was reported in the daily Press today as being parochial. I make no apologies for that. I was sent here by the electors of South Australia to represent them. I have done my very best to do that in the eleven and a half years I have been in this place. I will continue to do it while I am here. I believe that the people of South Australia are decent, honest citizens. They need a government that will govern them in a way that will do justice to their living standards and to every other form of quality of life which they expect from South Australia. They have not been getting that sort of government in the last three years, unfortunately. The Government which is now in charge of South Australia's affairs was elected on one of its pledges to stop the job rot. I have had to give notice in this House of 11 motions to point up the chaos that the State is in and the financial situation it now faces. Every one of those notices of motion was based on absolute statistics which I got from the documents published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They are not a figment of the imagination; they are absolute fact and I stand by them. I have no reason to doubt what the ABS prints. I take cognisance of the fact that nobody on the Government side has seen fit to bring on those motions since I put them on the Notice Paper. I put the first one on the Notice Paper on 19 November 1981, nearly 12 months ago.

They knew that the figures I put down were correct. I would have welcomed a debate on them. I now look forward to the first Wednesday that the Senate sits after the South Australian election. I will be able to move for the notices of motion to be taken off the Notice Paper because the State will be back in good secure hands under the leadership of John Bannon. Then we can get on with the job of governing the State the way it ought to be governed, the way in which Mr Tonkin said it would be governed in his election policy speech of 1979. Yesterday I mentioned that Mr Tonkin was not too happy with his Federal Liberal Party members and the way they were not assisting him. Senator Teague took umbrage at those remarks. He got quite uptight about them. I was only quoting from Mr Tonkin's policy speech. That is what he said.

What else could be inferred from a statement like that in a Premier's policy speech? Nothing could be inferred other than the fact that he was not getting any worthwhile assistance from the Federal members of Parliament who represent the Liberal Party in South Australia . If they were doing their job as the Labor Party members do he would not need to waste the South Australian taxpayers' money by domiciling a representative in Canberra to act as a lobbyist to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), Ministers, statutory bodies and their senior officials, as he said he would do in his policy speech. Nothing can be construed from that statement except that he is not getting the co-operation of the people that the Liberal Party sent here. I would think that next time we have a Federal election there will be a few faces missing in this place. The Liberal Party will have to send people it can rely on. It will not be any hassle for Mr Tonkin as he will no longer be the leader of the Government in South Australia; we will be in office.

        I want to say a few words about some of the things that have happened and some of the things that have been said in the last three years. I will quote briefly from the Advertiser of 3 August 1979-that was prior to the election in September . Mr Tonkin was very outspoken in his criticism of the then Corcoran Labor Government. There is a black headline in the Adelaide Advertiser of 3 August 1979. It reads: 'Population rise lowest-Tonkin'. The article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        South Australia's population growth rate was the lowest in the State's history, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tonkin, told the Assembly yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what he said over three years ago. What is the population in South Australia now? South Australia is in a terrible position in that its population is the lowest of any State on the mainland. Mr Tonkin has presided over that situation. He is a man who, for political purposes, proposed to criticise the Corcoran Labor Government. But what has he done about the problem in three years ? I think he also said during the 1979 campaign that the electors of South Australia were voting with their feet. Well, they are voting with their feet at a much faster rate since he took over the reins of government. Now, our population figures are lower than those of Western Australia. Not only are members of the work force having to leave the State in an endeavour to get jobs but also businesses have left the State at a rapid rate. In the last 12 months not a week has gone by in which we did not pick up a newspaper and find out that businesses were closing down or that people were being put on short time. My colleague Senator Foreman has been raising the matter of Kelvinator Australia Ltd in the Parliament for quite some time. But what answers are we getting from the Government? We are getting nothing at all because it is not prepared to come out and make a statement as to what will happen to the 400 workers at Kelvinator .
       </para>
       <para>
        We also have a problem in the south-east of the State of which Mr Tonkin should have been aware. In September 1981 a statement appeared in the Australian Forest Industries Journal. It stated that the timber industry in South Australia was still in a depressed state. Mr Tonkin was forewarned about it. It is in a worse plight now because the south-east of South Australia, particularly the Mount Gambier area, has the highest unemployment level of any area in the State. What is Mr Tonkin doing about it? He is doing absolutely nothing. After the Labor Party had to make moves, we found that he got off his whatever one likes to call it and sent a telex to Mr Fraser saying that Mr Fraser ought to do something.
       </para>
       <para>
        On Tuesday I had the privilege of sitting in on an anti-dumping inquiry. The New Zealand contingent was there in force. It supported the import of softwood timber into Australia from New Zealand, and so did the importers. I hope that in the final washup some common sense will prevail and that the inquiry will actually prove that the import of cheap New Zealand timber is doing great harm to the people who live in the south-east. I am quite certain that after 6 November, when Mr Ken Bonython takes over the seat of Mount Gambier, we will have a strong voice in the South Australian Parliament to look after the interests of people in the Mount Gambier, Tantanoola, Nangwarry and Tarpeena areas. After 6 November South Australia can look forward to an uplift in its standard of living. That is something about which I will be joyous. It will be a sad day for everyone in South Australia if the Labor Party does not win the election on 6 November.

         —I wish in this first reading debate to speak on the second United Nations Special Session on Disarmament, which I had the privilege to attend for a few days, and Australia's contribution to that Session and disarmament in general. A discussion of that Session might logically start with the first UNSSOD I, which was held four years previously. At that conference the international community accepted certain basic principles which it embodied in its final document. This document has become part of the bible of disarmament. It accepted that it was unreal to discuss disarmament without accepting the legitimate object of security on the part of each state. Security, of course, has been traditionally thought of in terms of more and better quality armaments. However, it was then recognised that the accumulation of weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, constituted much more a threat than a protection to the future of mankind. This was well put by Lord Louis Mountbatten in 1979. He, of course, was a victim of the intolerance and violence of man. He said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Wars cannot be fought with nuclear weapons. Their existence only adds to our perils because of the illusion they have created.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pause to remind the Senate that the UN recently estimated that there are more than 40,000 nuclear warheads in the world today. Their total explosive strength makes them equivalent to about one million Hiroshima bombs or 30 tonnes of trinitrotoluene for every man, woman and child on earth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, in that final document, the international community accepted the relationship between expenditure on armaments and economic and social development, or the lack thereof. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the economic and social consequences of the arms race are so detrimental that its continuation is obviously incompatible with the implementation of the new international economic order based on justice, equity and co-operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thus the ultimate goal, it concluded, should be general and complete disarmament under effective international control. Certain priorities were agreed, including :
       </para>
       <para>
        Halting and reversing the nuclear arms race
       </para>
       <para>
        Preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons
       </para>
       <para>
        Developing and improving measures to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war
       </para>
       <para>
        Prohibiting or preventing the development, production or use of other weapons of mass destruction
       </para>
       <para>
        A balanced reduction of armed forces and of conventional armaments
       </para>
       <para>
        A program of action was determined and the Committee on Disarmament was set up. It was to have the major role in negotiating the implementation of that plan of action during the following four years until UNSSOD II. Australia was selected as a member of that Committee. A brief look at the progress of the Committee gives some indication of the progress of multinational disarmament during that period of four years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee reported to UNSSOD II that its work towards a nuclear test ban treaty had continued but had not been satisfactorily concluded; that its work towards cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament had similarly continued but an agreed basis for negotiations in the Committee had not been found. It said that fundamental differences over such strategic doctrines as 'no first use' had meant that little progress had been made in this area. The Committee had continued to look for an effective international agreement to assure non-nuclear states against the use, or threat of the use, of nuclear weapons. Again, it had not been able to reach agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the area of chemical weapons, the Committee had been heading towards the objective of developing a convention and had made some progress. On the subject of new types of weapons of mass destruction, which are being referred to these days as radiological weapons, the Committee said that it had, similarly, been making some progress. In relation to the task of preparing a Comprehensive Program of Disarmament it had achieved, by UNSSOD II, a draft, although heavily bracketted, to be considered by the Special Session. It had looked to and made some progress in other areas such as the prevention of the arms race in outer space.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thus the progress made by the Committee in the last four years could at best be described as modest. Unfortunately, it fell foul of the international climate. As was said in the report of the Australian delegation to the 1981 session of the Committee on Disarmament:
       </para>
       <para>
        The main impediments to the Committee achieving quicker and more tangible results do not lie in the Committee's own procedures or composition but in the general international climate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the timing of UNSSOD II in many ways could not have been worse. I refer to the Falklands war, and to the Iran-Iraq war, and to the war in the Lebanon. The United Nations General Assembly President, Ismait T. Kittani of Iraq, put the failure in perspective when he noted that the session had taken place, 'during one of the most disturbing junctures in international relations'. He correctly surmised that it would be an illusion to expect the United Nations to insulate itself from the general climate and relations among states-where mistrust, conflict, a growing sense of insecurity and resort to force continued to prevail-and to produce miracles.
       </para>
       <para>
        UNSSOD II met for five weeks during June and July of this year but, regrettably , the Special Session was largely a failure. It was unable to adopt a document on a Comprehensive Program of Disarmament prepared by its first working group. It was not even able to agree upon a statement concerning the progress made since 1978, which was the function of its second working group. However, it was able to agree upon a world disarmament campaign and the granting of certain fellowships. The Special Session noted that developments since 1978 had not lived up to the hopes engendered by the First Special Session on Disarmament. In its final communique, it stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The objectives, priorities and principles (laid down in the Final Document in 1978) have not been generally observed. The Program of Action contained in the Final Document remains largely unimplemented. The arms race, however, particularly nuclear arms race, has assumed more dangerous proportions and global military expenditures have increased sharply. In short, since the adoption of the Final Document in 1978, there has been no significant progress in the field of arms limitation, disarmament and the seriousness of the situation has increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, the communique observed deterioration in some areas:
       </para>
       <para>
        The past four years have witnessed increasing recourse to the use of, or threat of use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, military intervention, occupation, annexation and interference in the internal affairs of States and a denial of the inalienable rights of self-determination and independence of people under colonial or foreign domination.
       </para>
       <para>
        The General Assembly did, however, unanimously reaffirm the validity of the Final Document of the First Special Session-for what that is worth-and the solemn commitment of member states to it, with a pledge to respect the priorities in disarmament negotiations, as agreed upon in its program of action.
       </para>
       <para>
        In light of the failure of UNSSOD II, it appears to me to be necessary to review the contribution and responsibility of Australia. Australia played a significant role in that Special Session as a member of its planning committee, a member of the Bureau, and in chairing one of the three working groups. This is consistent with the quite prominent role it has played in the Committee on Disarmament. I pause to commend the Australian delegation for its professionalism and dedication. There was untiring effort by our delegation to achieve something constructive from the session and for that it deserves commendation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has always accepted that disarmament is a security issue. Its contribution to the disarmament process has therefore been from the stance of a member of the Western alliance. It does not take positions contrary to the security interests of that alliance. That is a stance with which I would agree. But within that contest Australia has supported the goal of disarmament and the negotiation of balanced and verifiable measures of arms control. Australia has recognised the need for a step by step approach. In particular, it has laid great emphasis on developing verification procedures. States will not agree to a mutual disarmament, consistent with their security obligations, unless they can be satisfied that such disarmament is, in fact, mutual. Thus Australia has been contributing in the area of seismic verification and also as part of the international satellite monitoring system. This should continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        More specifically, Australia has given the highest priority to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons-first by its continued support of the nuclear non- proliferation treaty-which is concerned with horizonal proliferation-secondly, by advocating the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty which would ban the testing of nuclear weapons by all states in all environments; and thirdly, through the development of an international consensus on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The first two points it has pursued in the Committee on Disarmament and UNSSOD II. Also, its research in the verification area is contributing to slow progress. That progress should continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the third point, it is of interest to note that the final document of UNSSOD I stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        International co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be conducted under agreed and appropriate international safeguards applied on a non -discriminatory basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has played a leading role in the development of appropriate international safeguards and should continue to do so. Australia supports the concept of a comprehensive program of disarmament but has realistically recognised the disparity of views on the subject and the difficulty of obtaining a consensus. This work will continue in the Committee on Disarmament and should be directed, particularly, towards limiting the areas of dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additionally, Australia is committed, and has significantly contributed, to the objective of negotiating an international convention which would ban the production of chemical weapons and require existing stocks and their means of production to be destroyed. This effort also is obviously worth continuing. Any treaty success will be based on greater mutual respect and trust in the world. Therefore, Australia has a diplomatic role to play. Since it enjoys considerable respect in Third World countries particularly because of its stand on the North- South dialogue, Australia should be prepared to upgrade its role in this field. Algeria is showing a lead as an arbitrator.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, we must be prepared to support peacekeeping forces, monitoring forces and the like such as we have in Zimbabwe, in the Sinai, and will have in Namibia. We have a particular responsibility in relation to localised disputes and difficulties in our region. Regional disputes have the potential to flare into major international crises. The problems concerning the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border and certain Pacific nations come to mind. Australia supports the Association of South East Asian Nations, concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South East Asia and also subscribes to the objective of establishing a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. It is aware of the difficulties in this regard and is approaching the matter realistically. It is interesting to note that in the report of the delegation to the Thirty-sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly it was stated that we are attempting to work towards a 'harmonisation of views' in relation to the Indian Ocean.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also have a responsibility with our natural resources. We must be prepared to accept, on reasonable terms, that our natural resources must be shared, particularly with those countries which are experiencing shortages. The realisation that the peace, security and development of Australia depends on the security and development of other countries in our region is also important and a pragmatic justification for the North-South dialogue if one is needed. Australia should continue to support and in fact play a leading role in disarmament conferences. The emphasis of the super-powers towards bilateral negotiations should not allow the role of the international community as a whole to be usurped.
       </para>
       <para>
        Security through disarmament to replace security through armament is a challenge that cannot be avoided, notwithstanding that it is alien to conventional security concepts.
       </para>
       <para>
        How can it be better understood? Arguments are mounting for an Australian peace research institute to invigorate public debate on a better informed basis, to provide government with researched alternatives to conventional policy, to look to the effectiveness of multilateral organisations, research alternative co- operative approaches to conflict solving, more effective systems of international arbitration and the like. One could look at the Peace Research Institute in Oslo, the Centre for Peace and Security Studies of the United Nations University, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and others. Conventional answers to problems of security and peace are no longer sufficient in themselves. Community education in the area is vitally important and the world disarmament campaign, which we support, should help.
       </para>
       <para>
        As an ally of the United States, one of the two major nuclear powers, Australia should press its ally towards consideration of peaceful alternatives, particularly so in view of the massive size and strength of the armaments industry within the United States and the vested interests of that lobby in perpetuating the arms race. We will do so more effectively if we are better informed. That shows the importance of research bodies. The final report of UNSSOD II concluded with a somewhat plaintive cry:
       </para>
       <para>
        It was the hope of member States that UNSSOD II and its failure would, in itself, provide a powerful impetus for the international community to re-double its efforts in the cause of disarmament.
       </para>
       <para>
        This applies also to Australia and to all of us.

         —I take the opportunity of the debate on the motion for the first reading of the Customs Tariff Bill 1982 to raise a matter which I believe is important. The majority of the population of this country today is living in an ever present fear-a fear of doing without. This fear has been brought about by Liberal governments, whether they be State or Federal governments. There is no security today for the people in this country. I believe that is a great disgrace to any government, whether it be State or Federal. Australia has approximately 15 million people. The majority of those people are very well educated and healthy people. On top of that, we have great natural resources. Australians should feel that they have some security because of those natural resources. A country such as Australia that has a very small population and huge natural resources should be in far better shape than Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let us examine what is happening to the ordinary people in this country. Everyone in the community-from managers to the people who sweep the floor-fears that he will lose his job. Because of the fear that is raging throughout the community everyone has stopped buying. People are putting off buying a refrigerator, a motor car or any other product. Consequently, if there is no confidence in the country a lot of people are automatically put out of work. This is what is happening today. I believe that politicians, whether they be State or Federal, have relied far too much on the academics and taken far too much notice of people with academic qualifications instead of relying on people with some common sense. I believe that we could overcome our problems if we did that. There is no need to import large quantities of material into this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the war we were cut off from the rest of the world. A great proportion of the supplies for not only our troops but also the American forces came from this country. Everyone was employed as a result of the use of Australian resources. We had very little industry at the start of that conflict. We had to build up industries in a very short time and we had to rely on our own resources . In that period we had the only true Australian government. We did not rely on England; we did not ask America what to do or what not to do. We used our own initiative and got on with the job. We fought a war that was very costly. As I said, we provided supplies to the armies that had to fight that war. We manufactured all the munitions, we produced the food and we manufactured the materials that were needed to fight that war and that were needed by the community. Even after the war everyone was in full employment, simply because we did not import many products; we manufactured them ourselves. We relied on our own resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australians on the whole show a great deal of initiative. They can do jobs which it is difficult to do. Governments today are not giving young people or anyone else in the community an opportunity to fulfil a role in society. Many people are out of work today and unnecessarily so. I believe that is the worst thing that is happening in Australia at the present time. We are destroying people. I believe that people are the most important asset of any nation. Without people a nation is nothing. Life is meaningless if we do not look after our children and grandchildren. If we, as politicians, cannot create a place in our society for our people we should not be here. I believe that politicians in my State of South Australia have done a terrible job in trying to employ people. They have driven industry away. Federally, we are not taking up the cudgels for those who are unemployed. Australia needs a Bill of Rights. That Bill of Rights should not be a politicial football. It should not be a privilege to have good health, education or a job; it should be a guaranteed right. Until politicians start to think along those lines we will not get anywhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, today we are destroying our people, whether they be young, middle aged or elderly. The people of this country feel that they are not wanted. Unless people are prepared to go out and expand their knowledge they develop bad habits. If young people-I do not care whether it is the children of honourable senators opposite or my children-are unemployed and feel that they are not wanted by our community, naturally they will adopt bad ways. I believe it is a disgrace and a criminal offence to destroy our young people in this way, which is what we are doing to them. We have in this country the knowledge to turn the raw materials available to us into the goods that we require. I believe that it is possible, with the help of the Government, the trade union movement and management, to employ everyone in this country. There has never been an honest attempt to bring together all sections of the community. We are in trouble now and we are doing very little about it. Irrespective of what point of view one holds in politics today, we are true Australians and we must raise some spirit of nationalism. It has been raised; we saw it at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games . We should be proud to be Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Hill talked about defence and disarmament. Australia, through its governments, is not trying to preserve peace. We send people to attend conferences and do many things but we do not take up the initiative to slow down the arms race. That is essential. The world cannot afford to spend more than $1m a minute on arms. People are being destroyed not only in this country but throughout the world. We must reduce the amount spent on armaments. We must have a better understanding between people in the world. Unless this comes about we will get nowhere. If every one of us took one-third of our pay and burnt it every week we would be in financial difficulties. Yet this virtually is what countries of the world are doing with expenditure on armaments-taking huge sums of moneys and throwing them into the fire. There is no security for working people, small business people or even large enterprises. There is no confidence in this country and in many others.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this country can overcome its problems. We take the attitudes of professional people. That is the worst thing to do. What is lacking in this country and in the world is common sense. It is about time that we got back to common sense. It is about time that we got back to realising that people are valuable and that we should do something about them. The situation cannot go on. If we allow it to go on we will create the greatest turmoil, ills and violence et cetera. We have created them. We cannot blame people for turning against society. That is the great cost. We must take note of the mistakes that have been made in other countries. In any city anywhere in the world one sees pockets of poverty. Unless governments direct finance and people into those areas where great poverty exists that poverty is self-perpetuating. It passes from father to son. Eventually it is a festering sore. It should be cleaned up. We should not have pockets of poverty and ignorance. We should spend more money on education and ensuring that people are healthy. Without security, people feel that they are not contributing to a country. Life must be purposeful and meaningful.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unless people have that attitude we cannot expand and advance as a nation. We should be a great nation and we could be a great nation. We should be an example to many other countries. Australians have a very good attitude to life. We should be setting an example to the rest of the nations of the world. It worries me that there are only 22 democratic countries left in the world. That is a frightening thought. I am a democratic socialist but I do not have any truck with dictatorships or such things. That is the worst sort of government. I cannot, never have and never will accept that. The Australian attitude of giving the other person a fair go is marvellous. We have much to offer and much to show the rest of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not doing enough in the fields of foreign affairs and disarmament. We should play a more positive role in those fields. We should not worry about whether a person is from the Right or the Left or whether a country is following some of the communist countries. If we went out to show some positive thinking we would probably drag some of those countries away from that line of thought. It would be in our interests and in the interests of the world to do that. It disturbs me that we are not doing sufficient in this field. In my State the economy is sinking lower and lower. There are more young unemployed people than ever before. That disturbs me. I am not trying to score a political point. I think it is about time that we all started to think of people as being valuable. It disturbs me when a person is young and unemployed in South Australia, or in any other State. We are totally destroying them.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can make everything that we need in this country without running to import everything. We should try to increase our productivity. We should go to the unions and to management to try to get sensible industrial agreements instead of knocking this one and that one. Certainly, we have differences of opinion; that is good and healthy. But we should think of one thing: We are Australians and we should be very proud Australians. The only way that we can achieve some sort of future for our people is to get together and learn to manage our country better. In the first place, Australia should be for Australians. I do not mean that in the narrow sense that we should not help other people; we have a moral duty to do that.

         —The benefits from the development of our national resources are going overseas. Australians are not getting the real benefits from those resources. That is disturbing. Some time ago we were told that the huge mineral boom would be of great benefit to Australia. It has not happened. More people are becoming unemployed. That is very disturbing. We are not getting the value out of our minerals that we should be getting. We should be manufacturing more, and learning to do it more professionally. If there were an honest attempt to do this we could compete with any country in the world. I have seen Australians pull together in time of war and in very difficult times. No people in this world are better than Australians. Australia is a great country and Australians are great people. It disturbs me that we are so poorly managed. It is about time that Australians started to think and to pull themselves up by their boot straps . We can do it and we should be doing it. One day it will come about.

         —I wish to raise a matter of importance to all South Australians-the tragic unemployment situation in South Australia which has developed under the Tonkin Liberal Government and the deliberate attempt by that Government and its supporters to deceive the voting public of South Australia. Since the Tonkin Government came to power in 1979 employment in South Australia has grown by only something like 1,800 while employment in Australia as a whole has increased by a total of 300,000. In other words, as my colleague Senator Bolkus pointed out yesterday in his notice of motion, South Australia has had only a miserable one half of one per cent of total employment growth in Australia, while it accounts for something like 9 per cent of the Australian work force. For nearly three years now, South Australia has had the highest unemployment of all Australian mainland states. The latest figures confirm the disaster.

        In the twelve months to August 1982 a total of 7,100 jobs have gone in South Australia. These job losses have been worse among full time workers. In the year ending August 1982, 12,000 full time jobs were lost in South Australia. Over the last 12 months South Australia has fared much worse than any other State with the exception of Tasmania. Total employment fell by 1.3 per cent compared to only 0.5 per cent in New South Wales and 0.1 per cent in Victoria.

        Since January this year there has been an increasing number of retrenchments. Let me list them. Since the beginning of 1982, 330 workers have been retrenched by General Motors-Holden's Ltd; 47 workers have been retrenched by Gerard Industries Pty Ltd; 75 by Sapfor Timber Mills Ltd; 279 by Kelvinator Australia Ltd, with the possibility of another 400; 125 by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd , and another 340 on the way; 100 by NEI Engineering at Whyalla; 100 by the Mount Barker Tannery; 12 by Clyde Engineering (S.A.) Pty Ltd; 50 by Kenwood Pty Ltd; 95 by Tubemakers of Australia Ltd; 30 by Adelaide and Wallaroo Fertilizers; six by Wunderlich Windows; 20 by Messenger Press Pty Ltd; eight by Hannaford and Co. Pty Ltd; five by Parcelboard Pty Ltd; 105 by Atco Industries (Aust.) Pty Ltd at Elizabeth; 27 by Dulux Aust. Ltd; and three by Simes and Martin Pty Ltd. Only yesterday, hundreds of workers at Adelaide's Kelvinator plant decided to accept a 4 day working week with a cut in pay to save their jobs. So much for industry' s confidence in the South Australian Government. So much for Mr Tonkin's promise in his 1979 election policy speech to create 7,000 new jobs.

        The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures confirm the downward trend in South Australia. In September of this year, unemployment reached a record 51, 200 people, which is 8.5 per cent of the work force. This is more than one percentage point above the national figure and represents an increase in unemployment over the last 12 months of a staggering 7 per cent. August and September 1982 will certainly not be forgotten because they represent the first time since the Second World War that South Australia has had unemployment figures in excess of 50,000. The most horrifying aspect of South Australia's unemployment situation is the fact that the unemployment rate amongst 15 to 19 year olds has reached a whopping 29 per cent. This is the highest youth unemployment rate of any Australian state. It is even higher than Tasmania. Twenty-nine per cent of young South Australians are now out of work, that is, one in every three. No wonder our young people are leaving.

        Under the Tonkin regime, South Australia's population has fallen below Western Australia's for the first time ever. During 1980-81, a record 7,700 South Australians left the State to go to other parts of Australia, notably Sydney and Melbourne where there are Labor governments, of course. South Australia has rapidly gone to the dogs under Mr Tonkin.
       </para>
       <para>
        The latest job vacancy figures show clearly why many people are leaving the State. In August there were only 1,000 new jobs in South Australia, just 4.7 per cent of the national total. This meant that for every job vacancy there were 50 unemployed people, compared to the national average of 21 people. Since 1979, the number of unemployed people for every job vacancy has risen from 20 to 50. That is an increase of 150 per cent. No wonder people are leaving.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many concerned people I have spoken to have also complained about the erosion of civil liberties under the Tonkin Government. They point to the Attorney- General's banning of films at the International Film Festival two years ago, which in effect put an end to the festival for all time. They point to the harassment by the police of gay people which is now taking place, no doubt under the direction of the Minister for Wowsers, as he is sometimes known, Mr Griffin, and his friend Mr Olsen. They point to the introduction of new laws which give police greater powers to search anyone they believe may be infringing the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Tonkin's only so-called claims to achievement are the rather hastily constructed international terminal funded by the Federal Government and the new Hilton Hotel, which was labelled by Mr Tonkin when in opposition as a 'socialist dream'. Adelaide has Mr Dunstan and the former Labor Government to thank for the Hilton Hotel. While this incompetent State Government boasts about its non- achievements, small businesses have suffered badly in South Australia under the Tonkin regime. The hotel and restaurant trades in South Australia have been badly affected by the introduction of random breath testing. Many small businesses have been affected by the refusal of the State Government to lift the general payroll tax exemption. I notice the Liberals have attempted to bribe small businessmen by promising to lift the exemption if they win the election. The fact that it has taken an election to do this is a measure of the Tonkin Liberal Government's concern for small business people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The building industry has also been a victim of the Tonkin regime. In the 3 months ending August 1982, new dwelling approvals in South Australia totalled 1901, down 8.5 per cent over the same period last year. For houses in the private sector, approvals were down by 10.5 per cent. Dwelling commencements in South Australia in the June quarter represented only 7 per cent of the national total, well below South Australia's share of the national population.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most significant factors affecting home building in South Australia, apart from interest rates, is the fact that under the Tonkin Government the State has had the highest increase in building costs in Australia. Apart from skyrocketing mortgage repayments, there has also been a whole host of increases in State charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        Every single family or household in South Australia has been affected by the huge increases in electricity and gas bills, water rates, council rates, bus and train fares and motor vehicle registration fees under the Liberal Government. Mr Tonkin had the audacity to claim in his 1982-83 Budget speech that the Government had avoided increasing State tax rates in 1982-83. What he did not say was that he actually put up motor vehicle registration rates in April and licences, under the Business Franchise (Petroleum Products) Act, went up in May. What he also omitted to say was that in 1982-83, as a result of his Government actions, total State taxes in the form of the electricity trust levy, land tax, motor vehicle registrations, and so on, will rise by $12.5m. State taxation revenue will actually increase by 11.5 per cent in 1982-83. If we look at the figures for taxation per head of population, it is quite clear that there has been a massive increase in taxes under Mr Tonkin. Taxation per capita increased from $296 in 1978-79 under Labor to $414 in 1982-83. This represents an increase of 40 per cent. No wonder retail sales in South Australia and new motor vehicle registrations are still below the national level. So much for the achievements of the Tonkin Government.

       <para>
        Our manufacturing industries are falling apart at the seams, yet all the Tonkin Government can do is talk about pie-in-the-sky programs for 1990. What is Mr Tonkin doing about the 400 workers who face possible retrenchment at Kelvinator? What about the 100 workers that GMH is poised to retrench after the election? Where are these people going to get jobs? What about 1983, 1984, 1985 and all the other years?

        Once again, the Liberals are engaging in a dishonest, muckraking campaign in an attempt to deceive the voters of South Australia. Already we are seeing some of the Liberal Party's members and supporters inserting emotional and pathetic full page newspaper advertisements.
       </para>
       <para>
        A Mr Nigel Buick, a farmer from Kangaroo Island whom Senator McLaren mentioned a few moments ago, is again being used by friends and members of the Liberal Party to insert scaremongering advertisements in the daily papers. I am told that the cost for these is being met by a wellknown Adelaide car dealer, who is probably a member of the Liberal Party. I wonder whether these people will be offered discounts by the News as they apparently were during the last State election campaign. As far as I am concerned there is no need for this sort of emotional hogwash in an election campaign. There is no need for the scaremongering and brainwashing of the type perpetrated by Mr Buick and his car dealer friends. The South Australian public deserves to be treated with a bit more respect than is being shown by these so-called friends of the Liberal Party . What is more, they deserve a bit more honesty and integrity from their Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Never before have South Australians been subject to the sort of incompetence and brainwashing that the Liberals have indulged in over the last three years. Time and again the airwaves have been full of the corny jingles devised by business friends of the Liberal Party to try to convince South Australians that their State is great. If all of this money were put into promoting South Australia outside its borders, interstate and overseas, the tourists would pour in by the thousands. If South Australia's business leaders were more progressive and less bogged down with the past, perhaps South Australian industry would be better placed to ride out the recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Labor Party is committed to revitalising the South Australian economy. It will provide jobs now and in the forseeable future, not just in 1990; not just in rural South Australia but also in Adelaide. It is committed to giving every possible assistance to our small business people because we recognise the vital role they play in the South Australian economy. It is committed also to giving every possible assistance to our ailing manufacturing industries to help them through these bad times and to project them into the next decade with a feeling of confidence. I hope, for the sake of all South Australians, that common sense will prevail on 6 November and that the people of South Australia will elect a Bannon State Labor government.

         —I take advantage of this first reading debate to refer to a problem which an increasing number of Australians feel ought to become the responsibility of government, as well as the community and the popular Press. I commend the initiative taken by the editor-in-chief of the Sunday Telegraph, Ita Buttrose, who in the last four issues of the Sunday Telegraph has dealt with the problem of junk food and obesity in children. Obviously attempts are being made within the fast food industry, and in the food industry generally, to put us in a defensive position as far as school canteens are concerned. Ita Buttrose has dealt with a matter which I have raised with the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), who is at the table this afternoon , and his predecessor, the present Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. Both are on the public record as having expressed some three or four years ago the view that the Commonwealth Government should take a great deal more initiative in respect of preventive medicine. We can only say that in the intervening period the Government's activity in this area, despite attempts by the Commonwealth Department of Health, has been insufficient and inadequate. The Government has failed in its responsibilities.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is abundant evidence to show that the problems of public health, particularly as they relate to heart problems, begin in the very early years of life. This pattern of health behaviour and development starts largely at the school canteen. Therefore, the attempts of Ita Buttrose to draw the attention of the community at large to these problems are to be commended. In fact, they are an indictment of the Government's inability and failure to act in this important area of diet. Ita Buttrose, in her articles beginning on 26 September, draws attention to the endeavours of the medical profession to create a public awareness, a public concern, in the hope that attempts will be made by governments to enter this area and intervene in such a way as to protect the community from the commercialisation and influence of television, which creates in the minds of many of the members of our community a belief that they are acting properly and responsibly when purchasing junk food. She says in her original article:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is wide medical concern about the health of Australian children and I fear the root cause of the problem is that parents are less fussy than my mother about what their children eat and drink.
       </para>
       <para>
        Studies of Australian children have shown that they suffer from poor dental health, obesity, underweight, poor physical fitness, constipation, high levels of fatty substances in the blood and elevated blood pressure.
       </para>
       <para>
        In subsequent weeks she has continued to draw the attention of the readers of this large-circulation Sunday newspaper to this problem. That has led a number of people to write letters to her. Some have condemned the campaign being run by the editor of that paper and others, such as those in last week's edition, showed that she enjoys a great deal of public support from those members of the community who are concerned about this problem. Since she has raised the issue a couple of articles have appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald. They indicate that her campaign is having some effect, because within the school system itself there is, I suppose one could say, a revolt by more conscious students about the sort of food and drinks sold in canteens. She has enjoyed a remarkable response from the people involved in the area of nutrition, and that leads me to express my dismay that the words uttered in this place in regard to preventive medicine by both Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and Senator Baume several years back have not been carried into effect at all. They can only be regarded as being rhetorical and an abdication of responsibility by the Government because of the vested interests that clearly exist in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        This brings us to an understanding of the role that television plays in the promotion of fast food. In that respect, a paper was presented at the 1979 Australia and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science Conference by Josephine F. Rogers in which she drew attention to a major effort being undertaken at that stage by the fast food outlets, using the television medium to promote their articles for sale, and the fact that that was having an undue influence on the thinking of parents and children. In her paper she drew attention to the fact that, whilst most people eat to satisfy psychological and sociological needs, few are concerned with health and nutrition. She drew attention to the fact that American fast food chains had arrived in Australia. She stated that, surprisingly, the three big operators in Australia-McDonald's hamburgers, Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd and Pizza Hut Australia Pty Ltd had moved very heavily into the area of sale via the influence of television.

        In a position paper entitled 'In Support of a Nutrition Policy for School Canteens' which was prepared by the Australian Nutrition Foundation and the Dental Health Foundation of Australia delivered only in September 1982, the attention of the general public was drawn to the fact that the school canteen is seen as an integral part of the school and it should illustrate and complement classroom programs. The paper pointed to the need to have an educational role in our multicultural society. The paper stated that nutrition is important to health throughout life and it is particularly important at times of rapid growth and development, which include the school years. The paper continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        For the many students who use the canteen regularly the food purchased there makes a significant contribution to total food intake and nutrition.
       </para>
       <para>
        In spite of our abundance of food and comparative affluence there is much evidence associating health problems and disease with the diet pattern of Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although most lifestyle diseases are diagnosed in adulthood, early risk factors and symptoms begin to develop in childhood and the eating habits of children may contribute to diseases later in life.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another report which is available through the Parliamentary Library shows that studies on the relationships between a diet and coronary heart disease indicate that elevated blood cholesterol levels begin during childhood and adolescence. An article was written by Elizabeth Fanning, who is a reader in Preventive Dentistry at the Department of Dental Health of the University of Adelaide, entitled 'The diet of school children: role of the canteen'. Sydney newspapers a month or two ago reported the manner in which the Coca Cola organisation was going out of its way to fight against the attempts being made by the South Australian Minister of Education and the New South Wales Minister for Education who have taken steps in recent times to exercise a greater degree of interest in and control of the sorts of food and drink that are sold in school canteens.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are really concerned about the growth in medicine and health care costs generally in Australia, I do not believe we can ignore the fact that so much of this begins at the establishment of canteen facilities in our schools. Therefore , there is a need for governments, in the State and Federal spheres, to take much more interest in the development of what is happening and the influences that do exist which lead children and parents to be overinfluenced by cultural and other aspects through per force of the media. This brings us to the conclusion that there is a need for some government interest in this area I understand that we have a time problem; therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —I rise briefly to draw my remarks to a conclusion. I began them last evening when I spoke on the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill 1982. I emphasised the generous nature of the proposed measures and the promptness of the Government's response to drought circumstances which have probably never before been seen in this country either in regard to the duration of the drought -running from between two and three years in some areas and up to four years in others-or in regard to the fact that the measures cover very significant areas of at least four Australian States. This has mean that there is none of the normal relief that is generally available in a drought situation. There are literally no places to go. I highlighted, I hope, the appropriate guidelines and criteria that have been developed concerning the establishment of a proper eligibility for the interest and fodder subsidies. In circumstances where taxpayers' funds are being committed, it is important that there is a very responsible attitude taken in relation to drawing the lines of eligibility for whatever provisions are required.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        During the debate there has been some comment on the need to establish a system of drought insurance in this country. This is an interesting and an important concept. The Government looked at it many years ago-from memory, I think it was as far back as 1967-in the form of drought bonds. In a large measure these have been superseded nowadays by income equalisation deposits. That represents another means of holding some form of power in reserve, as it were, for these extraordinary, one would hope, circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst the idea of drought insurance is worthy of in-depth investigation, I think it is reasonable to recall some of the measures which this Government has taken over the past six or seven years in the form of incentives which are very significantly designed to aid the development of primary industry and particularly to aid its capacity and determination to look after itself in conditions of drought and in the many difficult situations that occur in the conduct of primary industry. The industry experiences difficulties not only as a result of climatic conditions by also because it is so dependent on world markets. The industry has little control over the very areas and circumstances in which it seeks to sell its produce.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation such as that which implemented an investment allowance and a generous depreciation scheme-which was recently made more generous-and tax deductibilities for the conservation of fodder, soil and water, represents a direct contribution to the capacity of primary industry to defend itself against drought, although these measures have proved to be not quite equal to the task in the circumstances which confront us today. Equally the abolition of the estate duty and the averaging of incomes are areas which have enabled the primary producing units to remain of basically viable size and a large amount of the dismembering of economic units has ceased.
       </para>
       <para>
        I close my remarks by saying that the drought, serious as it is, has made Australians aware of at least two things: The dependence across the board, particularly in extra-metropolitan Australia, on primary industry and the interdependence of all those who live and operate in the towns, villages and provincial cities of Australia and ultimately of the cities themselves. I commend the legislation. I believe it has been a fast and comprehensive response to a most unfortunate circumstance.

         —In speaking to the Drought Assistance ( Primary Producers) Bill 1982 I want, firstly, to refute a remark which was made in this chamber yesterday by Senator Carrick in dealing with another matter. When the Opposition sought to have some matters referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for examination, Senator Carrick said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is nothing that the Labor Party dislikes more than helping the farming community.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a complete untruth. Senator Carrick knows it is but he persists, as do honourable senators behind him, in making the same statement both in and out of this place. The Australian Labor Party has a very fine record over many years in helping the farming community. I go right back to the days of the late Mr Reg Pollard as a Minister in a Labor government. He introduced the superphosphate subsidy bounty. I also remember what was done by a colleague who was my leader in this place for some time and who is now the Leader of the Opposition in the State Parliament in Tasmania. It was under his guidance as the Minister for Agriculture that the Labor Government introduced the floor price for wool.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many other things that I could go into. We have endeavoured at all times to assist the farming community on a fair and equal basis wherever possible. I emphatically deny the statements that have been made by honourable senators opposite in trying to gain a cheap bit of kudos in the electorate and in trying to hoodwink farmers into believing that we are not concerned. One has only to look at the honourable senators on this side of the House. At least four of us in here at the moment have been practising farmers. Senator Walsh, who came in for some very severe criticism by the previous speaker, Senator Scott, was a practising farmer in Western Australia for many years before he became a member of this place. My colleague Senator Primmer was a dairy farmer. I was a poultry farmer, but prior to that I was engaged for many years in the pastoral industry as a shearer. No one would know better than I about the effect of the ravages of drought on sheep. I have had to handle sheep which were nothing better than skeletons and which were brought to the shearing sheds in spring carts, lorries and drays to be shorn. I have viewed the effect of those traumas on not only livestock but also the people who endeavour to eke a living from the land. The Labor Party is concerned to ensure that the very wealthy section of the community does not get some benefit at the expense of the people on lesser incomes. I refer to the Pitt Street, Collins Street and Rundle Street farmers who, in the true sense, are not real farmers; they are investors.
       </para>
       <para>
        I took umbrage at the statement made by Senator Scott in speaking about the amendment which was moved by my colleague Senator Walsh. I wrote down the words he used. He claimed that the amendment was insulting. There is nothing insulting about the amendment which was moved by Senator Walsh. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) a limit should be set on the sum that any individual may receive in any one year;
       </para>
       <para>
        What is insulting about that? Why is it insulting to try to place a limit on what the taxpayer has to pay to people in desperate circumstances because of the drought? If we do not place a limit on it the possibility is that many people will have access to this drought relief money while other people will have very hard times trying to get any. The amendment continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) eligibility should be determined by a ceiling on total assets instead of the proposed liquidity test; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) those persons who are predominantly dependent on their farm for their living should be objectively defined'.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is so insulting about trying to define the people who are predominantly dependent on their farms for their living? I go further and say that there should be a register of the recipients. Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber continually complain about dole bludgers. These so-called dole bludgers have to line up in a queue every fortnight to put in their work sheet at the Department of Social Security to enable them to continue to get their dole payments. They have to do that in the full glare of the public wherever there is a regional or main office of the Department of Social Security or the Commonwealth Employment Service. They have to parade in front of the public because of their unfortunate circumstances-they cannot get jobs. If they have to do that, there is no reason why the people who will be recipients of the drought relief should not be listed on some register which is available for public perusal. After all, something like $360m of taxpayers' money is involved in this matter. If my memory serves me right, Senator Carrick said yesterday that it could be as high as $600m. There has to be some record kept of the names of the people receiving this drought relief so that everyone in this Parliament will be able to see who the recipients are.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have had problems in this regard before. I will mention one man who was mentioned by Senator Walsh yesterday as a person who may well be in receipt of drought relief. This is a matter which Senator Walsh raised before an Estimates committee. I was there. That person is none other than Harry M. Miller, a gaolbird who got away with taxpayers' money. He might well find himself in the position of benefiting from this legislation. Of course, whenever we asked many questions about this person who had offices of patronage under this Government we were told that Harry M. Miller was serving in a voluntary capacity. After many weeks of hard grind in here we found out that, whilst he might not have been getting a salary, he was getting a lot of perks on the side, such as free telephones, free trips overseas and so on-all at the taxpayers' expense. These are things that honourable senators on this side of the House are concerned about. That is one of the reasons why this amendment has been moved. There ought to be some ceiling. There also ought to be a register so that we will know who is getting the money.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to see the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in charge of this Bill. His office puts out in June of every year a document which shows how many people are in receipt of a pension, whether it be an age, or widows pension, or supporting mothers benefit or unemployment benefit. That is all listed under the postcode areas. If that can be done by the Department of Social Security, with the hundreds of thousands of people involved, there is no reason why a similar register or publication could not be made available to the Parliament showing how many people in each postcode area are in receipt of money under this scheme and the amounts of money involved. There might be some reason of confidentiality or embarrassment as to why the names should not be in the documents. But at least responsible people on this side of the House-say, the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) or the shadow Minister for Primary Industry-ought to have access to those names on a confidential basis to see that the scheme is operating above board and that everyone is getting a fair go.

        I refer again to the statement made by Senator Carrick that we on this side of the House are always trying to have a shot at primary producers. I say again, as I have said many other times, that in my State of South Australia two country seats are held by Government members. They are the seats of Wakefield and Barker . They are so concerned about the interests of primary producers and country people that they do not even live in their electorates. They do not even have an office in their electorates. They have decided to live in the metropolitan area, within sight of the Adelaide Town Hall clock, and to have their offices in King William Street. So again I say that we on this side of the House have given conclusive proof by supporting legislation to assist farmers and by our members living in country areas.

        My colleague Laurie Wallis, the honourable member for Grey, has two offices, one at Port Augusta and the other, following a recent decision by the Government to give him another office because he represents about 92 per cent of the area of South Australia, at Whyalla. I am the only senator in South Australia who lives and has an office in the country. I have two offices. The office at Mount Gambier is at my own expense. So the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Members of the Labor Party are concerned about country people and farmers. We proved that by our actions not only by way of legislation but also by where we domicile ourselves to try to give service to these people.

        The Labor Party has a drought policy. Although the Labor Party has been criticised, there is no justification for that criticism. I just want to read to the Senate part of our drought policy. We say in the preamble to this policy:

        Drought is a frequently recurring problem for Australian agriculture. Yet it often seems to catch governments by surprise.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think Senator Macklin said during the debate last night that there have been about 22 droughts in this century. I will have to have a look at those figures to see whether they are correct. I am using his words; I hope I am quoting him correctly. In any case, droughts are nothing new in Australia. Therefore all governments, both State and Federal, should be aware at all times that a drought is around the corner. They should not have to make, as in this instance, a hasty decision, as we were told during an Estimates committee hearing, at the whim of the Federal Government. We were told that there were no rules and regulations when the Government suddenly decided that it would make this money available. I can just imagine the problems that the people working in the Department of Primary Industry had in trying to draw up some rules and regulations to administer this piece of legislation.

       <para>
        The ALP's drought policy aims to put an end to the ad hoc approach to drought relief which has characterised the response of the Liberal-National Party Government. This is an ad hoc response in terms of the way that this piece of legislation came so hurriedly into the Parliament. Labor's drought policy reads:

       <para>
        At the farm level the ALP's policy is designed to encourage producers to protect themselves against the adverse consequences of drought.

        In the event of severe, sustained drought, primary producers will be provided with income support so that the farm family and farm business can be maintained, and valuable resources not lost to agriculture.
       </para>
       <para>
        Great emphasis is placed on that part of our drought relief policy on the farm and the farming family. They are the people about whom we are concerned because they are the backbone of the country areas. The practical farmers who live in country areas buy their goods in country towns and also employ local labour. This is something about which we are very concerned. We will be taking further steps after the next election to bring about a better method of implementing drought relief when such a step is necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am also concerned that every time honourable senators opposite get up and talk about legislation they are prone to refer to those on this side of the House as 'you socialists'. There is no bigger offender in this respect that Senator Lajovic. He says we are socialists. I would say that this is a very good piece of socialist legislation. It is real socialist legislation under which the taxpayers of this country are providing finance to help people in need. That is what socialism is all about. I am very surprised that Senator Lajovic's name was not on the speakers list because I would have thought that he would have been here espousing his views as an anti-socialist and saying that the Government should not be making available the money that is embodied in this piece of legislation and perhaps the extra money which will be required to increase the amount to $600m. But he is very silent on that. Of course, he and most National Party people and many of the Liberals who have country seats have a philosophy, which Senator Webster espoused in this place on many occasions; they capitalise their profits and socialise their losses. That is the philosophy of these people .
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, we have no objection to using taxpayers' money to help people in need. But let us be fair about it. Government members should not come in here and criticise Labor Party members because of our socialist policies. As we have said on many occasions, those policies are designed to help people in need. The strong have to help the weak. Honourable senators on the opposite side are always prepared to engage in legislation of this sort when they can see some benefit for themselves. However, if we support other legislation in which there is some benefit for the working man, we are criticised as being socialists, as helping bludgers. That is not the case at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to take up the time of the Senate. The Labor Party is not opposed to this legislation. Government senators have inferred, but have not actually said, that we are opposed to the legislation. We support it. However, in supporting it we have taken the opportunity to move an amendment which in my view and in the view of my party, as I said in my opening remarks, is necessary to ensure that people will not be able to take unfair advantage of the money that is made available. I hope that the Government will take on board what I have said about compiling a register. From looking at the sky every morning when I get up, I think that the drought is still going to be with us when we come into government next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this Government does not act, I will be moving very strongly to see that a register of recipients is set up, as happened when we were in government and Senator Murphy, as the Minister for Customs and Excise, used the powers that were available to him to have compiled a register of recipients of superphosphate bounty payments. Of course, we found that people opposite fought tooth and nail to ensure that those names were not publicised. I think it took me three days to get the list that was available to us put on the public record. Many people were surprised when they found who was on the list. We were not supplied with the total amount that people received. However, we found that the now Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, was a recipient of some $5,000 from the superphosphate bounty. It is no wonder that members of the Liberal-National Party Government wanted to hide this information. Many members of the Cabinet of this Government are primary producers. We have only to look around at how they hold out both of their hands if there are any perks about. We have only to have a look at Mr Anthony getting a home loan at 4 3/4 per cent and-a lot of people were not aware of this-letting the home out to a member of the Central Intelligence Agency at probably an enormous rent. That is something that we will be pursuing at some later date. We want to see whether in fact he declared as income the rent he received on a house which he purchased with a cheap home loan .
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, let it not ever be said again that we on this side of the House are opposed to giving assistance to the farming community or, for that matter, people who live in country towns. That is one of the main planks of our platform . We realise that no one side of the community can exist without the other. If the enterprises of farmers of this country are not profitable they will not buy the goods which are manufactured by the workers on the assembly lines. Likewise, if the workers do not have an income and are short of cash thay cannot buy the produce that the farmers grow. So each side depends on the other. Whilst we have a lot of criticism of this Bill and the way in which it is being implemented in such an ad hoc and hasty fashion, we will support it. We hope that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber will support the amendment that has been moved by my colleague, Senator Walsh.

         —I thank Senator Scott for his support of the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill and in particular for bringing out a point which I am surprised needed bringing out and which in light of the debate clearly had not really come to the attention of some members of the Opposition. Senator Scott laid very heavy stress on the severity of the drought conditions facing most of Australia, in particular the eastern two-thirds of Australia, and the fact that that introduces considerations which are not normally the concern of government in a more limited drought. The extensive nature of this drought means, as Senator Scott pointed out, that there are few alternatives available for farmers. There is little agistment available. Farmers are in such a position that their stock will be difficult to sell. There is nowhere else to send them and the only option is either to destroy them or to purchase feed. So it is the severity of this drought which had led the Government to introduce these special measures which stand as a supplement over and above the normal provisions which are allowed for under the general natural disasters relief scheme which applies throughout Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is in that context that I want to be very critical of some of the points made by Senator Walsh in his attack on the legislation. As I understand it, all parties in the Senate are supporting the passage of this Bill. The complaints were in the nature of complaints that in detail the Bill is deficient or that it lacks sufficient detail. Senator Walsh was at pains to point out that there could be opportunities for very considerable benefit to well off people under this legislation. I think the points he made and the examples he raised ignore part of the realities of drought Australia 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will pick up one of those examples. Senator Walsh referred to a farmer with a mortgage of $1m, carrying interest at 16 per cent, and 20,000 sheep for whom a fodder subsidy would be sought. Senator Walsh picked out that very atypical example. I think there would be general agreement in the Senate that very few farmers would carry that sort of debt. The average level of debt that I have seen in the papers supporting this legislation is about $32,000. A $1m debt is a very atypical example. Let us assume that there is a very small number of people in drought affected Australia who are capable of carrying that sort of debt. Senator Walsh pointed out that such a person, paying 16 per cent on a mortgage of $1m, would be obtaining an interest subsidy of $3,333 per month and a fodder subsidy of $16,000 per month. A fodder subsidy on 20,000 sheep at a maximum of 80 cents per sheep comes to $16,000. One gets the picture of a person with very substantial assets-and they are very substantial debts, one would have to say- getting a subsidy of up to $20,000 per month or close to $250,000 per year.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to note that even in that extreme and unusual example, assistance will be provided by the Government-that, of course, means by the people of Australia-in circumstances when, although the farmer might be receiving an interest subsidy of $3,333, at the same time he is liable for an interest payment of $10,000 per month. He is receiving merely the top 4 per cent of his interest. He is liable for the remaining 12 per cent. He will qualify for that interest subsidy only if he has liquid assets of no more than that amount of 12 per cent. In other words, he is required to denude himself of available liquid assets. That means shares and all of the things which can readily be turned into cash. He is incurring personal liability month by month at a rate of $10,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fodder subsidy is, of course, a subsidy which at maximum provides 50 per cent of what is required for the purchase of fodder. That is the maximum rate of subsidy that can be provided. So, if the drought relief program is providing $16 ,000 per month, by definition, the farmer himself is providing $16,000 per month or more. His liability, therefore, in this drought situation where, by definition, he is eligible for the interest subsidy only if he has restricted liquid assets on which he can draw, is a commitment of $26,000 per month. That figure is, of course, very considerably in excess of the amount of subsidy he is receiving. That sort of extreme example is put forward by Senator Walsh to incite envy and cause division when we, as a country, ought to be showing a bit of unity and attempting to pull together. A considerable subsidy could be available in that very odd and unusual example when the farmer is subject to quite enormous outgoings-in this case well over $300,000 per year-which are in excess of the liquid assets to which he has access. I stress two things: The very unusual nature of the example that Senator Walsh chose to draw on and the fact that his example did not bring out the fact that that farmer would not merely receive a subsidy; he would have to eat into his remaining assets to a very considerable extent during the period of the drought. I stress that if a farmer with very large assets had liquid assets in excess of the interest requirement of 12 per cent, he would not qualify for the whole or part of the interest rate subsidy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another point of division in the debate was the question which was raised both by Labor speakers and the speaker on behalf of the Australian Democrats about the failure of the legislation to assist wheatgrowers. I stress that the assistance which is provided under the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill is, for a start, supplementary to general drought assistance measures which are, of course, available to wheatgrowers as they are to other farmers. The only new measure which is not available to wheatgrowers is the fodder subsidy. In fact many wheatgrowers own sheep or cattle which they run in conjunction with their wheat properties. Practice does vary from region to region in Australia. The interest rate subsidy is available to grain farmers. For those who run both grain and stock of course the fodder subsidy is also available. Wheatgrowers have access to all other assistance which is provided including, as I said before, the interest rate subsidy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The precise provisions which might apply to grain growers vary from State to State. In New South Wales there is also a special cereal growers advance under the Commonwealth-State arrangements which helps a farmer to plant his next wheat crop. New South Wales is the premier or leading wheat State, although this year I think my State of Western Australia, thanks to the good fortune of good weather, carries that crown. But New South Wales is the major wheat State and the most drought affected. That is a very relevant provision to wheatgrowers in that area. In my State of Western Australia which happily has just come out of a long period of drought, special provisions for carry on finance were made with respect to the grain growing areas which were particularly hard hit. I mention the northern wheatbelt in Western Australia as an area which has suffered very substantial hardship over a four-year period.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concern expressed by Senator Macklin about there being no national drought insurance plan in a country where there is drought in some part of it in 78 out of 100 years is understandable but it appears to ignore the fact that regular drought assistance programs are available. I have already mentioned the natural disasters scheme in which the Commonwealth participates with the States on a three for one basis after the States have undertaken initial expenditure up to a limit which varies according to the size of the State. It is simply not true to suggest that there is no regular procedure for dealing with drought in Australia . Another aspect of the matter is that the Commonwealth has encouraged drought proofing measures through the tax system. Considerable tax advantages are available for primary producers who choose to improve the water supply, and so on, on their properties as a drought proofing measure. In response to Senator Macklin I simply say that, whilst no government would wish to put out of its mind the possibility of improvement in the way that it deals with drought, it is a fact that we have had for some years measures which farmers know will be brought into action in the event of significant drought.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator McLaren raised an issue which at first I thought involved his wanting to have produced some form of McCabe-Lafranchi report on drought relief which would give him a great list of names which he could peruse to his heart's content. Subsequently, it became clearer from his comments that he was looking for rather more limited advice. There would be little difficulty in producing broad district statistics of the kind that the honourable senator suggested ought to be generally available. I have not had a chance to take advice on the matter but, when public moneys are used for any public purpose, it is usual for statistics to be made available as to where that money has gone. In a broad sense, reference has been made to my own Department and to its ability to produce details of expenditure according to postcode areas. I am not in a position to guarantee that one could provide that sort of detail but I will certainly ask the Department of Primary Industry and the Minister to take note of the request. I believe that the nation and the Parliament would be interested to learn in which areas expenditure was being incurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of names being available, on any basis, I would be less positive in my response. There again, I will take the matter on notice and refer it to the Minister for consideration. I understand that Senator McLaren is seeking a much more limited exposure, if I may use that term, than his opening remarks conveyed to me.
       </para>
       <para>
        My only other general comment concerns the point made by Senator Walsh, that if we were to have drought assistance measures of this type we might be moving to a situation in which a farmer could say: 'I should never put myself in a position in which I have cash or fodder reserves and should never utilise income equalisation deposits because if I fail to do all these things I will be more eligible for the sort of assistance that is provided under this scheme'. I do not deny that there is some logic in the point that the drought relief measures proposed are to be available generally to people who are without other liquid resources. But I point out again that the Government's proposals are made in the context of an unusually bad and general drought situation across virtually the whole of agricultural Australia other than, I would have thought, Gippsland and Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thus, we are in an unusual situation in which the Government sees it as quite important to ensure that there is no requirement that people walk off properties on a wholesale basis, or destock on a wholesale basis. We face an unusually difficult situation. To impose on the assistance provided a limit based on some measure of prudence to be judged by the public servants who have to administer the measure might well leave us in the situation of providing assistance for those who have been prudent and denying it to those who are perhaps on marginal land or, alternatively, have managed their affairs less well, so that such people would be forced to lose their property or significantly destock them. They are circumstances such as the Government believes should be avoided. I should have thought that it would be fairly clear that in farming in Australia generally one could not rely upon similarly generous measures being brought down by the Government when less severe drought conditions were generally evident around the country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer now to a matter that has been raised by way of inquiry but has not been aired in debate. A number of farmers have made representations, I believe through Senator Hill, about the exclusions which relate to the offsets against subsidy entitlement when farmers are sellers of fodder as well as purchasers. The rationale underlying the exclusions laid down is that the Government does not consider taxpayers' funds should be used to subsidise fodder purchases at the same time as farmers are selling fodder. However, in the case of the exclusions, it is considered that the product of a grain producing enterprise on a farm is not, in normal circumstances, used or sold for stock feed. Such grains are used for either human consumption or, in the case of seed, for replanting. It would be inconsistent with the general approach and philosophy adopted to require that revenue from these sales be deducted from subsidy entitlements when fodder is purchased. For example, if a farmer owns wheat of a grade lower than GP, it is demonstrably wheat which could only be used for feeding. Consequently disposing of it would represent a fodder sale and it is only correct that such revenue should be offset against any subsidy entitlement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment proposed by the Opposition, which the Government opposes, raises a series of matters. It is what we may term a pious amendment. An attempt is not being made to deny the Bill a second reading but rather to express views of the Senate concerning it. The views laid down in the amendment that has been moved by Senator Walsh are threefold: Firstly, that a limit should be set on the sum that any individual may receive in any one year; secondly, that eligibility should be determined by placing a ceiling on total assets instead of the proposed liquidity test; and, thirdly, that those who are predominatly dependent on their farms for a living should be objectively defined.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I may comment on the proposed amendment, it is true that neither the interest subsidy scheme nor the fodder subsidy scheme are subject to an absolute upper limit. However, in a practical sense both have limits. I touched on one of these in my remarks earlier. The fodder subsidy is restricted to $8 per month per head of cattle and 80c per month per head of sheep. This is quite clearly a limit that is related to the number of stock being carried by the farmer. If one placed an absolute limit on the subsidy, regardless of the number of stock carried, it would defeat the purpose of th scheme. If the purpose is to avoid destocking, those with large flocks or herds would not be eligible for the subsidy and may well have to destock. The purpose of maintaining our flocks and herds, particularly of breeding stock, is one with which there is no quarrel, although the Opposition says that it should be restricted to breeding stock. But what the Opposition's amendment is really saying is that we should retain the stock that happen to be in small herds and flocks but not that which happens to be in larger herds and flocks. Alternatively, the Opposition is saying that, by definition, those who have larger herds have the resources to maintain them- which is not, in my view, a self-evident truth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The interest rate subsidy applies only to farm debt before 31 August 1982 or to carry-on loans obtained after that date. The size of the farm enterprise itself determines, in practical terms, the maximum amount of interest that a farm operator could be required to pay and, accordingly, the maximum amount of subsidy that the Government could be required to meet. Earlier I made the point that when a person is receiving an interest rate subsidy of, say, 4 per cent as in the example that Senator Walsh gave, that person is himself directly responsible for the initial 12 per cent of interest. The size of a primary producer's problem, as far as debt is concerned, is often related to the size of his enterprise and the Government's concern is to prevent viable farmers being forced off their properties. In that sense, the size of the operation is irrelevant. Therefore, the Government opposes that part of the proposed amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second proposal is that eligibility should be determined by placing a ceiling on total assets instead of imposing the proposed liquidity test. If I may be brief, where the objective of the exercise is to prevent the need for properties to be disposed of in drought circumstances, clearly, if one requires a farmer to exhaust or dispose of other than readily realisable financial assets , the objectives will not be met. The subsidy applies only in the case in which the 12 per cent interest payment, which is the responsibility of the farmer, is available from his readily realisable financial assets. So, in the view of the Government, the ceiling imposed is appropriate, given the desire to avoid the need for people to leave their properties because of this very severe and, we hope, unusual drought.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for the proposal that those who are predominantly dependent on their farms for their living should be objectively defined, there is no problem in defining who is eligible for the fodder subsidy. Of course, any person who has purchased fodder for feeding to drought affected sheep or cattle which he owns is eligible to make a claim.
       </para>
       <para>
        The philosophy of the interest subsidy scheme, as I said earlier, is to assist full time farmers to stay on their properties during a drought. Consequently, one of the eligibility conditions will be that a farm enterprise must have at least one person dependent on that farm's income for his or her livelhood. That is the judgment which will have to be made by those administering the scheme but it is not expected to create any great difficulty. It is the view of the Government that an objective definition is unworkable because the combination of circumstances is so wide as to almost certainly ensure that any tight definition would exclude some of those needing and deserving help and include others in another category. There is an element of discretion here which the Government believes it is not possible to avoid. I am grateful that the Senate supports the legislation in the broad. I regret that it is seen as defective in some respects by the Opposition. I take it from the speeches which have been made that there will be no desire on the part of the Senate to deny the Bill passage today.

As I recall, we redivided on that basis. He was the yachtsman from Launceston, former Senator Devitt. That is my recollection. It occurred some years ago. In the light of that explanation, I wonder whether, by the leave of the Senate, the record of the division-it would be irrelevant to the result-might be amended to show Senator Walters as voting on the side of the noes.

         —I wish to make a few remarks on clause 5 of the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill 1982 which authorises the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to make agreements with the States. I think the comments will be appropriate. We do not yet know what type of agreement the Minister will make. I criticised the Bill at the second reading stage for that reason. It is customary, in circumstances such as this, to append to the Bill a schedule which lays down, at least in broad terms, the conditions of the agreement that will be made. That has not been done in this case for reasons that I made clear last night.

        I have considerable sympathy for the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) for being sent in here on behalf of the Government to defend the indefensible. Under those circumstances, it is not surprising that he resorted to spurious or specious arguments. I will cite just one example of such an argument. Senator Chaney gave an excuse for imposing a liquidity test on eligibility, instead of an asset test. He stated that it was necessary to apply a liquidity test because, if an asset test were applied, people would be forced off farms, forced to slaughter all their stock, which would result in a substantial portion of the national breeding herd being destroyed, and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us consider the situation of someone who owns a farm worth $1m or $5m-the same conditions still apply. Providing he has no cash, Senator Chaney has actually suggested that the alternatives facing such a farmer are either to receive the subsidy from the Government or to walk off the farm and destroy the animals. Really, what are banks for? A person who is without cash but who has very substantial collateral can borrow from a bank. A person who is already heavily indebted-particularly as banks might take a more pessimistic view of what collateral and equity a would-be borrower has in time of drought-qualifies for special finance anyway under pre-existing joint Commonwealth-State arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chaney also said in defence of this extraordinary measure-I do not think he actually put a time frame on it but he implied it-that it was a once in 30 years drought, a once in a lifetime drought, or something of that order, and that everybody knows that it will not be repeated every time there is a drought somewhere. I can tell Senator Chaney of one person who does not know that and that is the Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia, who was quoted in the Press last week as asserting-not just saying that he hoped it would happen, but asserting-that this is what would happen. Mr Old said that this is the ground rule for the future; that the next time there is a drought in Western Australia the Western Australian farmers will get the same conditions, will receive assistance identical to that now being provided in the eastern States. So certainly everybody does not know that it is a one-off, once in a lifetime, situation. I will certainly ensure that Mr Old and other people in Western Australia are aware that they have now been told by Senator Chaney, on behalf of the Government, that the next time there is a drought in Western Australia, say of the type there was in 1980, assistance identical to this certainly will not be made available.

         —I withdraw, Mr Chairman. The ludicrous suggestion or demand that came from Mr Nixon that a $3 per head subsidy be paid to farmers who destroy their sheep was followed by a great deal of criticism from Mr Nixon of the New South Wales and Victorian governments for not going along with such a silly idea . Senator Scott attempted to defend the proposal on the most extraordinary grounds. He said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At least with a $3 slaughter subsidy there will be a base in the market-place and a stop to any form of needless slaughter.

       <para>
        It is extraordinary to suggest that if we pay somebody $3 to destroy a sheep he will be less likely to destroy it than if he is not paid $3 to do it. The structure of incentives that is supposed to govern a market economy has just been stood on its head by Senator Scott. I am not particularly surprised that that sort of illogical reasoning or divorcement from reality is a popular view, or at least a view that exists, in the National Party. However, it is much more serious and much more alarming when views marginally less irrational than that are reflected in legislation, as they are reflected in this legislation.

I did meet one cynic who said that banks are there mainly to lend you money when you do not need it and send you to a finance company when you do. I do not adopt that attitude. The question of the availability of finance when one is in severe financial difficulty is one which I know has been addressed by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) who, in a recent release, has indicated that in the past the banks have been prepared to look at the interests of the rural community in these circumstances and expressed either the hope or the confident expectation that they would on this occasion.

        As far as assistance to Western Australia is concerned, recently I looked at the measures of drought relief extended to Western Australia during a period of what was very significant drought in that State. In some of the grain producing areas there were farmers who did not get a crop for four consecutive years and, bearing in mind the cost of sowing, that is a very significant and severe situation. I cannot recall precisely all of the measures which were extended with respect to drought relief in Western Australia during that period but I can at least remind the Senate of the fact that carry-on finance and the limits to carry-on finance were increased significantly as that drought continued over a period of years. In other words there was then, as there is now, a preparedness on the part of the Government to respond flexibly and to introduce measures which are not standard measures. I made the comment in the response to the second reading debate that we do have a national system for dealing with drought relief. It is principally within the bounds of the policies which we have with respect to natural disasters. We accept that the States substantially administer drought relief measures. We stand, as the Commonwealth, prepared to contribute on a regular three for one basis once the States have made their own preliminary contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Western Australia had a severe drought. It was not part of a nation-wide drought. Measures were taken to respond to the particular difficulties which were faced in my State of Western Australia at that time. I have put the view that the measures which have been introduced this year in a case of drought across most of the pastoral and agricultural areas of Australia have been introduced to meet the particular needs of 1982 and that these are not measures which are put forward as standard drought relief measures for every drought circumstance which might arise in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think there is anything further on which I wish to comment. I do not wish to recanvass the limits which exist for the provision of assistance with respect to both the interest rate subsidy and the fodder subsidy. The interest rate subsidy is one which is geared to picking up a part only, that part in excess of 12 per cent, of debt related to the farming activity in circumstances in which there are limited liquid assets available to the farmer. The fodder subsidy has its own inbuilt monthly limit per head of stock. This represents the maximum that any farmer can seek and obtain.

         —I will not take the time of the chamber for very long. Firstly, I should like to thank Senator Chaney for the way in which he responded to my proposal that a register should be kept of recipients of drought relief. I think he said in reply that there might be some difficulty in breaking down such a register into postcode areas. I would not think that would create a great difficulty. It we can get it down into regions, it is not a very great step from there to getting it into postcode areas. This is a matter which has been brought to my attention by people in drought areas, not in this drought but at other times of drought, when drought relief has been administered by the States. People have come to me wanting to know why certain other people have been the recipients of certain drought relief. I was not able to tell them whether the people mentioned got drought relief or not. It might be that some recipient or non-recipient has been bragging about the amount of relief he got and this has created a certain amount of jealousy in a person who really needs relief and for some reason or other did not qualify and did not get it. So if we are able to have the register kept, I think it would be of assistance. My suggestion was that the names be made available, if need be to either the shadow Minister for Primary Industry or the Leader of the Opposition in either House on a confidential basis, to overcome the problem. It would probably save a lot of heartburning for many farmers who have complained to me-I might say that there have been more than one-and who are in desperate straits. They may be told by some of their neighbours that they in fact are getting X amount of dollars in drought relief when the people who see me have found it very difficult to get any assistance at all. I look forward to Senator Chaney's proposal going forward to the responsible Minister. We will see what happens in the future. I hope that we do not have to take any action to have that information made available to us.

         —The package of Bills now being debated gives effect to the diesel fuel rebate arrangements that were outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Budget in August. Under the old system, nearly all of the distillate consumed for other than road transport purposes was exempt from the excise by way of a certificate of exemption. The new arrangements ensure that the purchaser will pay the excise at the time of buying the fuel and a number of eligible purchasers will subsequently have that excise refunded to them when they complete the required forms and clerical work. All diesel fuel sold since 17 August has had the excise to all consumers added to it. An amendment was made by the Government in the House of Representatives to enable faster lodgment and processing of the claims for rebate and, more importantly, to allow the rebate to be paid after the fuel is purchased but before it is actually used, whereas the original Bill required that the fuel be consumed before the purchaser became eligible for the rebate. Some other amendments were made to expedite the processing and lodgment of claims by small users.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The major categories of off-road users who are eligible for the new exemption arrangements are in the industries of mining, agriculture, forestry and fishing, and in a few other areas such as domestic hospitals, aged persons homes and nursing homes. There was another amendment added to the Bill in the House of Representatives to provide a rebate for sawmills. It is estimated that a total of $112m per year will be claimed under the rebate arrangements.

        I notice that Senator Scott, who spoke on the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill, is not to speak on this one. For many years it has been the custom of the National Party to take the credit for everything popular in the countryside which coalition governments introduced-which, I suppose, Senator Scott was doing last night-and then to leave the Liberals to carry the can when they introduce something that is not popular, such as this Bill. To be fair, I do note that Senator Collard is listed to speak on this matter later on. Senator Thomas is also on the list to speak. But I am interested to hear what Senator Collard will have to say. The point I was making was that Senator Scott apparently represents the old Country Party style-let the Liberals carry the can for everything that is unpopular and take all the credit for everything that is popular. I am happy to note that Senator Collard, at least to some extent, has changed that rule.

This report had its genesis in the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which now seems to be a long time ago. The Review of Commonwealth Functions mentioned that shopping hours should be deregulated. Subsequently legislation-which became the Commonwealth Functions ( Statutes Review) Act of 1981-was brought before the Senate to bring that deregulation into being. It is worth while reporting that at the time that legislation was brought forward the new senators elected at the 1980 election had not taken their places. So, although the electorate had given an indication that it wanted the composition of this place to be changed, the Government took the opportunity while it still had a majority to pass that legislation. Section 90 of the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act repealed the Trading Hours Ordinance of 1962. After the legislation was passed the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory inquired into trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory. The terms of reference given to the Committee were:

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Committee is asked to consider and report on:
       </para>
       <para>
        'The manner in which deregulation of retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory pursuant to Section 90 of the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981, might be implemented having regard to the effect on retailers, employees and consumers'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress the words 'might be implemented'. The Committee did not have to consider that it would be implemented; it had to inquire into how it might be implemented. After the Committee was given its terms of reference it carried out an extensive inquiry. Public hearings were held in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and the Committee also travelled to the Northern Territory to examine retail trading in Alice Springs and Darwin. The Committee went to the two latter places because of the peculiar situation pertaining to them in that they allow trading to be almost deregulated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I dissented from the majority decision outlined in the Committee's report. My dissent was the same as that of Mrs Kelly and Mr Fry, members of the House of Representatives. In particular, we dissented from paragraph 225 of the Committee 's majority report. That paragraph states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Committee recommends that:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) the present Trading Hours Ordinance 1962 be repealed and replaced by an alternative ordinance.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) a new Trading Hours Ordinance be drafted to include the following provisions:
       </para>
       <para>
        The sale of all goods in the ACT be permitted at any time except that a major retailer may not open for business between midnight Saturday and midnight Sunday .
       </para>
       <para>
        A major retailer is defined as a retailer employing more than 100 people in the ACT or elsewhere in Australia in any number of shops.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those of us who submitted the dissenting report believe that the evidence presented to the Committee is contrary to the recommendations in paragraph 225 of the report. In fact, in our dissenting report we said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence did not establish any demand for changing the present Ordinance; rather it overwhelmingly opposed deregulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We went on to outline the extent of opposition to deregulation. In paragraph 2 of the dissenting report we said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Approximately 4000 shoppers, 200 small traders, the Australian Association of Independent Businesses and the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Union wrote to the Committee to register their total opposition to deregulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As well as that, we pointed out in our minority report that there was no demand in the evidence for change. We said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In contrast with the strong opposition to deregulation, there has been no public demand for a change in Canberra's trading hours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those who submitted the dissenting report were concerned about price increases which might take effect if deregulation took place. It is pertinent that I quote from paragraph 8 of the dissenting report because it is important to all consumers in the Australian Capital Territory. We said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We consider that the evidence indicated that the cost of goods to consumers will rise if trading hours are extended. David Jones provided evidence that Saturday afternoon trading would result in an increase in the price of goods of around 1.5%. Waltons has calculated a 13.3% increase in payroll costs associated with Saturday afternoon trading. Such an increase would put pressure on prices. As well, small traders argued strongly that increased overheads as a result of increased trading hours would inevitably result in higher prices to consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        We could see no evidence that enabled the Committee to conclude that increased sales would offset these increased costs. I refer honourable senators to paragraph 9 of the dissenting report which takes that point to greater length. I refer also to paragraph 12, in which Mrs Kelly, Mr Fry and I point out the social effects of deregulation in Canberra. We said that deregulation would:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) reduce opportunities for full-time employment;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) increase the price of goods to the consumer;
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) seriously disadvantage and threaten the viability of small traders; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) cause disruption to family life of employees and reduce opportunities for sporting and religious pastimes on weekends.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could expand on those at great length but unfortunately, although we were told when the tradng hours inquiry started that we would be allowed in this place to have a full debate-we were given that assurance by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner-we now have only 10 minutes each to speak to this report. Therefore, in conclusion I would like to say something about the dissenting report submitted by my colleague, Senator Georges. I do have some sympathy with one of the recommendations in his dissenting report. In paragraph 1 (b) he says:
       </para>
       <para>
        the present trading Hours Ordinance is to be gradually re-enforced and that sufficient resources be made available for this purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although I have sympathy for the remarks of Senator Georges, a pattern of retailing has been established in the Australian Capital Territory due to a lack of enforcement by the Department of the Capital Territory and, in my view, and I am sure in the view of my two fellow dissenters, it would create hardship to revert to what should have been enforced. In view of my dissenting report, I now move:
       </para>
       <para>
        At end of motion add:
       </para>
       <para>
        ', but the Senate agrees with the views and the conclusions expressed in the Dissenting Report by Mrs R. J. Kelly, MP, Mr K. L. Fry, MP and Senator Colston'.

         —I understand that an arrangement has been made-it is satisfactory to me-that honourable senators will be allowed 10 minutes in which to speak on these issues. This is due to the pressure of Government business. I make the point that the Government, through the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), gave an undertaking not to do anything before full debate takes place on the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. That being so, I expect that nothing adverse to the current situation will be done. The Minister can take a course of action which is in support of the current situation, of course, but he should not do anything that would be considered adverse to it until we complete our debate next week. I hope that the Minister will do what is suggested in this report; that is, refer the matter to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly- and will go further and, as has been suggested in one of the minority reports, reinforce the current ordinance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on the tenure of academics was put down in the Senate on 9 September. Because we have had Estimates committees to attend and a variety of other activities to perform on Thursdays this is the first opportunity that a member of the Australian Labor Party has had to respond to the report and to highlight what we regard as important in it. I think that the initial reason for the inquiry into the tenure of academics came from a belief that many young potential academics had no future at all. Very few job opportunities are available for young people seeking a career of an academic nature. It was claimed that that was partly due to having tenure for academic positions, that such tenure blocks out younger people because, with tenure, people can continue in employment until they are 60 or 65 years of age.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think that the main conclusion in the Committee's report on tenure is that tenure is not the reason at all for the blockage for young academics. In the 1960s and the 1970s we saw a very rapid expansion in higher education not only in universities but also in colleges. That expansion has come to a halt. There is stagnation now in those areas. Therefore, there are no opportunities for many potential staff members. There are several reasons for this lack of opportunity. I believe the first is that there is a very low turnover in academic staff. Most people who become academics like the lifestyle; they are committed to that lifestyle and do not leave it readily. Whereas one might expect a turnover of 10 or 15 per cent in certain occupations, the tendency is for it to be 5 per cent or lower in institutions of higher education.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second reason there is not that sort of expansion any more is simply that the Government has embarked on a program of financial stringency. The higher education areas have suffered fairly drastically because of that. I am not saying that in all cases financial stringency was not warranted; nevertheless, it has contributed to very few increases being made in staff. I will not explore what that has meant to the community as a whole-it has limited higher education to 10 per cent of the total youth of this country-as it would be more appropriate to do that at another time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the recommendations in the report. The Committee recommended that there be continual review procedures. We recommend two types of procedures: Firstly, that an academic's performance be monitored after a year, mainly to see whether that academic is performing as the institution requires. There is no doubt that it would be envisaged that at the start of the year the duties of an academic would be outlined by the head of the department or the professor concerned and that at the end of the year there would be some monitoring to see whether that academic had performed as required. The second procedure we recommended was that there be a seven-year review of academic performance. One of the criticisms that the Committee received, I think, was that once an academic got a job he was basically there for life and there was no review of his position. In virtually no other area of employment in Australia is there no review. Therefore, we recommended that every seven years some sort of a review occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not suggesting that witch hunts be launched, that people be driven out of their jobs or that they should be persecuted in any way. I think that this is the only recommendation that has received criticism from academics. They are not entirely happy with it, although it appears to me that they are generally happy with the report. The report does support tenure as a concept. It supports that because on all the evidence we heard we were convinced that for the continuation of academic freedom and higher education tenure was an essential aspect. Without tenure we could go to a situation that exists in many of the more totalitarian countries where people are not free to research and teach in the fields in which they want to.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to some of the other points that came out of the report. The first concerns the Academic Salaries Tribunal. At the moment that body exists in Australia but really only has powers over a university in the Australian Capital Territory. All the other universities and colleges use that body as a body which actually makes recommendations. The Tribunal has only those recommendatory powers over salaries. It does not have the power to rule on other industrial conditions. It seems to me, and I think to other members of the Committee, that if we want a rational industrial relations atmosphere in higher education we can achieve it by vesting in the Academic Salaries Tribunal powers over all universities and colleges. We do not recommend that the Commonwealth Government try to impose that. Of necessity, to achieve that end would require negotiation between the States and the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area we would like to emphasise where we found some resistance in certain witnesses is the importance of teaching in higher education. This is especially so in universities where most of the emphasis in terms of promotion and evaluation of an academic's performance tragically has been related to his or her performance in the research area. This is a trend which is changing. In the report, we highlight the fact that teaching has equal importance with research in terms of reviewing how well an academic is performing in any institution. We say that there should be some form of teacher training for academics. We hint that the ability to go out and teach others is not an inherent quality and say that there needs to be a development through in-service and other methods to develop those skills.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main factor that the Committee has tackled in relation to tenure and its related subjects is the need to try to get more flexibility into the system to enable far greater numbers of people to be employed in that area over a period. The first recommendation in that regard relates to superannuation. There are already moves in the direction of setting up a national portable superannuation scheme. The sooner that is done, the quicker we will have far greater flexibility within the higher education area. There are problems inasmuch as some academics are in State schemes. Work needs to be done to ensure that any national scheme equates with those State schemes if people are to move.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area on which we recommend concerns fractional appointments. I think that they will do a lot to increase flexibility. Not every academic wants to work full time. At the moment they do not have the opportunity to accept fractional appointments. The third recommendation is in relation to early retirement. That option should at least be available and if there is proper superannuation that can be encouraged. If young academics are to be brought into higher education, that cannot be done unless more positions are made available by people retiring. Of all the trends we have examined, of all the future age profiles, that is going to be a very difficult aspect in the next 10 or 15 years . If we do not start bringing in young academics now, there will be a crisis in tertiary education where suddenly all those who joined in the 1960s and the 1970s will in a short period be resigning from academia and we will be left with a similar burst of having to get in at that stage replacements who perhaps will not be the very best people.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the other points that the Committee makes is the importance of retraining academics. It is not always possible, given the varied disciplines that exist in higher education, for that to occur easily. But one presumes that, if there were a surplus of history teachers and history academics in this country, there might be some way one could rewire them to go into philosophy or some related subject. That would not be easy. It is hard to take a Latin teacher and make him a maths teacher or anything else. Nevertheless, that sort of retraining should be one of the steps.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, I think the tenure report has come up with a fairly bland set of recommendations. We did not set out to sensationalise the issues involved or to aggravate any particular section in higher education. The one point I would like to make is that the various accusations that were made that a lot of academics are bludgers was not proved to my satisfaction in any form. Certain suggestions were made that many people were time serving in higher education. I did not find evidence of that. I have no doubt there may be one or two but in general the academics have performed in a very capable and dedicated manner. The retention of tenure for them is a condition, almost an industrial condition, that makes that area attractive. The salary ranges in academia do not necessarily match those in the outside community; so a factor such as tenure does a lot to maintain the very best in higher education.

         —In relation to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on tenure, I certainly agree with the latter remarks of Senator Robert Ray that we did not find evidence of the suggestions that he just referred to. I think that is worth recording. The first of the general arrangements for tenure in the report states :
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The arrangements for tenure in universities and colleges of advanced education should ensure that tenure is only granted after exacting and sound appointment and probation procedures have been fully met.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that that point is something that needs to be noted. That is not to say that we found that it had not been; but it needs to be re-stated that tenure is not something that should be taken for granted: It is something that must apply and must be available for the security of academics. It should not, I repeat, be taken for granted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter I wish to refer to in particular is the question of portability of superannuation. To create the security needed to enable or encourage people in academia to shift from one university to another, security in the form of portability of superannuation is required. There is a risk of stifling academic achievement if people feel that once they have gained tenure in a university they need to stay there to secure their future. I think that is a pity and something that is not desirable. It seemed to me, from the whole of the inquiry, that the one element that was of prime importance was to see that those responsible sit down and put as their very highest priority the working out of a superannuation scheme which can be flexible and portable among the various institutions. The technicalities which make that impossible must be ironed out. They can only really be technicalities. With good will, the administrators of the tertiary institutions can find a way around this problem to the benefit of all.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one academic in particular to whom I refer. He is Dr David Cohen who, apparently, is associate professor of education at Macquarie University. The Daily Telegraph of 11 September 1982 stated that he hit back at the review plan that the Committee put up. The Committee recommended that there should be a review of academics who were tenured and that their performance should be monitored by the peer group from time to time. The article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Politicians who want to make university academics go through an annual ' inspection' to keep their jobs, should be subject to the same, says a senior academic.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is Dr Cohen. That, of course, was not the recommendation of this Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to tell Dr Cohen that, although he may be worthy of the greatest respect as a professor of education, it is fairly clear that he knows nothing about politics. If he knew anything about politics, the system of endorsement by one's party and the requirement to face the electorate at all too regular intervals, he would know that the system of inspection that we are suggesting for academics is just not in the same class as we face at very regular intervals . It is the sort of comment-I know it is amusing in that sense-that just is not helpful when it comes to looking at a report like this, which Senator Robert Ray has described as bland, and perhaps it is. I think this report is a responsible review of the tertiary institutions that goes into the matter in depth. I recommend the conclusions that we came to. It does not really add anything to have an academic come out in the Press with a statement as absurd as that. It reflects rather badly on academia and, as I said, I think that is rather a pity.
       </para>
       <para>
        All of the recommendations I support, but the one I have briefly referred to- portability of superannuation-I see as a very significant one that I do recommend to those responsible.

I suppose in some way they feel a certain priority right over their report. I feel that possibly Senator Robert Ray's comments that it is a bland report may be praise. Certainly, I do not think one could find terribly much in it to take great exception to. Indeed I think the way in which it has been received by various bodies, such as the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations and by the various vice- chancellor committees and most of the universities, would suggest that they also do not find terribly much to object to in it. However, I think my disappointment with the report is that the problems that the Committee had to face have in some way been put aside.

        There are very real problems which come through time and again in the Hansard reports of the Committee's discussions about a steady state situation and developing talent to enter universities at a steady rate so we do not have what might be called a bulge occurring at certain stages followed by a dearth of qualified people. What types of arrangements are able to be made so that young academics are able to train in a rigorous atmosphere and in their turn take on a teaching role within a university? That poses very difficult problems and I acknowledge that difficulty.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose I was hoping that the Committee, after all its deliberations, would have been able to come up with a breakthrough suggestion in its report. I do not have one. I think that yet again we will have to wait for that breakthrough suggestion on what is an exceedingly difficult problem confronting our entire tertiary sector. I think that, in a sense, the tenure element of this matter is peripheral. I do not believe that if tenure were not available we would have a much greater turnover than we currently have. I do not believe its removal would solve the problems concerning the younger enthusiastic academics coming along. It would not provide a large number of places through senior academics being moved on because in some way they are unproductive. This sort of thing does not occur in these organisations. It is exceedingly difficult in private enterprise to move the top cookies. Once they get on the boards they stay there. Whether or not they are producing the goods, they certainly produce the reports which say they are producing the goods and there is not much that one can do about it. I do not think this situation applies only to the universities as such. Possibly it is a reflection of institutional arrangements more than anything else. I suppose that in that sense, having read the report, I was disappointed that the Committee was not able to come up with a breakthrough suggestion in that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Committee probably dropped into the too hard basket problems about voluntary retirement and how it might be dealt with. It did not deal with something that one of the people who gave evidence before the Committee talked about; that is, the less effective academic. In fact, Professor Harcourt said that, taken as a whole, blind Freddie could get a job in the 1960s. I do not think that is an accurate statement but I believe that in any organisation there are people whose effectiveness falls off. Unfortunately, I have always felt that the only people who can do a thorough job of getting rid of such academics are the people in the institutions themselves and they are the people who are less capable of doing it.
       </para>
       <para>
        A previous speaker commented that if we were looking at getting rid of the ineffective people in this Parliament the people who work in the Parliament probably would be able to draw up a range of criteria and point the finger at whom it might be best to get rid of. They would probably be more effective than anybody else, particularly if the decisions were not taken on party lines. This is simply because those people know the institution, know how it works and know which people are working effectively within the institution. Likewise, in the case of academia, I think the institution itself would contain the best people to get rid of academics. Therefore, I support the notion of peer assessment. I looked in vain for a reasoned, comprehensive suggestion about how this might be done. Again, I am not suggesting that I know the answer. I know that this is one of the most difficult industrial problems into which one could wander. But it is a problem that at some stage we will have to tackle. Therefore, on that count, I again express my disappointment that the Committee was not able to find a way around this problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        The incremental creep in terms of cost structures was dealt with only in a peripheral way. I suppose it was in fact tangential to the purpose of the Committee and hence the Committee did not take a comprehensive view of it. Therefore, I do not think the Committee can be criticised in any way in this regard. However, I believe that if one looks at the economics of tertiary institutions one will find that this is likely to become one of the most telling problems. Indeed, within the last week the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland, while congratulating the Government for picking up the latest problem in terms of the rise granted by the Academic Salaries Tribunal, said that probably all the Government has managed to do is shift the problem to next year's Budget. At some stage the crunch is going to come. That can be put off by making ad hoc decisions each year, but the incremental creep in terms of cost structures, as the entire academic community gets older, within institutions will necessarily add to costs. We had stability previously because there was a greater turnover and as a result people came in at the bottom rung of a lectureship situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know of one faculty within the University of Queensland that has not appointed a new lecturer, senior lecturer, reader or professor in the last 15 years. That is absolutely amazing. This problem has roots which go a fair way back. If one contemplates that this situation is more widespread than in one or two faculties, one is really confronted with an enormous problem of finding jobs and providing training for these people. Indeed, if one knows the structure of those institutions, one must assume that there must be a dramatic falloff in research activity. This is simply because, although the professors may put their names to a lot of work, the tutors, the post-graduate students and the young lecturers who are trying to get tenure are the ones who do a lot of the scrabbling and the furious paddling under the water. In a sense the research activity, the innovative work, is done between the older experienced people and the younger enthusiastic ones who need to earn a living. If we break that balance we break the institutional methodology of doing research in universities . I believe that this has been broken simply by the economics of what we are now talking about. Unfortunately-this is not a criticism of the Committee-the Committee itself was not able to come up with anything more than suggestions such as 'we should give favourable consideration to' or 'we should look very deeply at' or a range of other propositions.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I think that the Committee has offered one extremely useful and important element in that it came down on the side of tenure in a very firm and definitive way. If we can put aside the fear that that is threatened, we may clear the air enormously. This report may have done a great service in that regard. We can then move on to the other serious problems, having put aside that rather contentious area.

         —in reply-It falls to me as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and the person who tabled the report in the Senate on 9 September to sum up the debate and to make some final comments of my own. About 12 months ago the Senate referred to the Committee this national inquiry into the tenure of employment of academics in Australia's universities and colleges. We conducted the inquiry and a month ago we brought down the report. There has been a degree of public response to the report and we have reflected on that in our remarks here today. Three members of the Committee have brought particular matters to the attention of the Senate with more emphasis. For example, Senator Robert Ray referred to the Academic Salaries Tribunal and Senator Reid referred to superannuation. We could also have referred to important sections of the report, such as women academics and how to ensure that there is greater participation by women in our university and college staffs, and to important but minor matters such as the importance of student opinion and of taking into account, when teaching and other academic matters are being assessed, properly or conducted student surveys and other student opinions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In my mind there are really two themes in this report-renewal and accountability. How are we to ensure by our staff appointment processes and the arrangements for tenure that renewing, lively, creative, innovative and truly worthy academic staff will be engaged in teaching and research in our universities and colleges? To ensure accountability, are we able publicly to give assurances that the academics employed in our universities and colleges are living up to the highest traditions of teaching and research and are accountable to one another as corporate universities or corporate colleges? Insofar as public funds support universities and colleges are they accountable to the public at large?
       </para>
       <para>
        These matters are, I believe, sensitively and soundly dealt with in the report. It is certainly gratifying to the six senators who conducted the report and the staff who assisted us that there has been such an overwhelmingly positive response from all sections of the Australian community. The Australian Vice- Chancellors Committee, the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, the colleges of advanced education principals and their staff and the university governing bodies and senior staff have been amongst those who have written or spoken directly to me as Chairman of the Committee in a very positive way. Some students too have made positive statements to me. Apart from Professor Cohen, whose comments Senator Reid noted had been reported in a Sydney newspaper very briefly and tangentially, the only bodies which have been critical, and then only of some aspects of the report, have been the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations and the Federation of College Academics- understandably so. They always want to shore up in any negotiations or developments what they feel would be best for their members. They have been a little critical on a few matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        We now look to the Australian Government to give a direct response to this report. Normally that would be expected within six months. I urge the Government to respond, if possible before the end of this sitting but only if that gives sufficient time, in the Government's judgment, for public responses to be taken into account by it. The Government should respond very soon. The Committee's direct recommendation is that the Government fully endorse the 39 recommendations which the Committee has arrived at. As a government senator wearing other hats I see no difficulty in the Government endorsing the 39 recommendations because I believe that would give the final seal of support to a report that has been well received by the public and, as has been seen by this debate, in the Senate. With that seal of approval or endorsement it would then be a question of the governing bodies of our 19 universities and our 40 or so colleges, by their own lights and judgments and with their understanding of the report, implementing it in the coming months.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say 'in the coming months' because I believe the recommendations in the report for the most part can be achieved by the middle of the next academic year . There are some bench-marks concerning the proportion of academics who are tenured, tutors and other academic staff that may not be achieved within a year or two, but certainly the trend can be established. The governing councils can determine that the goal of an institution is to reach in a practical way the goals that have been set out in this report. I will not quote letters that I have received as Chairman, many of them addressed to the whole body of the Committee, but phrases such as 'excellent report' and 'sound analysis' have even been a little embarrassing. I believe that the Committee which has built up a sound reputation within Australia for careful and considered reports has reinforced that reputation with this report on tenure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very briefly, there are five matters on which there have been particular comments to which I will respond. Some people have said that we have not allowed sufficient flexibility in universities and colleges having as our bench-mark that no more than 90 per cent of academics should be tenured, the other 10 per cent being on contracts. Some people have urged that this proportion could well have been 85 per cent. I can say only that the Committee has carefully and responsibly urged that the figure of 90 per cent be accepted because we believe it is achievable and realistic. If after a few years the monitoring of the tenure aspect of our acedemic institutions by the CTEC leads us to have a further discussion in the Senate, I am sure we will be quite flexible and open to see whether there is merit in moving towards 85 per cent as an amended bench- mark.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some people felt that the Committee was not firm enough on the question of redundancy because, in our recommendations, we have urged that where there is financial exigency in an institution and if there is not enough money to pay salaries, the first staff to go should be those seen to be most redundant. However, we have not directly recommended that if a tenured staff member seems to be redundant in that the student load in an area has gone down markedly his appointment be terminated on that ground alone. I believe we will again see what case can be made by institutions. We may reconsider that question because certainly we do not want to see staff inactive and not achieving the purpose of their institutions. It seems that my time is up. I can only urge the Commonwealth Government in its response to endorse fully the recommendations of the report.

On that occasion Senator Mulvihill and Senator Siddons sought leave to address themselves to that report. Not wanting to truncate the debate, I suggest to the Senate that it proceed now with the formal adoption of the interim report in view of the fact that on Tuesday of next week the Committee will bring up its final report. That final report will, of course, advert to the matters contained in the interim report. But, more importantly, it will canvass in depth the particular considerations referred to by the Senate in its resolution referring the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 and the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill 1982 to the Committee. I trust that the Senate will not regard my remarks as attempting to truncate this debate in any way.

         —On 26 August, when this report was first introduced, I spoke for two minutes about paragraph 2.23 on page 25, which rather offhandedly discards the abilities of the Sea Harrier. On that day I mentioned that the paragraph talked about range and made the comment that range can be whatever we want it to be, particularly when we are dealing with military aircraft. It depends on the configuration of the aircraft, the ordnance being carried, the drop tanks being carried and whether aerial refuelling is available . I understand that two Sea Harriers which served in the Falkland Islands were replenished at one stage by means of aerial refuelling: Firstly, while being flown from England to the Ascension Islands and, secondly, while being flown from the Ascension Islands to one of the carriers. They arrived, as I understand it, over the Falklands in the middle of an air raid. So merely to say blithely that an aircraft has limited range is a rather too casual attitude to take. As I said, they proved that given the right conditions, with aerial refuelling, they had a far greater range than have a lot of civilian aircraft.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The paragraph is also critical of the aircraft's radar capabilities. I repeat, everybody recognises that it is a pulse radar system, with all the limitations that that involves, but it is the best that the state of the art can offer. Indeed, it proved itself in all-weather operations in the Falklands. Another all too casual comment was that the radar was 'incompatible with modern weapon systems'. Yet, the radar and the Sidewinder missile proved a good combination, as some of the Argentine pilots found out. I have been privileged to have had discussions with one of the pilots involved in that conflict. He said that within 15 seconds he had two Argentine aircraft to his credit. So the radar and missile system of the Sea Harrier proved pretty formidable indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I found very hard to comprehend the statement that the Sea Harrier was 'alleged to have lesser agility than contemporary aircraft'. I have yet to find a more agile aircraft. To my knowledge, no other fixed-wing aircraft can go up or down, backwards, or come to a complete stop in flight, yet that statement is made. The last part of the paragraph states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of the absence of any large-scale demand for the aircraft, although the US Marine Corps remains interested in a ground attack variant, it is unlikely that there will be any significant development of the aircraft in the short-term .
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know where the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence got its evidence. To my knowledge at least 800 Sea Harriers; including both the AV8A and now the AV8B-variants of the original theme-are on the order books; probably more than that are on order. So we are looking at a production run of probably close to 1,000 aircraft, which is a pretty fair run for any sort of aircraft in use today whether it be in regular public tranport work, in the civil mode, or in defence.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for the comment that 'it is unlikely that there will be any significant development of the aircraft in the short term' I understand that the Royal Navy is already planning an improved radar, probably of a pulse Doppler type, with which it will be possible to use AMRAAM-the Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile. This provides a very formidable weapons system indeed. In addition, Rolls-Royce-this information was obtained from discussions with that organisation-is looking at the re-heat possibilities. It has in mind a different type of re-heat-we know it as afterburning-from that used in all other aircraft, in which the afterburning is done in the tail pipe. This will be known as plenum chamber burning. It will use the bypass air from the front nozzles of the Harrier. This means that one begins with a base of very cold air, so the plenum chamber burning will be far more effective than effected by tail pipe afterburning.

        Therefore it worries me to see in a report a paragraph with many glaring inaccuracies. Unfortunately, that calls into question the whole report. Obviously, it is the report of a Joint Committee. I do not believe that a Senate Standing Committee would have permitted such a large number of inaccuracies in one paragraph of a report. The inaccuracies worry me because the standard of the committee work undertaken by the Parliament, particularly that done by the Senate, is generally very high. When such inaccuracies can be pointed out the basis on which the whole report was prepared is called into question. I am particularly worried about that aspect. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —With the apparent unwillingness of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), on behalf of the Government, at this stage to open up debate on the Petroleum Retailing Marketing Sites Amendment Bill 1982 which was introduced by Senator Chipp, I guess it falls to me to indicate what the Australian Labor Party's response is to Senator Chipp's Bill. I say at the outset that the subject matter of this Bill seems to have been the subject of a fairly intense Press release war conducted between Senator Chipp and the Labor party spokesman on business and consumer affairs, Mr John Brown, in recent weeks . I think it would be unfortunate if some aspects of that paper warfare were to intrude into this debate this afternoon. I refer in particular to an allegation which Senator Chipp has made about Mr Brown and the Labor Party which, I suspect , he might be tempted to make again this afternoon-that is, that any change of attitude on the Labor Party's part, as compared with the position we supposedly took on this issue two or three years ago, can only be the product of our being prisoners of the oil companies or our having sold our principles for some mess of pottage in the form of financial remuneration from the oil companies.

There is no foundation whatsoever for any such allegation-that scarcely needs to be said. To the extent that the Labor Party may, for the moment anyway, be perceived as having in some respect modified its position on the question of support for the divorcement principle-

        The fundamentals of the Bill introduced by Senator Chipp concern the retail petroleum market and the question of who is entitled to control retail outlets in that market. I make the point, right at the outset again, that one cannot make judgments about the market in this respect in the abstract. One has to consider the economic forces that are at work in the petroleum cycle as a whole- oil prices, refinery production, consumer demand-and to consider the way in which all of these are affected by the regulation proposed at different stages in that cycle and, more particularly, the way in which they are affected at the particular time at which the regulation is being proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make it quite clear that the Opposition's primary concerns in deciding its approach to regulatory legislation in this area of petroleum marketing are twofold. First, the position of consumers-at the moment, those people who are prisoners of the prices at the petrol pump-and, secondly, the interests of those small business men and women who are the independant operators or franchisees in this area and who, obviously, have a great stake in the way in which this petroleum pricing regulatory legislation operates. Not only do they have a stake in it but also a large number of employees who work on the driveways of service stations around this nation have a stake in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The thrust of Senator Chipp's Bill, which will be familiar to those who have taken the trouble to study its very short compass, is to apply, with effect from 1 July next year, the principle of 100 per cent divorcement in the retail marketing situation. That is to say, from that date it is proposed by Senator Chipp that the oil companies will no longer be in a position of directly retailing, through commission agents, petrol on the service station driveways. We in the Labor Party oppose that proposal by Senator Chipp to the extent that it would require the more or less immediate achievement of the full 100 per cent divorcement principle. I will say something more later about our attitudes to divorcement generally and about where we think we ought to be going. We oppose Senator Chipp's immediate proposal although we will be making it abundantly clear, by the way in which we express that opposition and more particularly in the amendment which I hope has been circulated and which I will move at the Committee stage, that we are certainly not in any way interested in selling out or undermining the interests of the small business proprietors by virtue of a passionate enthusiasm for the predatory activities of the major oil companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The debate on this Bill makes sense only if one understands some fundamental things about the structure of the retail petroleum market. The situation is that , apart from the relatively small independent operations run by wholesale-retail groups such as ACTU-Solo, XL Petroleum Pty Ltd and one or two others, there are three basic categories of petrol retail outlets. In the first place, the largest category consists of lessee-operated stations owned by the oil companies themselves. The operators of these stations are known generically as franchisees . They lease the stations from companies and buy some, although not necessarily all, of their petrol from the company which owns the site that they lease. They pay a wholesale price to the oil company and set their own retail price. The second category is that of the independent owner-dealer stations who have no direct ties with any particular oil company, although almost invariably they have purchasing arrangements with a particular company. Again, they pay a wholesale price for the petrol from the major oil companies and set their own retail price.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third category-it is really quite small in terms of numbers-is the category about which this whole debate revolves today. It represents only about 6 per cent of the total number of service station outlets-at the moment that is something like 600 out of 11,500 service station outlets in the country. These are the company-owned stations operated by commission agents. The commission agent collects a fixed amount on each litre of petrol sold with the retail price being set by the oil company itself. I will refer to these sorts of stations as company sites or directly-operated company sites. This is the category about which we are concerned in this Bill. This is the category of service stations which Senator Chipp's Bill seeks to wipe out from the marketing scene and to ensure that for the future or, as the Bill puts it, from July next year all service stations are run either as franchisee operations or on the basis of independent owner-dealership arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wholesale price in the petroleum marketing industry is regulated by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority which was established in December 1981 out of the wreckage of the Prices Justification Tribunal. That is the operation at the national level. In addition, we have some State government regulation of wholesale prices in South Australia and New South Wales. Retail prices are not controlled except in New South Wales and South Australia and, as I have said, can be set by individual retailers, although there are growing moves around the place-this is part of the problem of fragmentation in the industry at the moment -for Government intervention directly in the retail pricing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further background to the debate, particularly important in the light of the allegations made by Senator Chipp about fundamental changes in the Labor Party's position, is the 1980 legislation which followed upon the 1976 report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum and the famous Fife package of proposals of 30 October 1978.
       </para>
       <para>
        That 1980 legislation dealt with two out of the three categories of retail outlet which I have referred to; namely, it dealt with the position of franchisees and it also dealt, in a way that Senator Chipp now seeks to amend, with the position of commission agents or company sites. That legislation contained nothing about the independent owner-dealer stations. As to franchisees , the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act of 1980 laid down certain rules to ensure that oil companies-franchisors-could not exploit franchisees, with protection given in the areas of obligatory disclosure, minimum terms for the operation of the franchise, and prohibitions on price discrimination by the oil companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as commission agents are concerned, the situation was established by the 1980 legislation as follows: Section 10, which Senator Chipp's Bill now seeks to amend, created a general prohibition on oil companies-or the so-called prescribed corporations-operating retail outlets. That absolute prohibition, however, was subject to a stated exception in sub-clause 10(3) and that exception was a provision that the companies were not to operate more than the maximum prescribed number of retail sites. In further provisions of the legislation, the prescribed number of sites was stated in a quota formula in such a way as to achieve a target of a divorcement of 50 per cent of the industry; that is, a divorcement, a cessation, of the direct selling role of the oil companies and 50 per cent of those companies' sites by September 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a series of complications and further developments as that process has worked itself out but basically that is what has happened. There has been a very significant divorcement, but it has not been achieved to the extent originally proposed and required in the legislation, and the September 1982 target date has not in fact been met. I understand it is proposed by the Government to introduce legislation quite soon to amend retrospectively that particular quota situation so as to allow until May next year for the number of company-owned sites to be reduced to the target of 50 per cent. A total of 401 sites is proposed to be achieved by May next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party's position on the 1980 legislation when it was introduced has been stated by Senator Chipp as amounting to support not only for the legislation but also for something rather more than that legislation provides, that is to say, the principle of complete 100 per cent divorcement. Certainly there have been statements by some ALP spokesmen from time to time which could be construed in that way.

         —Mr Hurford stated on 16 September that he doubted the legislation would survive two years in its present form. He moved a second reading amendment proposing that a review of the legislation take place within 18 months of its commencement with a view to deciding upon a further reduction of the number of sites operated by the major oil companies. That is true. That amendment also called for regulation of the prices charged by oil companies through their own sites. However, it did not in terms call for total divorcement, nor did Mr Hurford at any stage in that speech-I challenge Senator Chipp to point to any passage-call for total divorcement in the industry. The speech makes reference to total or partial divorcement as being an appropriate goal or target that ought to be pursued by all good men and true who are interested in getting some rationalisation in the industry and the protection not only of consumers but also of small businessmen whose activities were then undoubtedly being prejudiced by the behaviour-and the often predatory behavioir-of the major oil companies.

         —Senator Chipp can construe that in any way he likes. He will have plenty of opportunity to do so when he replies. I simply make the point that on that occasion Mr Hurford did not explicitly commit the Labor Party to do anything more than to set in train a review within a couple of years, to see how the process was working out, with a view undoubtedly to increasing the percentage of divorcement, given the situation as Mr Hurford, and indeed as the Labor Party, then saw it. However, there have been pronouncements from time to time by various spokesmen, I readily acknowledge, which have expressed our attitude to this matter-not in recent years; they tend to go back two or three years-in terms which make clear our commitment to the general principle of divorcement and which have gone further than this particular parent legislation now before us.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        But if Senator Chipp seeks to extract from the formal Labor Party statements at that time, or at any subsequent time, an absolute, unequivocal commitment to 100 per cent divorcement of a kind which reflects the situation that now prevails in the market-place, he will have a very difficult task. But that is all simply swapping debating points. The main thing we need to do is come to grips with the situation as it prevails at the moment. The main thing I need to do in order to advance this debate to a slightly more rational plane is to explain why at this time we oppose Senator Chipp's proposal for complete 100 per cent divorcement by July next year. We do so for what I think I can describe fairly succinctly as three basic reasons. Firstly, we do so in terms of the protection of the interests of consumers, at least so far as price protection is concerned. The second point relates to the protection of consumers in relation to other aspects of concern to them. Thirdly, I express our opposition in terms of concern we have about the unreality of the timetable contained in Senator Chipp's Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us begin at the beginning with the position of the consumers-an interest group which extends over the nation at large. Reference to them and to their interests was conspicuously lacking in Senator Chipp's public pronouncement on this issue. He has been very vociferous, naturally and understandably, in support of the interests of the service station proprietors and the independent operators. But it seems to the Labor Party that he has not given equally enthusiastic attention to the interests of the consumers who, after all, are an even larger group of people in the Australian community. I am not suggesting for a moment that the interests of the operators should be ignored. But certainly the interests of consumers ought to rank rather higher than they seem to in Senator Chipp's approach so far. What we say so far as consumers are concerned is that, first of all, they are undoubtedly benefiting in price terms at the moment, although I readily acknowledge that that situation may change, from the direct presence of the oil companies in the retail market.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we all know, there is a glut in the supply of petroleum products at the moment, much more so than was the case in 1980. That, in itself, would tend to force prices down in the retail market. But the reality is, as we all well know, that the main force in the market at the moment for keeping retail prices down, as can be confirmed by anyone who simply drives around the streets of the cities and towns of this nation with his eyes open, is the big gallonage outlets, by and large self-service, run by commission agents directly on behalf of the major oil companies. Each of them sell, on average, something like three times the volume of the other categories of service station outlets.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the absence of these company sites, the likelihood seems to be that in the main service station operator associations, gathered as they are under the umbrella of the Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, would combine their forces to drive up the retail price of petrol. That has been, so far as we can discern, the experience elsewhere. In particular it has been the experience in the American State of Maryland, although the facts of that matter have been, I know, the subject of some disputation between Senator Chipp and Mr Brown. Certainly that seems a plausible expectation and it is one that, as far as I am aware, has not significantly been denied by any serious minded commentator on this whole difficult subject.
       </para>
       <para>
        So on the immediate specific question of the price benefit that consumers are getting, looking at that criterion alone, it seems to me that Senator Chipp has a very difficult argument to beat in terms of the role that the major oil companies are playing through their direct selling outlets in keeping those prices down. I am not suggesting for a moment that that is the only relevant criterion to apply, but it is certainly an extremely important one so far as the consumers of this nation are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second consideration which I think ought to come into question and which I think is a relevant touchstone for debate here is the extent to which consumers are arguably suffering in other than price terms at this stage. To the extent that they are suffering as a result of the presence in the market place of the direct selling companies, that is a situation that would cause profound concern and would undoubtedly demand the closest possible monitoring on our part and would almost by itself be a significant enough consideration to make us change our attitudes to Senator Chipp's Bill. But we take the view that there is no evidence that consumers are suffering in other than price terms at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        We acknowledge that there is more to consumer protection than simply price levels. We acknowledge that there is a consumer interest which in this respect overlaps with that of the independent proprietors in maintaining a reasonable number of accessible sites and maintaining driveway service for those unhappy about the glittery self-service environment of most of the direct company outlets. And there is a consumer interest, of course, in maintaining a composite service, with garage service facilities available on as many driveways as possible around the nation. But it becomes a question of how one weighs the evidence of the impact of the direct company sites in this respect, and what weight one gives to these components of consumer protection against the competing element of the price interest for consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been acknowledged by everyone who has ever had a look at this matter that there has been, over the years, an undoubted need for rationalisation of the service station environment. It has been acknowledged that there were too many stations operating on marginal returns and that that was not to the benefit of the consumer because of the way in which prices were being maintained at an artificially high level. It has been the case that a significant rationalisation has occurred. Whether now, with the number of sites below 12,000 nationally, we are still in the rationalisation phase or whether, rather, we are starting to bite into the consumer interest in maintaining a large number of stations around the place, an interest which is shared by the independent operators themselves, is a matter for reasoned argument. It is not a matter for slogan swapping or shouting abuse at each other. It is a relevant consideration and something which needs very close monitoring. It is also matter for argument and for further evidence as to just what extent the independent operators have been forced out of business by the operation of the direct company sites and, as a result, the extent to which consumers have been prejudiced by not having readily available access to the number of driveway operations that they would like to have. On this aspect, I think, the ball is back in Senator Chipp's court to produce the evidence. The company sites represent, as we have said, about 6 per cent or so of the total number of sites and, however strategically located those company sites may be, and undoubtedly most of them are, and however aggressive their marketing policy may be, it is difficult to believe that those 6 per cent of outlets, even if they represent closer to 20 per cent, as I suspect they do, of the total gallonage sold-or litreage, as we now have to say-can be causing the casualties and wreckage on the scale that is asserted by Senator Chipp and those who take or share his particular--

        The final point I make to explain our opposition is that even if it is accepted that 100 per cent full divorcement is an immediately desirable objective and even if one buys Senator Chipp's line, with all its passion, hook line and sinker it seems to the Opposition that the 1 July 1983 deadline is a hopelessly unrealistic one. It has already beccome the case, as we know, that the September 1982 deadline has been subject to slippage and it will not be until May next year that the number of company sites will be down to 400. We are concerned about that because we are anxious that that divorcement of at least 50 per cent be achieved as soon as possible. But the reality is that by May next year there will still be at least 400 company sites in operation, and it is just wholly unrealistic to think in terms of being able to fully wipe out these sites from the market place within a mere two or three months after that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said all that, it is clear that all is not wholly rosy in the petroleum retailing situation at the moment. There needs to be additional protections. There needs to be additional forms of assistance to the independent operators. I will identify two areas in particular that we think are appropriate. One of them is the subject of the amendment to be moved in the Committee stage. The other is something that does not lend itself to amendment but certainly lends itself to appropriate government action.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first thing that is going wrong and needs to be radically changed is the operation of the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority. There is an enormous amount of dissatisfaction around the place with the maximum wholesale price levels being set by that authority. There needs to be an immediate government review, not just of the legislation, which on the face of it is basically satisfactory, but of the way that that particular authority is operating. There needs to be a fundamental reconsideration as to whether it has been much too generous to the oil companies in the way in which it is assessing what are justifiable wholesale prices. There needs to be a consideration of what seems, on the face of it, to have been a failure sufficiently to take into account productivity gains in shipping, refining and other areas which have been to the benefit of the oil companies. If the maximum wholesale prices were reduced below the levels that the PPPA is currently allowing, that would be to the manifest benefit of the independent operators whom not only Senator Chipp but also ourselves are anxious to protect. In this respect also, as the Labor Party has constantly said, there is a real concern around the place, which we certainly share, about the fragmentation in pricing policy, not only at the wholesale level with some of the States getting into the act but also with the anticipation on several States getting into the area of retail price limit setting. Basically this has to be a national function performed by a national body. The PPPA is the one to do it. We have argued constantly for the need to get all the relevant parties together to try to devise an appropriate national policy. We will certainly be monitoring the situation very closely with that in mind.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remaining thing that needs to be done by way of protecting the interests of the independent operators is to beef up the legislative protection that they have from the predatory or potentially predatory activities of the major oil companies. There are protections against price discrimination and so on in the Trade Practices Act. There is also in the Trade Practices Act a generalised protection, in section 46--

It is for that reason, because we do believe they need some more muscle, some more counterweight in the legal environment, that we will move our amendment. I will say more in the Committee stage on what the amendment is about and how we propose that it work. I just hope that the Senate, and in particular Senator Chipp, will acknowledge that this is a sincere attempt on our part to demonstrate our concern not only with the interests of consumers but also those of the independent operators. One simply cannot approach a topic as complex as this with the totally blinkered or one-eyed approach that has so far prevailed within the Australian Democrats. I repeat that we are not totally, wholly, finally or irrevocably opposed to the concept of full divorcement. Quite the contrary; we have a totally open mind on the subject. We certainly would hope that as the situation changes-in particular, the market-place situation-further rational consideration will be given to this by everyone. Certainly we will be doing that in government. Nothing that we say today in opposition to Senator Chipp's Bill should be taken in any way as a final statement of Australian Labor Party opposition to the concept of full divorcement. We just believe that the way the system is operating right now, the way the market-place is operating right now, it is the wrong Bill at the wrong time.

         —I rise on this occasion to exhibit a degree of unanimity with Senator Evans, who has just resumed his seat. This fact is sufficiently unusual for me to draw attention to it. Like him, I will endeavour calmly and dispassionately to address myself to the reasons why. I think it would be accepted in the chamber that this is a matter which is not without difficulty. We have had certain legislation before us in the last few years and many honourable senators would have been involved in the very lengthy discusions and considerations which preceded that legislation. I do not think there is any need to apologise for those lengthy discussions, as the complexities arise in part because there are many different legitimate interests involved in this area. The difficulties arise because those legitimate interests are sometimes in conflict and there is not necessarily a totally right solution to some of those conflicts. I suppose it can be said fairly simply, and certainly very accurately, that out prime concern needs to be for the consumers because in this case the consumers affected are the great bulk of the Australian people. We are a country which depends very substantialy on motor transport and the delivery of fuel to the private motorist is a very important factor in the general welfare and operations of our community.

       <para>
        So, in assessing how we should approach the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill introduced by Senator Chipp, we have a primary obligation to the consumers. They are the people who are most numerically affected. I do not for a moment suggest that they are the only people afected. That view is a view which it seems to me is in part the basis of what has been put before the Senate this afternoon by Senator Evans on behalf of the Opposition. He has laid emphasis on the present interests of consumers and how they are being served by the system as it is operating in 1982. I respectfully agree that that is a proper consideration for the Senate. Indeed, it is a major consideration which we must take into account.
       </para>
       <para>
        Vertical integration is the subject matter of this amending legislation today and, in part, of the Government legislation introduced a couple of years ago. In this context it has the potential to bring about anti-competitive or non- competitive conditions. That is why the legislation is of significance to the consumer. At the same time, obviously-the Government has done this-we must take into account the interests of the very large number of small businessmen who are operating service stations. The number of service stations in Australia has varied from time to time but we are dealing with in excess of 10,000 individual businesses and obviously they are of considerable significance. Those small businessmen have their own interests to be concerned about and the Government, and the Opposition, should look to the proper protection of their interests. They, too, have a foot in the door of the public interest argument. After all, the maintenance of competitive elements in this industry is important in maintaining competitive services to consumers. That has an effect on price and an effect on service, and therefore the welfare of those myriad small businessmen who are involved is a matter which again affects the public interest .
       </para>
       <para>
        The major oil companies, which I suppose because of their relatively small number are the easiest to dismiss in an argument about the public interest, do on the other hand have some legitimate interests to be considered also. I would have thought that there would be agreement from the Australian Democrats, if not from the Opposition, that the oil companies that are restricted by the existing legislation in a quite severe way, and would be affected more severely by the proposed amendment, do have legitimate interests, and that they are entitled to enter freely into commerce limited only by the expectation or requirement that they should not act in a way which is against the public interest. In particular , we would be concerned in this situation that they are not acting in a way which is destructive of competition. Having said that, I think it is important that those parties that acknowledge that private capital and private business- private enterprise-have their part to play in our economy, acknowledge also that they are entitled to have their legitimate interests protected.
       </para>
       <para>
        I adopt one of the very substantial reasons put forward by Senator Evans for opposing this Bill. The Bill proposes what I regard as a dramatically sudden divestment of the remaining oil company sites. It proposes to insert into the existing legislation a date which would require very severe and rapid divestment . That alone is a reason for opposing the amending legislation brought forward by the Australian Democrats.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to a little background to explain the Government's position on this legislation and why we propose at this stage to maintain the stance we maintained up to the introduction of Senator Chipp's Bill. We did, as is common knowledge, legislate in 1980. The legislation which we put through requires the major oil companies to effect a reduction of approximately 50 per cent in the number of directly operated retail outlets that they operated at 30 May 1980. That objective has been substantially achieved. It may be slightly obscured by a technical problem in that it appears that the oil company depots have been caught within the definition and so there has been a need to provide an extension of the numbers under the regulations to prevent the oil companies being required to divest themselves of their own depots. Subject to that, the divestment required by the law has been achieved, if not completely then very nearly.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Government introduced its petroleum marketing legislation-the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act-it did so after very detailed and careful examination of the problems confronting the petroleum industry. In particular, the Government considered that some degree of divorcement was necessary because first the trend towards vertical integration in the petrol retailing industry had caused a lot of concern due to its effect on independent small business in the industry. I think the small business part of the industry was most effective in drawing those concerns to the attention of the Government and, I am sure, the Opposition . Secondly, there was concern that increased vertical integration would have long term anti-competitive effects. Clearly, the concern was that if the wholesale suppliers of petrol were able to drive the independent operators from the market place in the long term they would be in the position where because of reduced competition they were able substantially to increase the cost of fuel to Australian consumers. The Government was conscious that some oil companies might unjustifiably react to the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act by converting outlets from franchise operations to company operations. They are all matters which were in the mind of the Government and which affected the legislation which was brought in several years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision on the level of divorcement was, of its very nature, arbitrary. There is no magic number and there is probably no way even with the most detailed attempt at government regulation to set a figure which will produce a perfect degree of balance of the different objectives which we are seeking. The Government was faced with a need to decide on a level which would achieve its objectives with the minimum practicable degree of intervention in the industry. I think that is an important point because, as I said before, the three areas of interest are the consumers, small business and the oil companies. Each of those, by their nature, are legitimate interests. The degree of interference with them ought to be the minimum that is required to achieve the proper objectives of protecting the public interest. The Government did not believe, when it introduced that legislation-it does not believe it now with the basic premise that has been put forward by Senator Chipp-that the complete divorcement of major oil companies from direct operation of service stations is either necessary or desirable. The restriction of oil companies to a small number of sites in proportion to total site numbers prevents any danger of excessive vertical integration or market power.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to delay the Senate unduly, but Senator Evans gave some figures in relation to this matter. A very small proportion of petrol station sites are controlled by the major companies. That is a factor in determining the Government's attitude that there is not at this stage excessive vertical integration. At the same time, I think there are positives in the present situation. Again I advance a point which is common to the point put forward by Senator Evans on behalf of the Opposition; namely, that the present arrangements do in practice appear to work in favour of consumers and do induce a quite strong competitive element in the present retailing of petrol in the market place in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The divorcement that we decided upon in 1980 was a phased-in operation. That was a simple concession to the practical realities of making substantial changes to commercial operations. Some companies had to convert the method of operation of a large number of sites. That had to be done in an orderly and efficient way and without disturbing our existing contractural arrangements. So it was not possible to make overnight changes; they had to be done gradually. The 1980 legislation provided for that. In the result it is only now that we are further along the track that the full effect of that divorcement is beginning to be felt . We are now being asked, as a Senate, to catapult into a further stage which would completely divorce the oil majors from any petrol retailing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned earlier that there is one difficulty in the legislation that has come to light. It is essentially a difficulty of a technical nature rather than of substance. The Act has a wider than intended application to oil company agent operated depots where some fuel is sold at the site. I suppose any of us who have campaigned as senators are familiar-even if we are not rural dwellers-with the spread of oil company depots around Australia. Pending amendments of the legislation to rectify the problem the Government, as an interim measure only-I stress that it is an interim measure-and to avoid disruption of the industry has increased company site allocations to take account of depots. That increase is solely due to the need of companies to have quota cover for depots. It in no way represents a stepping back from the divestment requirements of the 1980 legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes a level of divorcement of about 50 per cent based on 1980 figures is sufficient to be effective. We are committed to the petroleum retail marketing legislation and will ensure that it operates fairly and effectively. We do not believe that complete divorcement of oil companies from petrol retailing has been shown to be needed for the benefit of the public or the industry at present.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should perhaps comment very briefly on the fact that Senator Evans has brought into the debate quite separate considerations and concerns other than those which are dealt with under this legislation. I do not wish to offend the Standing Orders by going beyond the bounds of the legislation with which we are dealing now; suffice to say that, as I have just indicated to the Senate, we are interested in the effective operation of the legislation. We are anxious to see the public interest protected and the legitimate interests of those three groups protected. The sorts of concerns which have been raised by Senator Evans are concerns which can be addressed in that broader context. I will certainly draw them to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Peacock).
       </para>
       <para>
        To conclude, the Government is opposed to the amending legislation which has been put forward by Senator Chipp. It does not believe that a requirement that on or before 1 July 1983 there should be a total divestment by the oil companies of their remaining sites is a reasonable thing to impose upon them at this stage . The Government does not believe it is necessary to protect the competitive position or to protect the basic interests of retailers. Accordingly, we will be opposing the amending Bill.

         —I rise today, not unsurprisingly, to support Senator Chipp's Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill which sets out to amend the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act which was one of two Acts which the Government introduced after considerable pressure from the industry-that is, from the retailing section of the industry-to allegedly, at least, incorporate the proposals in the Fife package. I support this Bill and the amendment that it contains because, like Senator Chipp, I have been closely involved with the problems inherent in this area. Indeed, Senator Chipp and I had a friendly struggle earlier this year to decide which of the two of us was the more intimately involved with the problems of petrol resellers and which of the two of us would introduce the Bill.

        It is not unnatural to find a South Australian senator or member of parliament concerned with the problems that have arisen over the last few years, to crisis point, within the petrol retail marketing area. South Australia is in a vulnerable situation, given its size and its isolation, when it comes to the provision of fuel. It is not surprising that the impetus of the action that was finally taken to try to force the Government to pay attention to the problems came from South Australia. The South Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce Incorporated, concerned as it was with the unstable conditions that were increasingly manifesting themselves in the industry, with the decline of services that were being provided by service stations with the influx of self- serve stations and, of course, with the increasing number of bankruptcies in the area, arranged for a series of motions to be put at its annual general meeting which was held in March 1980. To attract as much attention as it could from among its member resellers, it sent out a number of advertising leaflets. Included in those leaflets were comments such as: 'Do you think you have a profitable future in the petrol retail industry as it is running now?', and 'You won't have any future if you don't unite as a force and implement action-in this election year-to secure that future'. Here is a group, whose members are predominantly men, who are almost to a person Liberal voters, taking what must have been to them both radical and drastic action, since they received considerably less than sympathetic hearings from both State and Federal politicians until then. One of the leaflets stated:

         —Yes, yet another election promise that was never brought to fruition by Malcolm Fraser. The organisations concerned, and in particular the Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, then took the unprecedented step of retaining the services of a Canberra-based professional lobbyist. That organisation intended it to be his job to ensure that every Cabinet Minister was deluged with all the information necessary to convince them that protective legislation had to be enacted prior to the election. It was concerned that the active lobbying that had been undertaken by petrol retailers in all States in the previous two years had had amazing results with their Federal parliamentarians on an individual basis but had apparently not produced the required legislation at the Government or Cabinet level.

       <para>
        But there were politicians-senators, members of parliament-at both the State and Federal levels who were prepared at least to go and listen and to make statements and indicate what they would do given the opportunity to assist these people. An Adelaide Advertiser clipping dated Saturday, 7 June 1980, gives an indication of what Mr Hayden, the Leader of the Labor Party-I suggest he would be speaking with more authority than even Chris Hurford-went to South Australia to talk to these people and, as I said, made some commitments. The article started off:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Opposition leader, Mr Hayden, learnt a few things in Adelaide yesterday when he faced a meeting of about 40 petrol resellers at the headquarters of the SA Automobile Chamber of Commerce.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hayden was told of pressure tactics applied to resellers to sack staff and convert to self-serve, of long-term leases being withdrawn, of instructions being given as to what price to sell petrol, and of massive rent increases on properties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many said the rent increases would force them to lay off staff.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are guerrilla tactics which, of course, can be undertaken by multinational organisations which know that the cards are stacked entirely in their favour. Mr Hayden, having listened to all this and having attended the meeting, was reported to have then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . if Labor were in power, the total Fife Package-a proposal by Mr Fife, a former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs-which would provide protection for resellers and control over oil companies, would be brought into force within six months.
       </para>
       <para>
        Presumably in saying that, in referring to the Fife package, he was indicating quite clearly that given the opportunity Labor would support 100 per cent divorcement in the retail petroleum industry. He said he would do all he could to pressure the present Government to take action on the package. The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        He said an unhealthy relationship existed between the Government and the major oil companies--
       </para>
       <para>
        Again an unhealthy relationship which may well have gone beyond that between the major oil companies and the Liberal Party-
       </para>
       <para>
        with the companies reaping in thousands of millions of dollars a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of this money was finding its way out of the country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only loyalties of the companies were to maximise profit and export that profit overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly in September 1980 a Labor back bencher, Mr Les Johnson, the honourable member for Hughes, took to heart what had been said there because he is recorded at page 1323 of the Hansard of that year to have said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Full divorcement is the only acceptable and workable situation to prevent the emergence of artificial situations in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there were Labor politicians, from their leader to back benchers, who were quite adamant and open in their support of the need for 100 per cent divorcement -at least they were in 1980. The Government, however, was another kettle of fish altogether. In response to the pleas of the retailers the Government reneged on the divorcement proposals which were an integral part of the Fife package and instead chose not to eliminate altogether retail marketing by oil companies but to introduce only 50 per cent divorcement on the grounds that it believed it would be sufficient to achieve its aims of stabilising the industry. There was in addition, of course, the theory that the elimination of company operated sites by 50 per cent would radically reduce competition in the market. In other words, it had bowed to oil company pressure and was prepared to leave the oil companies in a still substantially powerful position in the market. The policy decision by the Government was to cut down rather than to eliminate owner- operated sites and could only be seen as a half-way measure, pandering, if you like, to the demands of the oil companies and putting those beyond its alleged concern for both the consumer and the small businessman in the market.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will refer a little later to recent events in South Australia, but it has been patently apparent since 1980 that cutting back by 50 per cent the involvement of the oil companies directly in the retail marketing section has not had the results that the Government thought it would. I refer honourable senators to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of February this year entitled: 'Proprietors going to wall-companies get the blame'. One of the arguments that the Government put for introducing 50 per cent divorcement was that this would be sufficient to stem the tide of bankruptcies and the consequent lack of employment. Unfortunately, it was not the case. The author of the article, Peter Freeman, began by saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        The next time you drive into a petrol station, spare a thought for the proprietor: if the fate of many of his counterparts throughout Australia is any indication, his business days are numbered.
       </para>
       <para>
        So by 20 February 1982 the situation had changed very little from what it was in March, April and May 1980. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the past 10 years 7,435 petrol stations have shut up shop, cutting the total number from 18,883 in 1972 to 11,488 last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Frequently the initiative has come from the companies themselves with the goal of rationalising their distribution networks . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        On other occasions it was the proprietor, whether an owner-operator or a lessee to the oil giants, who closed down in the face of dwindling profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Irrespective of who took the final decision, most service station operators have no doubt where to lay the blame-it is all the fault of ruthless, money- hungry oil companies which in the search for ever bigger profits, squeeze the little man dry.
       </para>
       <para>
        This was admitted by at least one oil company official who said:
       </para>
       <para>
        'What we want is the maximum possible cash flow to help finance diversification , especially into other resource areas.' . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        'This means selling as much petrol as quickly as possible even if we can only make a quarter of a cent per litre.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Company-owned self serve outlets operated by commission-paid agents serve this end: prices can be cut quickly whenever a company has a big surplus of petrol to unload.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even given that situation, not satisfied with the problem not being solved by the 50 per cent divorcement measure, in August of 1982 the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack) put out a Press release saying that, because of a variety of administrative problems, the Government was going to extend the time that the oil companies had to divest themselves of even half of their sites. The following point was made in that Press statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Durack said the Government had decided to postpone the date when the new site allocations took place on the grounds of equity and to prevent disruption to the supply of petrol and diesel fuel, particularly in rural areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, he had no awareness of, or if he did he had no concern for, the disruption that was still being caused in the industry by the guerrilla tactics of the oil companies as occurred when Caltex pulled a stunt in South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In September of this year, Caltex-Golden Fleece decided that it would drop the price at its seven company-owned sites in the Adelaide metropolitan area. The Advertiser ran a story headed 'Caltex cuts petrol price' with a sub-heading '34. 9c a litre set in sales ''gamble'' '-a gamble, of course, which oil companies with their massive profits, with their international ownership, can afford to take. They can afford to sell petrol at ridiculous losses for days on end until they have wiped out their opponents because they know that the franchisees and independent owners cannot hope for any length of time, given their mortgages and various other debts, to cope with the sorts of pressures that these sorts of price-cutting wars invoke.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article in the Advertiser stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Caltex-Golden Fleece company yesterday took a 'business gamble' to regain lost petrol sales in South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it is prepared to do that in South Australia where petrol sales would probably have to be the lowest of any State, imagine what it is likely to do when it puts its tiny mind to the problem in States such as Victoria and New South Wales? The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The company set 34.9c as the retail price for super at its seven company-owned or operated sites in the metropolitan area and lessee sites quickly moved to match the price.
       </para>
       <para>
        The lessee sites were able to do that because the company gave rebates or discounts on the wholesale price to lessee operators who came to it saying that their business was being affected by the lower retail prices, which were being offered at sites owned by the same company which was providing them with their petrol. The State manager of Caltex-Golden Fleece admitted there was quite a risk involved, that his company would be losing a substantial amount of money but that it could, of course, afford to. Fairly clearly, if seven company-owned sites out of the 450 service stations in Adelaide can produce a price-cutting war, even 50 per cent divorcement is demonstrably not sufficient.
       </para>

        That in itself would be bad enough. But the end result of this little attack by Caltex-Golden Fleece on the petrol-retail marketing area in South Australia was a considerable amount of violence against property and intended violence against people. On 27 September, two days after the Advertiser carried the story and two days after Caltex put its move into operation, the Advertiser ran another story, this time headed 'I'm carrying a gun, says petrol vendor'. The article began with the statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        A Caltex-Golden Fleece service station lessee says he is carrying a gun because he fears violence this week over the company's decision to cut the retail price of its petrol.

       <para>
        Mr R. W. Skipper said yesterday he believed there could be bloodshed at service stations this week because of angry petrol-industry reaction to the company's price of 34.9c a litre for super-grade petrol.
       </para>
       <para>
        He called on the Government to set fixed prices for petrol in South Australia ' to restore some sanity to the petrol industry and avoid what could turn into a real nasty situation.'
       </para>
       <para>
        The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Skipper's Caltex service station at Fullarton Road, Fullarton, was one of two service stations where pumps were damaged on Friday night following the price change.

        Mr Skipper believes people from a rival service station smashed glass panels and control units on five of his eight pumps, causing $15,000 damage.

        The article continued:

       <para>
        The executive director of the South Australia Automobile Chamber of Commerce, Mr R. A. Flashman, said he could understand the angry reaction to the price of petrol at Caltex-Golden Fleece service stations. 'Lessees from other companies believe they are faced with either watching their businesses and savings go down the drain or taking the law into their own hands,' Mr Flashman said.
       </para>
       <para>
        'We do not condone the damaging of pumps, but the action is not surprising.'

        Mr Flashman said he believed one of two things would happen.

        'Either Caltex will call the whole thing off or the other companies will follow and there will be a disconting war in which the main casualties will be the lessees,' he said.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact what eventuated was that Caltex called it off, having achieved what it said at the outset was its aim-that was, of attracting customers back.

        In his speech Senator Evans stated the attitude of the ALP this year, this month, today-perhaps we had better not take it any further than that since the Labor Party is likely to change its mind again tomorrow in the light of some of the comments that Senator Evans made about that party's determination in this regard. But he did state the present minute ALP attitude to the concept of 100 per cent divorcement. He feels that it is something that is likely to need to be looked at, that it is no doubt something which may well concern us in the future . But at the moment he said piously: 'We are concerned with beginning at the beginning', which was the way he put it 'and looking at the interests of the consumers and of the small businessman'. I would suggest that the consumers' interests are not being served in any way at all by 50 per cent divorcement when we have the sort of latent violence that is contained in the reports in the Advertiser of September of this year and when we consider that the influx of self-serve stations into the retail marketing area has meant a considerable loss for other services-not just driveway services but mechanics' services and so on- to motorists who are, after all, the consumers about whom Senator Evans was talking.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, the ALP's concern for the businessman or businesswoman and the people whom they employ would be touching if it were not for the fact that, as the Sydney Morning Herald indicates, people are still being forced to the wall, forced to give up their businesses and to put off their staff because of the predatory behaviour of the oil companies. Senator Evans said that the ALP had an open mind. I would suggest that the ALP's mind is more a palimpsest than anything else and that its amendment is in fact mealy-mouthed, chicken-hearted and lily-livered and any other anatomical analogy that one cares to bring up to describe something which indicates only that it is wriggling out of a commitment made by Mr Hayden in 1980. Indeed, from what I have seen of the amendment that the ALP hopes to move at the Committee stage, having forgotten that to do that first of all the legislation has to be passed at the second reading stage, it would appear that what the Labor Party is trying to do is a sort of petrol bottom-of-the-harbour stunt. It would remove entirely our clause 3, which is the only necessary clause in this Bill, and substitute its own. All that would remain of our legislation would be a shell, having been stripped of its assets to be left a vacuum by the tortuous amendment of the ALP. I support this Bill in the interests of stability in the industry, in the interests of security for the many small businesses in the industry and the thousands of people they employ, and for the ultimate benefit of the consumer.

         —in reply-In summing up there is little for me to say after that comprehensive and penetrating speech by my colleague Senator Haines. The Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill has been introduced for philosophical and practical reasons. The philosophical reason is that the Australian Democrats believe that it is basically wrong for a monopoly or oligopoly to control a scarce resource and petrol is a scarce resource. In fact, it is a resource which is becoming scarcer each year at a frightening rate. To have an oligopoly which in the past has been notorious for restrictive trade practices controlling the wholesale and retail outlets of a scarce resource is, we believe, philosophically wrong.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Secondly, we believe that the record of the oil companies in this country, particularly the multinational oil companies, has been one of deliberate destruction of Australian small business people who have owned, managed and operated service stations with the clear aim of having the total market to themselves. For this reason, I find it incomprehensible that the Australian Labor Party should oppose this Bill, which calls for 100 per cent divorcement. That means that it would not be legal for an oil company to own a service station. We could then have a separate industry retailing petrol, owned and operated by Australians with fair dinkum competition between them all so that the consumer is best served. We regard it as short-sighted and myopic to think, as Senator Evans illustrated, that because the odd price war between the oil companies goes on now and then and here and there that in the end is good for the consumer. Our view was illustrated by Senator Haines. Of course the consumer loves a price war in the short run. But what happens in a price war? Who are the casualties while the consumer temporarily benefits? The casualties are the Australian owned independent service stations. With every price war more and more fall and less and less competition is left in the way of the multinationals .
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the history of the industry. Both Senator Evans and Senator Chaney had a strange unity ticket on the question of multinational oil companies . They said: 'Chipp's Bill proceeds with indecent haste to bring about a certain result'. Indecent haste? This matter has been talked about and discussed for six years. In October 1978, after discussions had continued for two years, the then Liberal Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Fife, brought in a statement-it was called the Fife package-which stated that full divorcement was essential. The Fife package went even further. It said: 'When we bring in the legislation we will backdate it to October 1978'. That statement had shades of retrospectivity. But then the multinational oil companies got busy. They lobbied public servants, politicians, Ministers and ministerial staff.
       </para>
       <para>
        We did not see the legislation that was promised in the latter part of 1978. We did not see it in 1979. The clout of the international oil companies is enormous . Finally, a half-baked package was produced in 1980 which allowed the oil companies to divest themselves of only half their sites. That Bill, instead of penalising the oil companies and giving the Aussie battler a fair go, played into the oil companies' hands because it allowed them to rationalise their expenses. It allowed them to reduce the number of sites they had and at the same time to indulge in price cutting to an extent that sent independent Australian operators bankrupt by the thousands. Now two more years have passed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill would simply put the multinational oil companies out of the retail business. Is anything wrong with that? Senator Evans and Senator Chaney have not stated one aspect of what is wrong with competition among small business people. I can understand the Labor Party not becoming euphoric about small business people or any sort of business people. But what passes my comprehension is the action of the people who sit on the other side of the chamber-the Liberals and the National Party members-who espouse themselves as champions of private enterprise, of the small business people. At the next election it will make me want to vomit to hear members of the Liberal Party say: 'We champion the small business person', when, to a man and woman, they will vote against this legislation today. Such legislation has already been proved successful in the State of Maryland in the United States of America. I felt sorry for my friend Senator Evans today. No one but a consummately complete lawyer, as he is, could have handled such an impossible brief without breaking into laughter. What sort of brief was handed to him by Mr Brown, the Labor spokesman on this subject? I also find Mr Brown incomprehensible. I do not want to be too rude to the gentleman, but he said that the experiment in Maryland is a failure because prices have gone up. I do not want to be too savage on him but I think someone like Senator Evans who has a talent for imparting knowledge ought to tell Mr Brown that there is a thing called inflation in this world and that it has hit the United States of America and therefore the State of Maryland.

He and his party will be voting in such a way as to destroy totally the thrust of the private member's Bill that I have introduced today. I wish to place on record the fact that the Labor party will be voting to destroy totally the meaning, thrust and purpose of the Bill.

        In other words, Senator Evans wishes to delete clause 3. The casual reader of my speech might not realise the significance of leaving out clause 3-what it would do to my Bill. The Bill-it is not the thickest that has ever been brought before the Senate-consists of one page and has three clauses. The first comprises the title. The second states that it will come into operation when it receives assent. The third is the clause which provides for complete divorcement. That is the one that Senator Evans and the Labor Party want to knock out.

Mr Hurford attacked the Bill as providing:

       </para>
       <para>
        Very soon the oil companies will be able to command as much of the petrol retail market with 400 sites as they do today with 800.
       </para>
       <para>
        He made the further prediction that the 1980 Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act would not survive for two years, adding 'I doubt that it should'.
       </para>
       <para>
        What Senator Evans has overlooked today is that although the oil companies have 400 sites or so, a relatively small number, if they are consistently selling petrol 1c, 2c or 3c a litre cheaper than does the independent operator opposite, the latter will not get one customer; they will get the lot. That is exactly what has happened in the short time since half divorcement has come into being. The oil company operated sites are now selling up to three and four times as much as is the independent operator next door. And why would not the consumer, in the short term, buy the cheaper petrol?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Brown in explaining this about-face stated that it was because 'conditions have changed'. We are told the complete vertical integration of the petroleum market by the oil companies is helping competition and is bringing lower prices to consumers. I would agree with him on one thing-conditions have indeed changed ; they have become a lot worse. I invite Senator Evans, as he drives his vehicle around Melbourne at the weekend to ask any independent operator or lessees who run the service stations what they think of 50 per cent divorcement. He should ask that of the independent operator who is forced by the oil companies to leave a blank cheque at night under a rock next to his bowser because that is the only condition under which an oil company will deliver petrol to him. That is a deliberate, diabolical plot to send him broke, as they have done to thousands of others.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me quote the statistics. In 1979-80 the number of service station sites in Australia fell from 12,900 to 12,053, a loss in one year of 847 Australian small businesses. That represents 7 per cent of the total retail market. Yet, we find this Liberal Government allowing that to continue. The so-called, self-appointed champions of the small business person are allowing operators who account for 7 per cent of the retail market-847 Aussie battlers, if one may use that term-to be sent bankrupt deliberately, by foreigners, in one year.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1980-81, following the implementation of the 50 per cent divorcement law, the position was worse. Some 1,028 small businessmen were driven out of the petroleum retail market. They represented 8.5 per cent of the total market. The success of the predatory practices of the multinationals is increasing, not decreasing. Although I admire and share Senator Evans's concern for the consumer I ask: What sort of price is being paid to give consumers, temporarily, 1c or 2c off a litre of petrol? The figures for 1981-82 are not yet in, but I invite honourable senators to ask their local service station operator, or their colleagues, how the private sector is coping. Examples of the actions of the oil companies in sending the independent operators bankrupt have been detailed by my colleague, Senator Haines.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I must say that I am bitterly disappointed with the attitude of the Labor Party. I confess that I did not discuss the Bill with it before it hit the deck, so to speak. I knew what the attitude of the Liberal Party would be- that it would be clearly on the side of the multinationals-but I would have thought that the last political party in the country that would have come into this chamber to bat for multinational oil companies would be the Australian Labor Party. I took it for granted that, because of its stated policy, it would support the Bill. The Labor Party, even more than the Democrats, knows the form, the behaviour, of multinationals and their predatory activities against smaller business people. But no, for some extraordinary reason-all I can say is that my friend Senator Evans, and his colleagues have been very badly advised by their spokesperson on this question-the Opposition is saying that this Bill which would force multinational oil companies out of the retail market is not worth supporting.

        'and if the corporation does not take advantage of the power it has, in relation to the market for the retail sale of motor fuel, for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a person, being a competitor in that market of the corporation or its agents or of a body corporate related to the corporation'.''

       <para>
        The substance of this amendment is to take out clause 3 of the Bill, as the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Chipp) pointed out, and to substitute a proposition to add words to section 10 (3) of the principal Act. By agreement I rise to speak briefly and non-provocatively for the sole purpose of explaining what this amendment is about and what effect it would have if carried . It is my understanding that agreement has been reached for the debate to be adjourned when I have completed my remarks. The amendment essentially adds a further condition to section 10 of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act, a further requirement that has to be satisfied if the direct selling company sites are to stay in operation at all, even in a reduced number. The requirement is to add a further condition that has to be satisfied by each corporation, namely, that it is not to take advantage of its market power for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor.

It is essentially designed to protect the independent service station operators against various forms of predatory practice, including in particular predatory pricing, which they may be subject to by the major oil companies. Some protections are presently enjoyed by service station proprietors under other provisions of the Trade Practices Act, for example section 49 which relates to price discrimination. The language of section 46, on which the present amendment is based, does not, however, protect the independent operators at the moment for the reason that section 46 of the Act has, as a threshold requirement, the consideration that the corporation be one which is 'in a position substantially to control the market for goods or services'. In other words, the prohibition on section 46 predatory activity applies only when, in effect, there is a monopoly of the market in question and the selling of the product in question. Of course, when we are talking about petroleum marketing, whatever one might think of the role of the oil companies, they do not constitute a monopoly. No one of them is in a position substantially to control a market. As such, section 46 has no application.
       </para>
       <para>
        This then is an attempt to pick up and apply, for the protection of independent service station operators, that particular provision of the Trade Practices Act. Let me describe how it would work in practice. It has to be read in conjunction with section 12 of the parent Act. Provision is made for the court, on the application of the Minister or any person affected, to make an order restraining a prescribed corporation-which for this purpose includes the oil companies-from engaging in conduct that constitutes a contravention of section 10. If we make the conduct which would constitute a contravention of section 10 include predatory activities of this particular kind it would then be possible for a service station proprietor affected by the predatory or damaging activity to go to court and seek appropriate restraining orders. If the oil company were to ignore those restraining orders and to continue the activity in question the next step, of course, would be for the court to rule that the whole condition of the oil company being allowed to stay in the direct selling market would no longer be satisfied; at a stroke, a situation would be created where the oil companies would have to get out of retailing entirely because they would no longer be covered by section 10 protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        It all no doubt sounds a little technical, but that is what it is about. The amendment is expressly designed to protect independent operators from such predatory activity as the oil companies might still be disposed to take. I can understand Senator Chipp's unhappiness with at least the procural aspects of this proposal to the extent, I suppose, that it does amount to something of a legislative asset stripping operation. It is proposed that the Senate first vote to take out Senator Chipp's clause 3, and then to substitute the section put forward by the Opposition. I am sure that in the interests of the independent service station proprietors, whom Senator Chipp and his Democrats are so anxious to protect, he will ultimately come to see the wisdom of a provision of this kind being incorporated in the legislation in the event that his own clause 3 is in fact defeated. I think that is perhaps a sufficient explanation to keep us all happy until we meet again on this particular subject.

         —When the debate was adjourned in mid- afternoon I had finished explaining the change that this Bill seeks to make in the provisions for exempting some categories of users from the excise on diesel fuel. I also mentioned that the Government had already amended the Bill in three or four different ways in the House of Representatives since it had been introduced. Indeed, I think this measure is another good example of Government incompetence with the introduction of eleventh-hour amendments following Government back bench pressure to change or withdraw the Bill. In this instance, forms had been printed, then the Government, under pressure from its own back bench and from outside, decided to change the Bill. The forms had to be scrapped and new forms had to be printed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The rationale for imposing an excise tax on diesel fuel, and of course on petrol, has traditionally been that these are road transport fuels and that it is therefore appropriate that some tax be levied on the fuel to offset the public money that goes into road construction and maintenance. I do not know whether that rationale is still taken seriously by the Government but, if it is, we are now in the incongruous position of having the excise tax on diesel fuel being extended to apply to railways, so that fuel used for locomotives will be subject to the tax and thereby railways will be placed at a disadvantage vis-a- vis roads. The Government's explanation for making these changes in the way that certain categories of users are exempt from excise, as distinct from imposing the tax on other categories of users, is that the previous system had been abused-the system under which users of diesel fuel for non-road purposes obtained certificates of exemption from the tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is at least arguable that this new system is more open to abuse than the one it replaces. In any case, if the Government were really serious about ending abuses of the exemption, in whatever form it may be administered, it would do what a number of other countries have done in the same circumstances and add a dye to diesel fuel that is sold without excise for non-road use. Anyone caught with dyed diesel fuel in a vehicle or a piece of equipment which was not entitled to the exemption would be subject to quite heavy penalties. This effectively would deter people from doing so. I would have thought it was a matter of common sense that that was a system which was likely to work very efficiently. One would not need an army of inspectors, but periodic checks. It is self-evident that the incontrovertible evidence of dyed fuel in a vehicle or piece of equipment not entitled to use that fuel, and the provision of heavy penalties for such illegal use, would ensure that abuses were kept to a minimum. So I do not think it is credible that the Government has done this for that reason.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look around to see why the Government did it. I believe that, as with so many recent decisions, the genesis of this Bill can be found in the manic determination of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to have a premature election this year before everybody realises that the economy has collapsed, as it is now in the process of doing, and that this is introduced as a cosmetic exercise to make the deficit look a little bit more respectable-I put that word 'respectable' notionally-in Malcolm Fraser's terms than it otherwise would have been.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since none of the reasons that have been given for the introduction of this legislation will stand up to any sort of critical analysis, it seems that, if only by process of elimination, we come back to the conclusion that this is associated with the Prime Minister's desire to produce by cosmetic means a deficit more respectable, in his terms, than it would otherwise have been. I say by cosmetic means for this reason: The additional revenue collected-I have had a bit of difficulty getting these figures; there is no real information in the second reading speech but I trust and I believe that the figures are correct- because of the change in the way the exemption is administered, and because of some other peripheral changes for this financial year, will be $192m. The refund paid, according to the Estimates committee document, will be $112m. Of course, the difference is $80m. A small part of that can be attributed to the peripheral changes in categories of exemption and to the termination of whatever abuses may have accompanied the old system. But the greater part of that is a de facto interest free loan from farmers, the fishing industry and other previously, and still, exempt or ultimately exempt users of diesel fuel.
       </para>
       <para>
        One quite serious anomaly affects the mining industry in Western Australia where companies operating in the same industry in the same area are to be treated quite differently because of the way that the exemptions or the new rules are to be administered. Any excise paid on fuel used in transporting ore from the mine site to a processing site will be refundable. Two mining companies operate in the Pilbara. One company processes the ore on the mine site and rails it a couple of hundred miles to the port. The other company rails the ore a couple of hundred miles to the port and processes it there. Because one company is transporting ore by rail for processing, the fuel used will be subject to refund. The other company, which is processing the ore on the mine site and is therefore transporting processed ore, will not. That is a very clear anomaly for two companies which operate in the same area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another anomaly, in my view, is that in Western Australia, in the Northern Territory and, I presume, in at least some other States, public State electricity commission power or the equivalent of State electricity commission power is produced by power stations operated by diesel fuel. These power stations also will now be subject to excise and the price of electricity therefore must rise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, there is no doubt that the changes made consequential to this Bill will have some inflationary impact because they will boost transport and other costs across a quite wide variety of industries. However, despite the reservations that the Opposition has about these Bills, they are Bills which are clearly associated with the Budget. They will not be opposed by the Opposition. Following the view which we stated very quickly after the Budget was introduced, this Budget belongs to the present Prime Minister and the present Prime Minister will have to live with it. Ultimately, I believe, in the political sense, he will die with it.

         —I will make only a brief contribution on these diesel fuel tax legislation amendment Bills. I support what the legislation presumes to do. As in the case of most legislation which seeks to change or to extend taxation measures, we have had a lot of submissions and representations from all sorts of industries and users, Australia-wide. But we need to remember that the main reasons for this legislation were, firstly, to eliminate areas of considerable abuse and, secondly, as a revenue measure, to equalise transport operations, mainly between rail and road and between the public and private sectors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The legislation has introduced a change of method. Having for many years operated with exemption certificates, users are now in a position where they no longer get an exemption but they can claim a rebate. It is certainly not as easy as the old scheme but the Government believes that it is more secure. Private contractors will now find that they will pay the same net amount for their fuel when competing with government contractors on public works. Road transport operators will find that they are now paying a rate for their fuel equivalent to that for diesel locomotives. I think this is a good proposal, and I support it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have, however, as I say, had representations from a fairly wide range of users. I have not had an opportunity thoroughly to investigate many of these representations. Among the people who have contacted me have been pleasure craft operators, tourist boat operators, cheese manufacturers, fishermen, sawmillers, farmers, dry cleaners, abattoir operators, holiday resort operators and others. Senator Thomas, who is unable to be here at the moment, mentioned also the iron ore miners and the salt miners. I have taken quite a few of these representations forward, but not all of them, by any means. But I am advised that they will be looked at at a later stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am grateful that concessions have been provided to two of the groups I have represented. I refer to sections of the fishing industry and sections of the timber industry. I think the fishermen warrant a special mention. I and some of my colleagues in the Senate-I know Senator Withers and Senator Thomas were involved-made representations and secured, I am told, remissions for the participants in fishing co-operatives. The proposal that I certainly went along with was built on four grounds. I think this is important because, having gained a concession, there will be other groups which will believe that they have been unfairly treated. But in this particular case the reason why I supported the fishermen was that they were not looking for any extra exemption at all. We had a letter from the Acting Minister, Mr Fife, who made it quite clear that there had never been problems with fishermen with regard to malpractice in the use of fuel; that the fishermen themselves are the co-operatives and the co-operatives are the fishermen; and that from a practical sense, where we are looking at probably 3,000 to 4,000 individual fishermen, by doing it this way we might then be able to reduce that number to something like 50 or 60 co-operatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Thomas had a special problem with the iron ore industry, similar to that outlined by Senator Walsh. As he said, four companies, each using the same basic commodity and operating in the same area, will secure their fuel at different rates depending on the rebate to which they are entitled. I think that is an anomaly to which more attention needs to be paid. I just hope that it will be possible to tidy up that anomaly. I understand the difference there will be a matter of probably $2m to $3m between the companies transporting ore over the same route.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, I have been mixed up with the sawmillers. The problem there has been partly relieved. Again, we are still in the area of definition. I find it difficult to determine why fuel use in respect of logs which are brought into a mill and put across a saw bench attract a charge at one rate whereas if they go through the chipper the fuel used is charged for at a different rate. In fact, it is even worse than that because, if we really study this matter, we will find that part of the log will go through the saws and part will go through the chipper. I am not really sure how we can break up the difference in the charge for fuel in those two areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is needed, I think, is two small amendments to the definitions which are set out in proposed new section 164, subsection (7). Under the definition ' forestry', in paragraph (d) after the words 'the milling', the words 'or processing' should be added so that that paragraph reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) the milling or processing of timber at a sawmill that is not situated in the forest or plantation in which the timber was felled-
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to paragraph (e), I propose that after the words 'where timber is milled at a sawmill', the words 'woodchip or pulp mill' should be added so that the paragraph reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) where timber is milled at a sawmill, woodchip or pulp mill that are not situated in the forest or plantation in which the timber is felled . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Those changes would avoid any difficulties as it would be absolutely impossible for anybody to determine correctly what proportions of any log go through one process or the other. I do not believe in making things more difficult than necessary and I do not see how we can prevent problems if we create situations that will lead to problems. I urge that the Government take every possible step to have payments made with the utmost speed. Delays to date have been very expensive. In fact, I have a letter from the President of the Australian Fishing Industry Council, Mr Connell, which says:

        Those figures are up to 12 October. On the information that I have to date, providing this Bill goes through today and providing it gets royal assent within about a week, payments for the early ones should be in the clients' bank accounts by about 12 or 13 November. I would like to see that that is done. These people have been out of their money for a long time. An amount of that magnitude certainly requires attention and I would be pleased if the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) could confirm tonight that something like that would be possible and that the people who are at the beginning of this list will be treated as quickly as possible. I realise that there will be a large bank-up. I know that there will be difficulties for the officers in handling their first group of claims. But I do ask that every step be taken to get the first lot out as fast as possible because a considerable amount of money is involved and there has been considerable hardship in many cases as a result of this situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not see this legislation as being ideal by any means but I believe that had there been solid policing and appropriate penalties under the old system we could have largely secured satisfactory results. There have been changes, and I accept that, but I still believe that this matter has been handled in a way that is slightly less than ideal. I see that some doors have been left open and that there are areas that we will need to tidy up. I believe that people who have genuine problems will have the opportunity to have them tidied up. The minor matters should be able to be dealt with either by some small amendments or by regulations. However, I support the legislation and I again plead for the early payment of the claims made.

         —The Senate is debating three diesel fuel tax amendment Bills. Prior to the Budget, excise duty was payable for diesel fuel only if it was used on public roads but when the Budget was introduced on 17 August we were told of certain changes to the arrangements relating to the diesel fuel excise. Basically, the changes were that the excise on diesel fuel- which, including the extra levy, would be 6.155c per litre-would be payable by all users. Rebates were to be granted for certain off-road usage. We were told in the Budget that that usage would be in the agricultural, mining, fishing and forestry industries. Nursing homes would be able to obtain rebates and so would hospitals and aged persons' homes. Rebates would also be payable for certain domestic use.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I use this opportunity to level criticism at the Government for the inordinate delay in having this legislation passed. Senator Archer, who has just concluded speaking, also referred to this in his speech. This legislation was ignored by the Government as it grappled with problems of its own making. We should remember that the legislation was introduced on 17 August, the same day as the Budget was brought down, and it has taken over two months for it to get to this place for debate. As the Government has hung on to power over the last few weeks , its inaction with this legislation has resulted in thousands of dollars being withheld from primary producers and certain other organisations. It should be remembered that the excise on diesel fuel has been paid by, if I can call them this, exempt users since 17 August but no rebates have yet been paid, and no rebates will be paid for some time. The Government knew full well that rebates would not be paid until this legislation got through both Houses and then received royal assent. It may even be some time after that before the rebates are actually paid or, as Senator Archer says, are in the bank accounts of those who are eligible for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask why those eligible for a rebate should have to wait so long, or even have to wait so long to be able to apply for a rebate. It is now over two months since some of the people eligible for the rebate started to pay the excise. Many primary producers who can ill-afford it are providing to the Government over this time what is virtually an interest-free loan. They have paid the excise and they are waiting for their rebate but it looks like they will now have to wait until the beginning or middle of next month. I have been approached by some primary producers, as I suppose many honourable senators have, and they have justly asked why they should have to wait so long. I would like to read a letter which a primary producer in north Queensland sent to the former Minister for Industry and Commerce. He said:

        As you are aware your Government at Budget time changed the method for farmers to receive the distillate excise rebate. The Treasurer, at that time, stated that forms would be available to claim the rebate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The announcement was made on the 17th August, 1982 and it is now October and the forms are still not available. Have you any idea when the forms will be available in Cairns?
       </para>
       <para>

        If a Labor government had delayed rebates like this I expect that throughout the nation its members would have been pilloried. Yet this Government seems to have got away with holding back this money which is rightfully due to many primary producers and other organisations. This Government should not escape criticism for its lack of action and deserves severe censure for letting the legislation languish for so long in the House of Representatives without bringing it here so that it can be passed, the forms can be distributed-as the primary producer to whom I referred mentioned-and the primary producers can obtain their rebates.

        When I looked at this legislation I wondered whether the Government had thought through its new proposals properly. One cent of the 6.155c per litre excise is to be applied to the Bicentennial Road Development Program. Although that is the subject of a Bill that is yet to come before this chamber, it is worth mentioning that all non-road users of diesel fuel paying excise will be contributing to that program. This includes bakeries, dry cleaners and, as Senator Walsh said, even State railways. They will now be contributing to road development throughout Australia. That is a most peculiar situation. In fact, the managerial people in the various State railways do not think very much of the fact that they have to pay for road development in Australia. In Queensland I understand that the State railways will be paying about $2m towards road development. Next year, when the levy increases by another 1c per litre, they will be paying about $4m. I understand that the State railways have made submissions to the Government that they be exempt from this levy. I am not sure whether they have been exempted. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) may be able to clear up that matter when he replies.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that the excise measures were not properly thought through before their introduction. I have received many representations and Senator Archer, who spoke before me, mentioned that he has received many representations. I wish to mention three of those. First, a major shipping company in north Queensland contacted me. It enclosed a copy of a letter that it had sent to the Treasurer ( Mr Howard). The letter mentioned to the Treasurer that the new policy 'will dramatically offset the future viability of this company and the livelihood of its 200 plus employees who in the fiscal year 1981-82 contributed $1.7m in personal income tax to the Treasury'. This is a shipping company which many communities in north Queensland rely upon to bring goods to them on a regular basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter I wish to mention concerns a letter which I received from a member of Queensland Parliament. He outlined the difficulties facing local authorities in his area and mentioned the problems that a certain brickworks was going to face. I remember speaking to a shire chairman of a local authority in what one would call a near Brisbane area which, nevertheless, is in a rural area . The shire area is fairly small. The chairman mentioned to me a week and a half ago that about $9,000 extra would be payable by that shire because of the change in the diesel fuel excise policy. An amount of $9,000 might not sound much but to local authorities which have to eke out a living on a fairly limited income $ 9,000 is a considerable amount. Finally, I wish to read to the Senate a letter which outlines the difficulties which will be faced by one of the fuel distributors in Queensland. In a letter which the distributor wrote to the company from which he receives his oil he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Dear Sir,DIESEL FUEL REBATE SCHEME
       </para>
       <para>
        You will know that the former method of collecting duty using Fuel certificates ceased on the 18th August 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that it ceased on 17 August but 18 August is mentioned. The letter continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        You will also be aware that the new scheme imposes a dreadful financial burden on distributors and oil companies alike. I would like to offer you some figures taken from our business for the period 17th September, 1982.

       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the distributor was saying that normally $56.63 revenue would be collected but to collect the whole of the revenue, which has to be done before a rebate can be claimed, the amount of $6,522.15 had to be collected. Therefore, an unnecessary $6,465.52 was collected. The letter continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        Undoubtedly figure (6) will revert to the entitled people on application but in the meantime South Sea Enterprises Pty. Ltd. and Caltex will have paid this money to Federal funds. The hardship is that we have to pay this amount to Caltex for on-forwarding and the entire system ignores the fact that South Sea Enterprise Pty. Ltd. in the main are carrying some of this non-earning money on 30 day accounts. When we have borrowed money at a not inconsiderable interest and some of our customers take 120 days to pay one does not have to be Federal Treasurer to see trouble ahead. Immediately South Sea Enterprise Pty. Ltd.'s 1982/83 budget is in shambles. Can you suggest any remedy for the problem?
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly it is a significant problem for that company. As it says, its 1982-83 budget is in a shambles because of the problems the company is facing. It asked:
       </para>
       <para>
        Can you suggest any remedy for the problem?
       </para>
       <para>
        Short of a more understanding government being in power I do not know that I can suggest any remedy for that company's problem.

         —The diesel fuel tax legislation is among the least satisfactory to be introduced into this chamber for some time. I wish to briefly examine why this is so and then foreshadow some amendments that I will be moving on behalf of the Australian Democrats at the Committee stage. The Bills give legislative force to a Budget decision to abolish the exemption from excise duty of diesel fuel for all off-road use and the introduction in its place of a rebate for certain categories, as has been outlined by previous speakers. In effect, the Government has withdrawn the exemption from a huge range of users. In its place it has allowed the rebate to apply to only about 40 per cent of users. Therefore, many people will miss out.

         —The Government claims that the new administrative procedures will simplify the process of claiming the rebates. A ministerial statement released on 8 September announced that the adjustments were being made to reduce significantly the amount of information which users need to provide when claiming the rebate. One can only doubt whether this is so. Under the old exemption system the user had to apply for an exemption, and he had it until it was revoked. Under the new rebate system the user has to apply for the rebate on a regular basis. That means he will be continually called on to supply information to the Government to claim his rebate. As Senator Colston has already pointed out, because of the delay in getting this legislation through the Parliament many users have been, for two months or more, essentially financing the Government. They have not been able to apply for the rebate. They are paying the full excise to the Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The major problem with the Bills is this: The Government has not identified the people who will suffer as a result of this new legislation. No doubt this is politically very convenient for the Government. We have made extensive inquiries of the Government. I have asked a question in the Senate to which I have received no answer. We have not been able to get an answer from any official source as to what groups will be affected and to what degree they will be affected. This is an appalling state of affairs. The Government is about to raise a considerable amount of additional revenue that it cannot supply to this Parliament or to groups in the community that will be affected. The Government has claimed that it has had considerable trouble in the policing the old exemption system. One can well understand that it has had trouble. One would not be surprised when it has now become obvious that the Government has no idea where the money is coming from, or going to, so how on earth can officials monitor use or abuse?
       </para>
       <para>
        This lack of information, I suggest, is a critical problem not only in this case but also generally in the administration of the Government. For instance, when I introduced a Bill to exempt computer softwear from sales tax the Australian Taxation Office could not even guess at the cost of the Bill to revenue. One can only wonder what on earth is going on. Nevertheless, we have been able to find out that some groups will be very seriously affected, not the least the tourist industry, local government and the bakery industry. They will lose out very considerably if this legislation is passed in its present form. Probably through an oversight in drafting, as Senator Archer has already indicated, the fishing industry will be very seriously disadvantaged unless there is some amendment to this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        For these reasons one can say only that the estimates of revenue forgone by the Bill and the amount that the Treasury projects will be collected by the rebate are extremely suspect. I am informed by the Department of Industry and Commerce that it is not even known what the cost of this legislation will be to the railways. The Treasury estimates that the removal of the exemption will increase revenue by $304m in a full year and its replacement with the rebate will cost $ 128m in a full year. In other words only 42 per cent of fuel which would be exempt at present will attract the new rebate. However, given that no one knows who is benefiting from the exemption and how much of it went towards legitimate usage, Treasury estimates cannot really be relied upon. So we cannot help being unimpressed by a piece of legislation which the Government guesses might raise $ 160m this financial year but then again it might not. It depends on how accurately the Treasury has guessed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important point I wish to raise is this: This legislation is another example of a hidden tax on important users and it is typical of a deceptive approach to the raising of revenue as has been illustrated on two or three occasions already in this Budget. The Government has tried to sell its Budget as a give-away Budget, but what the Government is giving with one hand it is taking away with the other. We have to look only at the total tax revenue which the Government projects to raise in its Budget to see how obvious this is-this giving with one hand and taking away with the other. The projected increase in revenue to the Government from all sources in the Budget is 10.7 per cent. That is roughly in line with inflation. So the Government is raising another 10.7 per cent in revenue. In other words it is raising almost precisely the same amount of money in real terms this year as it raised last year. If honourable senators apply deflators they will find that that was true to the year before. In other words this Budget, the previous one and the one before that are exactly the same in their effect on the economy and in the total incidence of the burden of taxation on the people of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is just another example of a government masquerading as Father Christmas. When it is stripped down to the bare essentials we find that the Government is hard bitten, hard nosed and as cynical as ever. In the light of the dissatisfaction of this package of legislation with a great range of users of diesel fuel we propose to move amendments in the Committee stage which will widen the scope of the rebate that applies to local government bodies, to tourism, to industry in certain areas and to baking. At the request of the fishing industry we will also seek to amend the legislation so that the definition of 'user' will apply to fishing co-operatives and major fishing companies and processors.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to explain briefly the reasons for the projected amendments. Firstly, I will deal with local government. This is a multibillion dollar industry in this country and due to the paucity of information it is very difficult for us to assess accurately what effect this legislation will have on local government. But there is no doubt that it will be very considerable indeed . In effect this legislation will impose an additional tax directly on local government. It will do this at a time of considerable unemployment, at a time when it should be looking to local government to help solve the unemployment problem and create jobs. Instead of that it is applying an additional tax.

        Let us look at the tourist industry. There is no doubt that this legislation will have a dramatic impact on the tourist industry. Senator Archer raised that question insofar as it applies to Tasmania. We should bear in mind the fact that in 1980-81-these are the latest available reliable statistics that we can get hold of-foreign tourists spent $949m in Australia, almost 4 per cent of the total receipts on the current account of the balance of payments. That is a very considerable amount, and we do not see how those representations can be ignored. Is this Government to apply an additional tax on the tourist industry?

In 1973 he was charged with conspiracy involving tax avoidance in the United States but shortly before indictments were filed against him, he returned to Australia and obtained Australian citizenship. I received some evidence as to the means by which he did so. They were highly suspicious and obviously call for further investigation by the appropriate authorities.' (p. 236-7)
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian Federal Police investigation of the grant of citizenship to Mr Wainwright has not found any evidence that anyone involved in the processing of his application was aware of any adverse information at the material times (see answer to Question No. 2114) nor has any evidence been found of any criminal action by anyone in connection with the grant of that citizenship. The Attorney- General's Department has advised that there are no grounds for a prosecution against Mr Wainwright under the relevant provisions of the Australian Citizenship Act and consequently there are no grounds on which he could be deprived of his Australian citizenship. Should further information relevant to this matter emerge the case would be promptly and critically reviewed again.

       Australia has nominated several sites to be included on the World Heritage List . Three of these nominations have been accepted by the World Heritage Committee for inclusion in the World Heritage List. Two of these are of paramount Aboriginal significance and were selected for that reason. These are the Kakadu National Park (for the antiquity and quality of its Aboriginal rock art and archaeological sites) and the Willandra Lakes Region, which contains the earliest cremation evidence in the world, together with unique evidence of the early life of Australian Aboriginals. In addition there are other Aboriginal sites currently being recorded for preservation and possible inclusion on the World Heritage List.

       The series for imports of military equipment and stores was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics by making, wherever possible, balance of payments valuation, timing and coverage adjustments to overseas trade statistics . The series on the Commonwealth's overseas budget deficit is taken from various budget statements.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted that movements in the series for imports of military equipment and stores and in the Commonwealth's overseas budget deficit do not necessarily closely correspond. For example, large jumps are evident in the import data in 1973-74 and 1980-81, when Australia took delivery of major items of military equipment; however, corresponding increases are not evident in the Commonwealth's overseas budget deficit. This is because of the practice of making substantial advance payments in years prior to the delivery of major items of military equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thus, the proportions shown in the final column of the table are quite erratic and little significance can be accorded to the result in any particular year.
