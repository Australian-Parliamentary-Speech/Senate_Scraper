        —I inform the Senate of the sudden death on 9 November of Leonid Brezhnev, President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Australia was represented at the funeral of the late President Brezhnev in Moscow on 15 November by the former Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, accompanied by the Australian Ambassor to the Soviet Union, Mr Evans. In Australia President Brezhnev's death was marked by the normal practice of flying flags at half mast from public buildings on the day of the funeral. On 13 November the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony), on behalf of the Government, signed the condolence book at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra. His Excellency the Governor-General and the Acting Prime Minister sent condolence messages to the Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

      <para>
       In addition, I draw the attention of honourable senators to the Press statements issued by the Acting Prime Minister on 11 November and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) the following day. I do not wish to elaborate upon those statements and I believe it is too early to offer conclusive judgments about the policies likely to be followed by new leaders in Moscow, including Mr Andropov, who succeeds Mr Brezhnev as Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. In the short term at least it seems that there will be continuity of leadership and of policies well known to us. But the Government hopes that the new leadership of the Soviet Union by its future actions will commit itself to genuine co-operation with the West and to the removal of current obstacles to a constructive relationship between Australia and the Soviet Union.

        —by leave-I wish to associate the Opposition with the expressions of regret that the Government has made about the death of President Brezhnev of the Soviet Union. I do not wish to add much to what has been said by the Government except to say that President Brezhnev presided over the affairs of the Soviet Union for some 18 years. To attain the office of President and Secretary of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union is a great and rare achievement. To retain it for 18 years is perhaps an achievement of even greater memorability-if I may use that expression. All we would like to say is that through 18 very difficult years in international affairs and affairs in which the Soviet Union was intimately involved-in its relationships with both the West and China-President Brezhnev seemed to be a person who had a great capacity to keep his cool, given the very difficult circumstances in which the Soviet Government saw itself in its relationship with other countries. If that analysis is correct, it is a source of gratitude within the world that somebody of that temperament was in charge of the affairs of the Soviet Union through that period. We associate ourselves with the Government's response to the President's death.

        —by leave-I understand there is no normal motion of condolence before the Chair. Therefore, I thank the Senate for giving me leave to make some observations about the life and works of this person, Leonid Brezhnev. Brezhnev presided over the Soviet Union with ruthless and relentless power for 18 years, between 1964 and 1982. Repression was a basic tool of his government. All opposition was suppressed. Dissidents were treated subhumanely and expelled, and one can look to Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov, to mention two of many. Minorities had almost all human rights arbitrarily withdrawn. The treatment of Soviet Jews is something to be condemned, not just their repression but the despicable fact that many of them were not able to leave the Soviet Union even though they wished to. According to human rights investigations, four million people in the Soviet Union today are undergoing forced labour under the regime of this man and at least another 10,000 people are political prisoners.

       Perhaps one of the most deplorable and disgusting acts of this man and his colleagues was to gaol a man called Raoul Wallenberg, who has been incarcerated in Soviet psychiatric hospitals for 20 years. I will not refer to the foreign policy excursions initiated under this man. Let me conclude by saying for the record that it is a quaint habit we have in this place that when someone dies we look for good things or some things to say about them.

        —For that reason, responding to the interjection, it would be advisable for us to know, as the interjector implied, that the motion of condolence would not be carried. That would be a further mark of discredit to the Senate. I am astonished that the Senate should descend to so mean a level as it has, by way of comment and interjection, that on the death of a person we should enter into political criticism, criticism which would be subject to question in an ordinary debate.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       But let me move away from that and merely say some words in support of a person who has died. The Brisbane Courier-Mail, not the most radical of newspapers, had a headline concerning the late President Brezhnev, citing him as 'a calming voice in a volatile world'. In fact, on cool consideration of the matter, that is what Brezhnev was, a calming voice in a very volatile world. We are now entering into a period of great uncertainty. That uncertainty should concern us all. That uncertainty ought not to be added to by speeches such as the one by the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Chipp). When the great die the repercussions are considerable. The death of Brezhnev should make us listen and understand with greater concern than has been expressed in this place.
      </para>
      <para>
       My impression of Brezhnev is that he was a calming voice in a volatile world. In fact, historians will indicate that it was he and his advice that led the world from the brink of war at the time of the Cuban crisis. For that and that alone he should be given great credit. My interpretation from time to time of Brezhnev's speeches was that he sought in his own way peace and detente. In many ways he succeeded. If Brezhnev made decisions which led to the death of other people, it was because of a grim responsibility which heads of state have to bear. It is a grim responsibility that Thatcher had to bear in relation to the Falkland Islands and that Begin had to bear in relation to Lebanon. It was a grim responsibility that Menzies had to face when he committed men to Vietnam and that Whitlam had to face when he considered the crisis in Timor. Although we do not condone that, we should understand that responsibility. If we were to follow the theme that this Senate wishes to follow today the future of the world would be uncertain. In case honourable senators have other ideas, I remind them that Vice-President Bush said:
      </para>
      <para>
       We have come to declare to the Soviet leaders (and) to the Soviet people . . . that the United States is devoted to the pursuit of peace and a reduction of global tensions. We seek a world of greater harmony, not only between the two great superpowers, but for all nations. It is our fervent hope that today's massive expenditures for arms can be reduced and that the world's standard of living, especially for the impoverished, can be greatly improved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Fears, suspicions and distrust must be replaced by hope, by trust, by mutual co -operation. The barriers that now divide nations and regions can be dismantled and discarded.
      </para>
      <para>
       This spirit of hope . . . is with us all.
      </para>
      <para>
       This spirit of hope was with me until this debate started today in the Senate. Having listened to Senator Chipp and interjections, I believe that the achievement of this spirit of hope is now questionable. If this is the way in which this spirit is being expressed, we are in serious trouble. Getting back to Brezhnev, it is to be hoped that all the good for which Brezhnev stood will live after him. I trust that that will be so.

        —by leave-On an occasion such as this it is usual for the Senate to hear from the leaders of the major parties. I would have left it at that but for various interjections and statements that flowed in response to what Senator Georges was just saying. I believe that all honourable senators care about the death of every individual in the world and that we all have a natural sympathy for anyone who dies. But Senator Georges should not have built upon that natural sympathy to make the remarks that he just made which I believe are not representative of the Senate. I believe that Senator Chipp's words summarise fairly and accurately the views of the majority of honourable senators from all parties. We should not run away at a time like this from recognising that a tyrant has ruled in a major country of the world. We have had debates in the Senate about Czechoslovakia, about Afghanistan, about Poland and about civil rights in the Soviet Union. At this time are we to deny the conclusions that have been reached in the Senate on those matters? I think former Senator John Wheeldon would have spoken most clearly and crisply on behalf of all of us if he had been here today. He put down a parliamentary report on human rights in the Soviet Union which shows that there is enormous tragedy in that country which developed during the time of this man's leadership . There will not be a vote on this matter in the Senate, but let it not pass that in my mind, at least, I believe Senator Chipp has spoken accurately for all of us.

        —When giving notice of disallowance, on 12 October 1982, of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations (Amendment), I informed the Senate that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee had raised with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) the possibility that matters contained in regulation 146AJ (5C), which deals with immunity of the Commonwealth and its returning officers from defamation proceedings, were of such substance that they might more appropriately be the subject of an Act of Parliament rather than of delegated legislation. I also indicated that the Committee had asked the Minister and the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown ), whether the regulation-making power provided in sections 133AA and 198 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 was wide enough to authorise the making of the regulation in question. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided detailed reasons for conferring the immunity by regulation, and has assured the Committee that section 133AA of the Act does provide adequate statutory authority for the regulation in question. The Committee has accepted the explanation and assurance.

       When giving notice, also on 12 October 1982, for the disallowance of Regulation 48B of the Postal Services Regulations, I indicated that the Committee was awaiting advice from the Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown) as to why a right of notification to senders and addresses that certain objects had been destroyed by postal authorities had not been included in the Regulation. The Minister has now advised that internal arrangements make provision for such notification to be made to the sender, if identifiable, or to the addressee. In the light of the advice, and in view of the comprehensive nature of the Postal Services Regulations as a whole, the Committee had decided not to pursue the matter further.

         —It is a misunderstanding of the Government's policy announcement to draw such conclusions. I do not say that in a negative sense. The fact is that the Government is facing a situation in which high wages, particularly the wage rises in the last year, have caused huge rises in costs compared with other competing countries and have resulted in unemployment. The costs themselves are, in their true nature, the costs of labour; that is, the cost of wages. The main thrust to get down interest rates is to bear down on inflation. To bear down on inflation one must bear down upon on the fundamental ingredient of inflation, which is wage costs.

         —Despite the interjections of the Opposition, the fact is that every other country in the free world facing this situation in a world- wide recession has come to the conclusion that the primary task is to bring about a condition of major wage restraint. Every other country in the free world has so comported itself that there has been substantial wage restraint including , in some cases, a lowering of wages. The aim of the Government is primarily to reduce costs so as to reduce inflation and, by so doing, to give future opportunities in Australia-as the recession moves away in the world-for Australian industries to take their opportunities to move outwards in greater job creation in the natural sense of recovery. The primary objective is to beat inflation, and in beating inflation create opportunities for more healthy jobs, and to reduce interest rates.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is equally a misunderstanding to look at the question of job creation in this context. It is true that a Labor Minister of old said that one man's wage increase was another man's job. The Opposition runs away from that now. The fact of the matter is that if we can get wage restraint, if we can get a wage freeze, we can stop further major drifts of disemployment. That is devoutly hoped. To use a figure of $700m is to fail to understand the situation. The Government's aim is that the wage freeze should be not only in the Commonwealth, State and local government areas but throughout the community. Taken throughout the community this would in fact result in several billion dollars at least of wage savings. Put in its context, the figuring Senator Button has done is quite inaccurate. The Government is aiming to get the inflation rate down so that jobs can be created for the future as the world moves out of recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is asking that there should be wage restraint throughout the whole community so there is no need for further disemployment, so there is a reduction of losses in industry, so there is not a collapse of industry and so that profitability returns and, therefore, job creation can be further developed . This principle has been adopted by virtually every country in the free world. The countries in the free world have all borne down on wages to get their inflation down and have got their inflation down below that of Australia. Unless we can get our inflation into a competitive condition with other countries, when the recovery commences we will be at a disadvantage. We do not intend to be so.

         —Let me take up this question because I think it is a serious one that requires a detailed answer. Firstly, as I have said in a previous answer, the ingredients of all costs in the end are the costs of labour that go towards making a particular material or providing a particular service. In the end the cost of labour is the vital factor in creating high costs and therefore high inflation. Consequently, the Commonwealth Government is seeking wage restraint. It is competent for any State government that so desires-the States have the powers; the Commonwealth does not-to do all those other things that Senator Georges mentioned. If State governments desire to bring about price regulation or any other regulations they are the sovereign governments and it is for them so to do. The Commonwealth makes the point--

I remind the Senate once again-this was the thesis of Mr Hayden in his 1975 Budget; I have not heard it altered since-that the way back to re-employment is to bear down on inflation because inflation creates unemployment. To bear down on inflation is the path back. I commend the rereading of Mr Hayden's 1975 Budget Speech to the Senate.

For example, we would agree with the need for greater equality of opportunity for all schools and some of the special programs which are contained within that kind of commitment. We would agree with the commitment to improve resources for children in the most needy non-government schools. That is our policy now.

We believe every school child in Australia, whether attending a government or a non-government school, is entitled to a certain basic level of support. Our policies promise this. The policies proposed by the Labor Party do not. In fact, they say quite specifically that some Australian children will not get any basic level of support. As I understand the Labor Party policy as it was set out at its biennial conference and as I read the statements which followed it, in spite of the twisting and turning by the shadow Minister in the last week or two, my estimate is that something like 96,000 Australian children will lose any entitlement to government support if this policy is applied. The Labor Party is sensitive about this issue because after the National Times last week published what was called a hit list I noticed that the shadow Minister wrote in the following week to say that there was no hit list. It then turned out that the list had been supplied to Mr Geoff Kitney by the Labor Party.

The present Government gives more money in real terms, after allowing for inflation, to support the running costs in government schools. It is giving more this year, it gave more last year and it will give more next year than was given in the last year of the Labor Government. The claim that we have abandoned government schools is patently untrue. I come back to where I began and say that the many areas of agreement give a good basis for a bipartisan approach to do what is really necessary in education-that is, to improve outcomes for Australian children wherever they are. To the extent that we can work on that bipartisan arrangement we will do so. But in areas where we disagree and where we think the policy that has been proposed will diminish the opportunities for Australian children, we will oppose it and we will continue to espouse what we believe to be just and reasonable policies.

The Minister will be aware that 13 December is D-day for the Franklin River World Heritage List nomination.

         —The Government made very substantial provision in the Budget for capital works. For example, the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program is of enormous significance. Soon the Senate will have legislation before it in regard to that program. The Budget provides for very substantial public works in regard to airfields, water resources programs and other constructions. The Government is endeavouring to ensure that it can get effective control of inflation-that is, deflation-and provide effective opportunities for job creation without substantially inflating deficits. That ought to warm the hearts of members of the Australian Labor Party because until recently it was Mr Hayden's thesis that we must not substantially enlarge the deficit or we will create unemployment and inflation. I repeat that the Government's aim is to bear down on wages and therefore to bear down on costs, at the same time recognising that in the government sphere-Commonwealth, State and local government-there could be a saving of $700m and in the private sector there could be a saving of at least another $2 billion and that as those savings would not be inflationary, because they would not cause an increase in the deficit, they could be used to put people to work in an effective way without causing inflation. It would be job insurance, job creation, in the best sense and would not result in disemployment by blowing out the deficit.

       <para>
        The figure of $700m is not, in itself, a figure on which we should be bearing. I pointed that out in answer to Senator Button. The Government aims to get a wages freeze right across the board, throughout commerce and industry and throughout the services or tertiary sector so that much more money can be put to work, in a deflationary sense, to save existing jobs, to restore profitability to industries that would otherwise disemploy and in fact to prepare for the future so that, as the recession rolls back, Australia will be in a competitive position in regard to other countries. That is the primary thrust of the Government's approach. It makes very good sense and it ought to be supported by all Australians.

         —That was not the question at all. The question was whether we had an adequate public works structure in the Budget. I replied that the Budget provided for a substantial amount of public works. Since the Budget was presented, because of a rapid fall-off in overseas purchases from Australia and a rapid rise in wages, there has been a more severe rate of disemployment than the Government or anyone else foreshadowed. It therefore became necessary to get to the very heart of that problem, which is recognised by all economists in the country as being the upsurge of wages, which have risen by something like 17 1/2 per cent. Unless wages can be restrained costs cannot be restrained and if costs cannot be restrained we will have disemployment running very fast. The logical thing to do is to bear down on inflation. That, in turn, will bear down on interest rates. The Budget gave to every family very substantial extra support by way of family allowances, tax concessions, housing interest rate subsidies and a variety of concessions in the sense that it aimed to get wage restraint. This is a further step in that regard. Incidentally, it is supported in very many parts of industry where employees-decent Australian workers-on their own initiative are coming forward to employers and offering, whether by way of a four day working week or the restraint of wages, to do precisely what this Government is aiming to do today.

         —I am grateful for Senator Walsh's help. Senator Bolkus asked whether I heard the Western Australian Premier this morning; I did. As to wages and prices, the first thing I repeat is that the cost-that is, the price- of anything is the labour of its production. Therefore, of course, prices bear a direct and enormous relationship to wages. Equally, if the cost of labour is such that an industry becomes unprofitable, the industry sheds labour. If we have unprofitable industry, we get disemployment. So the way to bear down primarily on costs is to bear down on wages. I repeat that if the Western Australian Premier, or any other Premier, seeks, within his sovereign powers, to do what is within the constitutional power of the States with regard to prices or charges, he is entirely free to do so. I remind Senator Bolkus that the people of Australia have never agreed that there should be centralised price control within the Commonwealth. They say that price control should remain within the States, where it rests now. So this matter is entirely a matter for the States.

        The real thrust of the matter is whether the people of Australia are willing, through Commonwealth, State and local government and through commerce, industry and services, to get major wage restraint now so that we can get to the very heart of inflation as quickly as possible. That is what this discussion is working on. Basically, it is capable of achievement if there is good will. But members of the Australian Labor Party are setting out now to try to destroy it. Nothing could be more un-Australian than setting out to destroy something that is aimed at stopping disemployment and at creating future employment in Australia. The knockers themselves are destructive. I only hope that they will get together and say to themselves: 'Let us have a bipartisan policy in this country'-the employment of Australian families ought to be a bipartisan matter-' and let us get together with constructive, sensible and decent support for the government of the day, which is trying to do the vital things that are recognised in other countries as necessary'.

         —There was no reluctance at all. The conditions of disemployment in this country today are obviously more serious than they were in 1977. The world has gone into a much harsher recession this year than there was in 1977. The impact externally upon Australia is now much vaster. I would take it that there is far greater realisation by every Australian-by every Australian government and by the community outside-that if we are to resist this recession, if we are to get back into a competitive stance for the future, this is the real issue now. I just hope that members of the Labor Party will stop being knockers and get on with the job of helping Australia to recover.

Bearing in mind that on a percentage comparison with other States Tasmania has the least number of students going through to matriculation year-Tasmania averaging 26.7 per cent compared with the mainland figure of 34.8 per cent-does the Minister expect the retention rate in Tasmania to improve markedly as a result of the Secondary Allowances Scheme?

         —The extension of the scheme to which Senator Walters referred is a Budget initiative in which the means test for the Secondary Allowances Scheme has been extended by 44 per cent-a very major extension of the means test. The result of that will be to allow a large number of parents to qualify who would not otherwise have qualified. It has the potential to enable a large number of students to remain at school and their families to receive some support which they could not have received earlier. It is desirable that that benefit be publicised. I seem to recall that in this place earlier-I think it may have been Senator Grimes in relation to the housing proposals-there was some criticism of the fact that not enough publicity was given when that scheme was extended. We thought it appropriate to make known this new benefit so that as many potential recipients as possible at this stage of the year, could consider whether they should apply. We have started a campaign. It began with some radio commercials. We have established a hot line in each capital city and in the country. Rather contrary to our expectations-we thought it might start slowly- large numbers of telephone calls have been received from the first day from people anxious to discover whether they, as parents, might qualify for the benefit. To the extent that the campaign is bringing information it will be very helpful.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, the scheme will apply Australia-wide. It will apply in Tasmania as it will apply anywhere else. I cannot say with any certainty that such a scheme would be the major determinant of any increased retention of students. It would certainly help in working towards increased retention-the same as any other increased benefit might help by removing financial barriers. To the extent that all the parties in the Parliament are seeking increased retention, this benefit is one that should be supported on all sides. It may be difficult to measure in Tasmania or in any other part of Australia exactly what beneficial effects will flow. I cannot guarantee to Senator Walters that we can tell her that such and such a number of students remain in secondary schools who would not otherwise have remained. If we know that those students in years 11 and 12 who are entitled to help have made contact with the Department, have received advice from officers and hopefully that all parents able to receive the benefit are in fact receiving it, then we as a government will be well satisfied.

I could get a breakup of the figure of approximately $700m that was mentioned, but as far as the Commonwealth is concerned it would not claw back personal tax out of it.

         —I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. A number of areas in Western Australia are now drought declared and qualify for direct Commonwealth assistance by way of interest and fodder subsidies. The fodder subsidy is not for agistment when stock are taken to areas where feed is available but is available if the feed is taken to the stock. Agistment is not a practical option for the eastern mainland States where there are so few areas where any surplus grazing capacity exists but it would be the best option for most drought areas in Western Australia. The main advantages of agistment are that weeds are not spread in the hay and grain and most of the wheat belt is enjoying an excellent season. Also, it is now lightly stocked because of drought in recent years. Because the direct Commonwealth drought assistance seems to contain a bias against Western Australian farmers and because it encourages bad farming practices, would the Government consider widening its provision to include assistance for agistment? The term 'stubbles' is included in category 3 of the list of fodder which will attract a subsidy. Any farmer will confirm that 'stubble' is a term used to describe the remains of a harvested crop standing in a paddock.

         —There are two aspects of the question. The honourable senator asked whether the Government would consider widening the provision for fodder assistance to include agistment. He correctly pointed out that the drought relief measures announced by the Government do not cover the costs of agisting sheep or cattle, instead of purchasing fodder for feeding to them on the home property. I will put that request to the Minister for Primary Industry for his consideration. I would say, in undertaking to do that, that the announced drought relief measures are extremely generous already in the sense that they respond to the very real problems which exist because of the widespread nature of the drought. It is an unusual situation in that so much of rural Australia is in drought. For that reason, of course, agistment is simply not available in many parts of Australia. Many people who wish to retain their breeding stock will need to purchase fodder, and for that reason the Government was responding to the particular and difficult circumstances of this widespread drought.

       <para>
        It is true that the expression 'stubbles' appears in the advertisement. However , it is made quite clear in the application form that no assistance is provided for agistment. The expression 'stubbles' appears with a series of other words which clearly relate to fodder which has been removed from the ground. I think on a proper reading of the advertisement it would be understood that the stubble referred to is of the harvested, baled and delivered variety. I think anyone who got to the point of making an application and who read the application form would see that agistment on stubble or whatever is not covered by this scheme.

The fact is that the States already have that constitutional power. If it is thought , after consultation between the Commonwealth and the States, that the appropriate way to proceed in this matter is by way of some form of statutory control on wages, that could in fact be achieved. So if we were to get a co- operative approach between the States and the Commonwealth the point raised by Senator Foreman would not be a point of concern at all. The Commonwealth's reservation with respect to seeking the constitutional power referred to by the honourable senator is rooted in its conviction that the Australian Labor Party would probably use such a power to extraordinarily ill-effect and to the great detriment of this country. It has never been the view of honourable senators on this side of the chamber that that is a power which should be vested in the Commonwealth Government.

        In this case we are approaching the matter knowing that a significant number of employees in different areas have acknowledged the need for wage restraint. Notwithstanding the very disturbing increase in the rate of earnings over the last six months, some groups within the community have shown themselves to be concerned about the economic position of their companies and their employers and have been prepared to come to co-operative arrangements. The Government hopes that that spirit is widespread in the Australian community. At a time when there are significant difficulties in this community we should be prepared to work together to achieve a solution which will spread the benefits of this very great country more equitably among the people who inhabit it.

        I can advise the honourable senator that I have seen the story in the Age newspaper of 15 November.

       <para>
        The Commonwealth has, for some years, had under consideration the question of medical manpower, the levels of immigration, the levels of foreign-trained as opposed to Australian-trained doctors. The difficulty is to determine the economics of the medical market place. Does in fact a market model exist so that more doctors means keener competition, with benefits? There is some evidence of this. The same report from the researchers shows, for example, that at the same time as there has been an increase of doctors a better distribution of medical manpower has emerged. Many doctors have moved into areas which were previously underprovided. The other model of the medical market-place is a cost generated model which suggests that more doctors mean higher costs. Depending upon which of those models one believes is the correct one, one will make one or other decision on what one does about medical manpower and its control. Government has been considering this matter. It has not wanted to interfere more intensively at the Commonwealth level. But we are concerned and we will put these figures under study. I will seek from the Minister for Health any further comment he may wish to offer.

        On the economic front, inflation is this nation's most menacing enemy. We aim to curb it. Unless this aim is achieved, the nation's productive capacity will run down and job opportunities will diminish.

        Our present level of unemployment is too high. If we fail to control inflation unemployment will get worse.

        He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        We are no longer operating in that simple Keynesian world in which some reduction in unemployment could, apparently, always be purchased at the cost of some more inflation. Today, it is inflation itself which is the central policy problem. More inflation simply leads to more unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then went on to say that this problem could not be solved by increasing the deficit. Honourable senators should remember what he said. He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        Some might argue that a large deficit could be offset by a tough monetary policy-but this would mean greatly increased interest rates, disruption in financial markets, further depression of business confidence and serious company failures. This is an unacceptable option.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, Mr Hayden, in his 1975 Budget Speech, said the very things that this Government is saying today: If we want to tackle unemployment and reduce it we must tackle inflation. We cannot tackle inflation by inflating the Budget-Mr Hayden said this and we agree-if we enlarge the deficit we enlarge unemployment. The key to inflation is costs. Rising costs are the cause of higher inflation. Higher costs are caused by higher wages. The Australian Labor Party now finds itself in an enormous dilemma. To take the negative and destructive line that it is now taking it must reject what its leader said when he was Treasurer. He was right when he was Treasurer. He is now changing the whole of his thesis. The truth of the matter is that more inflation means more unemployment. Bearing down on inflation means that we are on the way to tackling the employment problem. I only hope that members of the Labor Party will go back to Mr Hayden's Budget Speech and read it more often.

Senator Grimes put that as part of his question. I imagine that the Department of Health has existing arrangements to cover that situation. I will undertake to find out what those are. Basically, the Government is concerned to ensure that those who get the new concessional prescription cost are those who are entitled to it.

I am advised that the Outpost Radio Service VJY is currently located in the Darwin Post Office telegraph section. This is unsatisfactory because of noise and its inadequate size. Staff representations on these points go back 18 months. Phonogram operators handle the traffic during the day and telegraphists handle it during the night. Some time ago Telecom Australia introduced an arrangement whereby outpost radio stations could make telephone calls by having VJY operators connect the radio link into the telephone network. This operated until 9 o' clock each night and it proved very satisfactory. After that hour there was very little traffic except meteorological messages which have hitherto been handled by telegraphists as telegrams. Telecom now wants to make those into telephone calls by connecting directly through to the Weather Bureau at Darwin. The telegraphists union is not happy about this.

        Associated with Telecom's preference to move away from telegrams to telephone calls for VJY traffic is a plan to locate VJY in the Telephone Manual Assistance Centre, Darwin-a different location. All traffic would then be handled not by the telegrapists union but by a different union, I think the Australian Telephone and Phonogram Officers Association. Telecom is still in negotiation with the unions but without resolution.

I inform the Senate, however, that a Queensland Order in Council published in the Queensland Government Gazette of 17 March 1973 includes within the reserve the islands named by Senator Macklin in his question. I also advise the Senate that the Queensland Minister, Mr Tomkins, is reported to have said when speaking on the Nationwide program in Brisbane recently that all land that had been identified by his Department as reserve land would be included in the deeds of grant in trust. The Senate will recall that on 14 October I informed the Parliament of a letter that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had sent to Senator Bonner on this matter. It is recorded in Hansard at page 1446. That letter included an undertaking by the Commonwealth to provide access to legal advice for community councils which may want to check what is proposed for inclusion in the deeds of grant in trust.

The alleged frauds are a matter to be pursued between the international airlines as principals and the agents they have appointed to sell travel on their services. The airlines have a normal commercial responsibility to ensure that they recover from their agents the full amount associated with their ticket sales. I understand that airlines have already taken steps to counter those fraudulent practices-for example, travel agents have been instructed that they should collect from passengers the fares applicable for travel from Australia. I understand that as a result of those and other actions by airlines the practice has diminished substantially.

Therefore, the topic of today's matter of public importance-the failure of the Government's economic policies and the continuation of high interest rates-is one which will be looked at with interest by many people in this country. It is clear that the Government has lost control of the situation. We all know that the Government has failed in its stated objective of the last six or seven years to take politics off the front page of newspapers.

        To begin with let me remind honourable senators that the Fraser Government took office seven years ago and promised to reduce interest rates, to reduce inflation and to reduce unemployment. We know that that statement was made with a great amount of flourish. In the subsequent seven years a great deal of rhetoric has attempted to cover up that flourish and that promise. Today we have high and rising rates of interest. The official Commonwealth bond rate is now 13 1/2 per cent. We are faced with a higher and continuing increase in the rate of inflation and of course we have record unemployment-double what it was when this Government came to power. The Government has failed in its stated aims. It has not met up with the task it has set itself. The Government has had its chance and it has failed. In other words, it has muffed it; it has stuffed it.

        Last Thursday the Senate recalled the events of November 1975. In that debate there was some reference to the economic position of the Liberal Party and the Country Party at the time. I would like briefly to review that position again. By looking at the statements and claims of the then Opposition and comparing them with today's realities we can get a better picture of the failure of the Government's performance and the hypocrisy of Government members. I only need remind the Senate of the rhetoric and the distortion of facts which are so characteristic of Senator Sir John Carrick. I will seek leave at a subsequent moment to incorporate the documents from the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library which show that in September 1975 the inflation rate was 0 .7 per cent. What is the inflation rate in 1982 in the same period, the end of September? It is 3.4 per cent. The annual rate in the September period in 1975 showed a 12 per cent inflation rate. What is it today? It is 12.3 per cent. This is the sort of distortion we have had in the Senate over that period by Senator Sir John Carrick and his confreres. What did the then Opposition claim in 1975? Senator Chaney, then a very junior senator but now a senior member of the Government, when speaking to the 1975 Labor Budget, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that every Budget has to be looked at in the economic context, and the economic context of this Budget is very clear. It is a context of very high inflation, a rate at which this Government ought to be . . . ashamed and it is in the context of a level of unemployment of which this Government is, I am sure , ashamed. When one looks at those two factors-the factors of inflation and unemployment-one can see that this Budget is critically important to all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then Senator Carrick, speaking in the same debate, told us:
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget is a self-defeating document in that it says inflation is too high and unemployment is too high but at the end of this year they will both be higher still.
       </para>

        Senator Chaney's and Senator Carrick's contributions could well have been describing the 1982-83 Budget. I will return to this matter later. Senator Carrick also told the chamber that interest rates were too high. Exaggerating quite a bit, he said that 'they were 11 per cent or 12 per cent'. They were, in fact, much lower. The Commonwealth bond rate was about 8 per cent in the second half of 1975. This was unacceptably high for Senator Carrick at the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to a debate on a matter of urgency about interest rates led by then Senator Cotton in this House. This was the matter of urgency raised by Senator Cotton:
       </para>
       <para>
        The imposition by the Government of the highest and most onerous interest rates since Federation.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was referring to interest rates of 8.5 per cent. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        That has affected the whole economic and interest rate scene. . . . It has increased costs quite unnecessarily . . . and made home ownership more difficult .
       </para>
       <para>
        How then can this Government talk about its policies working when we have an interest rate which is now almost 50 per cent higher than it was when those resolutions were moved in 1974 and 1975? All economic observers, no matter what their political shade, identify all of these elements. Those elements are high rates of interest, a high rate of inflation and a high unemployment rate. These were considered to be the definitions of Government failure in 1975. What are they today? They are exactly the same in today's economic crisis. The Syntec newsletter, not usually sympathetic to a Labor viewpoint, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Both short and long term interest rates are currently under upward pressure, which we expect to continue in the near term.
       </para>
       <para>
        It adds:
       </para>
       <para>
        The deterioration in the real economy will force the Fraser Government to go through to late 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        The latest economic report of the Hill Samuel organisation suggests that short term interest rates are likely to remain under upward pressure. The INDECS group , stressing that Commonwealth bonds are now marketed by tender and are therefore subject to speculative and market pressures, stated the picture fairly clearly, saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent interest rate gyrations have been fascinating . . . Commonwealth bond yields have moved from 14 per cent to 12 per cent and back to 14 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        INDECS noted, however, that these shifts are largely due to speculative pressures as a result of the new bond tendering system recently introduced by the Fraser Government. It went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the present case, flights of speculative fancy were grounded by the news of the (recent 3.5 per cent) CPI increase and fears that inflation was picking up. Inflation will continue to be an important influence on interest rates in the short term.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, let us look at what the economic experts think. The Melbourne University Institute for Applied Economic and Social Research reviewed the 1982- 83 Budget in a way which echoes the comments of Senator Sir John Carrick and Senator Chaney in 1975. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Credit conditions will remain tight and interest rates are unlikely to fall.
       </para>
       <para>
        Its 1982 summary went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a contractionary Budget. It foreshadows a domestic surplus at a time when the economy is operating far below full employment. The fact that the overall deficit is estimated to increase and the domestic surplus to decrease . . . reflects the sharp slowing in the interest rate of growth of output this year rather than an easing in the policy stance. This is an inflationary Budget. It will add impetus to the rate of inflation directly when increases in taxes and excise duties are passed on to consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the prospect facing this country in the December quarter. Commentators, right, left and centre, all bemoan the current economic situation. They have no time at all for the Government's response. The current situation is characterised by unemployment of 539,200 people or 8.2 per cent of the work force in seasonally adjusted terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        Internal predictions of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations suggest that unemployment will reach 9.75 per cent to 10 per cent by February. Others say that it could go as high as 12 per cent and that in some regions of Australia it could reach 20 per cent or 25 per cent within the next few months. Inflation after the September quarter is running at over 12.3 per cent annually. Interest rates at the low end are 14 per cent and at the higher end-trading bank lending rates-they are 17 per cent to 18 per cent. Savings bank mortgage rates for home loans have moved from 9.5 per cent in March 1980 to 13.5 per cent currently. Mortgage finance from New South Wales permanent building societies is currently available at between 14 per cent and 16 per cent. This dramatic increase in interest rates is affecting not only the home building industry but also small businesses generally as well as the average citizen in our country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The one glimmer of hope in recent months on the economic front was the slight reduction in interest rates. That has now passed as but a brief hiccup. Since then rates have been back on the increase. The level of interest rates has a real effect. The most obvious area of effect is in the housing sector. The housing industry has been in a state of paralysis for some time. The decrease in the amount of money available to housing in 1980, 1981 and 1982 is a measure of the degree to which this has affected the Australian economy. Building activity is down, jobs are being wasted and families cannot afford homes. Recent indicators of the decline are the 20.4 per cent drop in lending for housing from banks and other financial institutions between July 1981 and July this year-that is, from $7,470m to $6,506m-and the drop in building approvals. High interest rates will help to fuel inflation too. A circle of inflation pushing interest rates which in turn pushes inflation may well be soon operating.
       </para>
       <para>
        The pressures of high overseas interest rates will work to keep up the domestic rate-it is pretty obvious that they will remain high overseas-thereby avoiding a balance of payments problem. There is no point in our ignoring the fact that we are tied to an international system. The Opposition accepts this is a problem but it is not one that can be accepted as a fait accompli as the Government has done, which says that we have to accept it and work in that world environment. The situation is tragic for hundreds of thousands of Australian people. All observers and honourable senators know that. Yet the Government's official spokesman on economic matters seems blissfully unaware of this. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, in his euphoria, perhaps at playing as Prime Minister, a few days ago opened the Liberal Party campaign for the by-election for the seat of Flinders with a confirmation of Government policy. This was the same position as the one put by the Treasurer in the House of Representatives on 14 October in reply to a debate initiated by the honourable member for Gellibrand, Mr Willis, our spokesman. The Treasurer pointed to the problems of the recession, which he finally admitted is taking place, and said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is only if we are prepared to tackle those problems, to see the distance, and to persevere and not stop and go with anti-inflationary policies that we will ultimately have a hope of returning to conditions of sustained economic growth. Anybody who believes that those realities can be put aside and that we can indulge ourselves in the luxury of some expansion and monetary and fiscal laxity in policy and not see the consequences has not read the economic history of the Western world over the last 10 or 15 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer ignored the fact that those influences existed in the period between 1972 and 1975. The Treasurer's appeal sounds remarkably akin to the appeal of President Reagan of the United States of America of a few months back to stay the course, or Mrs Thatcher's statement in the United Kingdom, that the lady is not for turning. The Treasurer must not have read the economic and political history of the Western world of the last few months, otherwise he would not be pursuing the outmoded and inadequate policies to which he is blindly sticking. He would not be putting forward Mr Reagan's monetarism as a positive example, as he did elsewhere in his speech of 14 October and repeated in the Flinders by-election campaign. If the Treasurer had been reading the economic and political history of the Western world in recent times she would know that Mr Reagan has abandoned his stated policies in favour of more jobs creating and expansionary policies. The very question that Mr Reagan has taken up is one which the Australian Labor Party is putting forward as a positive contribution to the economic difficulties currently facing us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Howard will know that the American people recently shifted their votes away from President Reagan's hard right line in favour of the Democratic Party candidates who have been advocating-as we have been in the Labor Party-among other things, job creation and controls on interest rates and charges. Mr Howard is moving in precisely the other direction-the wrong direction; the direction that will lead to even higher inflation, unemployment and interest rates. He led the push in Cabinet against job creation and he is leading the push in favour of the Campbell recommendation for deregulation of the finance system. If we are to believe the newspapers of this country we can draw the inference that no front bench member is prepared to debate this matter in the Parliament today because he does not support the policies pursued by Mr Howard when he was able to get majority support for his viewpoint in the Cabinet. Deregulation of the finance system would place interest rates even more at the mercy of speculative and market related ups and downs than is currently the case. That is a matter to be fought and regretted. Deregulation would be a chaotic disaster for Mr and Mrs Average Australia. I stress to the Senate that the Australian people are not interested in giving this Government any longer to pursue the policies which for seven years it has failed to deliver. I am sure that the vote in the electorate of Flinders will show this.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has been the matter with the Government over the last several months? There have been shorter sessions of Parliament in the House of Representatives; speculation about an early election; no policies in respect of the economic difficulties facing this country; and changes to the way in which the Budget is prepared. Yet this Government suggested that some consideration should be given to an early election in 1982. It wants another three years in office when it has failed dismally over the last seven years to carry out the promises it made in such a flourish of rhetoric in 1975, 1977 and 1980.It is a failed Government, an inept Government, a passive Government and an inefficient Government. Yet it wants to have the support of the Australian people for another three years to carry on its policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand Labor, through the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and its three State Premiers, is providing an alternative approach. It is a short term emergency alternative to cope with the mess created by the Fraser Government and a longer term approach. It is an approach based upon rational intervention and planning in the economy. It does not allow the free play of the so-called free marketeers to take hold. In regard to interest rates, Labor rejects the proposal for the deregulation of the financial system. It is committed to a process of regulation and reform. Announcing rejection of the deregulatory recommendations of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System in itself would remove one of the pressures for higher interest rates-the mere expectation that deregulation will lift them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, there is a need for an overhaul of the financial system, as the Campbell Committee noted. Labor is committed to such an overhaul but not to the leave it to the market approach placed upon the financial system within the context of an overall approach to monetary, fiscal and general economic policy. Labor intends to plan for growth and employment. An approach which allows interest rates to rise and, therefore, credit to tighten will not assist growth in any sphere, be it in housing, small business or manufacturing. All of those sectors are groaning under the policies being pursued by this Government. Rates must be adopted to allow borrowing for socially and economically productive investment. Jobs can come only from this sort of approach. It is an approach that I would commend to the Government as an alternative to its current head in the sand, stay on the course approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate that the housing industry should be seen as a self-starter in the economy. The housing industry should be seen as a sector of the economy which has the capacity not only to employ labour but also to have a multiplier effect to regenerate the very important sections of the Australian economy that are needed to create jobs, growth and development. Surely it is not essential for us to continue with the same course of action which has been followed so blindly by this Government and which has been shown, even in the consideration of the Budget documents, to be completely inadequate and unable to reach the depth of the problems facing Australia. The Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development has referred to the fact that Australia is beset with domestic problems which have to be accepted in this country. The direction of those economic policies has to be changed. It is a matter of importance that we know where the Government stands on these issues and that we ask the Government to indicate what its policies are. The Australian people are waiting for such a response, knowing full well that we are faced with the most difficult economic circumstances this country has seen in recent years. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the tables which have been prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library from information supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

         —The matter we are debating reads:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The failure of the Government's economic policies and the continuation of high interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is properly described as a matter of public importance. It is undoubtedly a matter of the very greatest importance. The trouble is that members of the Opposition do not have anything very important to say on it. They keep on bringing up the same sorts of remarks believing, I think like Mr Toad of Toad Hall, that they said it once, they said it twice, they said it thrice and, therefore, it must be true. Of course, it is not true. It contains a large number of gross misconceptions. The learning curve of members of the Opposition in economic matters is a horizontal straight line. I would like to point out just some of these gross misconceptions which were revealed in Senator Gietzelt' s speech. The first relates to interest rates. Interest rates are the price of money and they respond, like any other commodity, to the laws of supply and demand. But they do have a minimum rate below which they cannot in practice fall , and that is the inflation rate. In the economically sophisticated climate in which we now live depositors no longer accept that they should have a negative interest rate. The old idea of people leaving savings with savings banks and getting less than the inflation rate-in other words, losing money-no longer exists. People are looking for reasonable interest rates. What they are looking for are real interest rates. So there is a level below which interest rates will not fall, and that level is the rate of inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point I want to make is that we should be clear that not everyone loses by high interest rates; some people gain. Lenders gain. The beneficiaries of high interest rates are often small people-very much smaller than the people who are borrowing. Small people gain by their insurance, their superannuation and their savings being at higher rates because of high interest rates. I am not using this as an argument for having high interest rates but a fact which we should take into account is that the social effects of high interest rates are not all adverse.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third and most important point is that government can control the money supply or interest rates. It can control one or the other, but not both. If it tries to control both, it introduces the most disastrous distortions into the whole economic system. We believe-I am absolutely sure we are right-that we must control the money supply as it is one of the very few weapons any Federal government has in trying to keep inflation under control. I have no doubt that the Australian Labor Party would let the money supply rip, as it did in the Whitlam years-in one year there was a 27 per cent increase in the money supply- with consequential disastrous effects on inflation. We are not prepared to take such an irresponsible attitude. We believe we must control the money supply as one of the key roles of a government in the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another point on the same matter is that Australia is part of the world economy . We cannot isolate ourselves from the world economy and the effects of interest rates in other countries. Of course sometimes this can help us. In recent months interest rates in Australia have fallen, primarily because of the fall in other countries. For instance, the United States prime lending rate peaked at 16.5 per cent in June. It is now 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent. Our interest rate on Treasury bonds, which peaked at 16.4 per cent in June, is now down to 14 per cent. There have been small falls in private sector interest rates. For instance , interest rates on large trading bank overdrafts have fallen by between 1 per cent and 1 1/2 per cent. But we will not get a sustained fall in interest rates until we can get the inflation rate down, because that is the floor under which interest rates will not fall.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course governments can influence interest rates; it is not as though we can do nothing about them. The prime way we can do that is by keeping the Government out of the money market, keeping it from competing for the available money by keeping domestic deficits low. But what governments cannot usefully do is arbitrarily try to keep interest rates below the market rate. If they do that- this has been tried by a number of countries and these consequences have always followed-the supply of money dries up and the people the government is trying to help by arbitrarily keeping interest rates down actually lose because they cannot borrow as there is no money to borrow. They then have to go elsewhere and probably have to pay exorbitant interest rates for their money. The Government cannot arbitrarily keep interest rates below the market value. As I understand the Labor Party's policy, as explained by Senator Gietzelt and others, in effect the Labor Party would go for high deficits and let the money supply blow out. The consequences would be rapidly rising inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. The Australian Financial Review commented on Mr Hayden's Budget approach and his supplementary anouncements of 26 October. What it stated is, I think, patently true. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        This leaves the Labor Party with a fiscal program which promises nothing but unemployment and inflation on a larger scale than we have now, and the prospect of further involuntary devaluations of the Australian dollar as we are locked into a devaluation/inflation spiral.
       </para>
       <para>
        That will be the consequence of following the line advocated by Labor spokesmen. The Government's policy is to get inflation down as a contribution to lower interest rates and aim for small domestic deficits to keep the pressure of government demand out of the market place for the funds available for investment .
       </para>
       <para>
        The second prong of the matter of public importance is the wisdom or effectiveness of the Government's economic policy. Everyone here, and I think everyone in the country, recognises that we are in the middle of a world recession, by far the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. We are, as a country, peculiarly vulnerable to international conditions because we are one of the great overseas trading nations of the world. We export 15.8 per cent of our gross domestic product. That is about the same level as Japan, which is regarded as a country peculiarly dependent on international trade, and much higher than that of the United States, for instance. The three prongs of our international trading economy are all in trouble at the same time. Primary products are in trouble because of the drought, mineral exports are in trouble because of depressed world commodity prices and demands, and our manufacturers are in trouble because we have priced ourselves out of the competitive markets.

         —I will come to the evidence in a moment. We are running-this is perhaps the key point in the evidence-a trading deficit on our current account of $9,000m a year. Imports are worth $9,000m more than exports. This is a situation that cannot long continue. What is the Government doing about it? Its policies have sheltered Australia and Australians for a long time from much of the effect of the international recession. If the recession had been of a normal length, those policies would have been effective. The trouble is that this recession has gone on for much longer than any recession since the Great Depression and the consequences for us are here now. As a great trading nation we have to face up to the problems and tackle them as a nation. What do we do? I do not think there is anything the Government can do directly about the drought. I suppose the last Prime Minister who thought he could make it rain was Mr Whitlam, but I do not think he would have made a very successful job even of that. We are providing assistance for the people in trouble. We have a generous and effective program of assistance for people in trouble. One of the difficulties-this came out in Question Time today-is that part of the program of assistance has to be administered through State governments and some of the State governments-for example, the Government of my own State of Victoria-are not being as prompt and efficient in distributing these funds as they should be. But I think the program is generous and appropriate. That is what we can do for the primary industry sector. We must all hope that the drought will be relieved as soon as possible because it is having devastating effects on our national economy and, particularly, on our rural economy.

        I turn now to the question of our mineral exports. The demand and commodity prices for our mineral exports are, as I said, both down. It is a crazy time to be pushing up the costs of our minerals by excessive wage demands and by a reduction in working hours, which is just another way of getting a wage rise. Worse still, our export port conditions are dreadful. The industrial turmoil in our ports is difficult to understand. If the situation in Australia were viewed from overseas-from the Philippines or somewhere like that-it would seem that we have it made, that we have everything going for us. The only dangers we have are ourselves and our lack of reliability as suppliers. Supplies may be promised to companies for delivery on a particular date but if those supplies come from Australia the companies cannot be sure there will not be a strike on the waterfront, that Wran's navy will be not be operating off the coast again and that the supplies will be delivered on the due date. We must eliminate that because it is enormously damaging to our reputation and our performance as an international commodity supplier.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to manufactured exports, here, too, we have the same problems of excessive wage increases and the campaign for shorter hours, which again raises the unit costs of labour. In the year ended in June wages rose by 3 per cent to 4 per cent more than the rise in the consumer price index. Average wages rose by 16.4 per cent, as compared with a CPI increase of 12.3 per cent. At a time when our gross domestic product, the product of the whole community, is static or possibly decreasing, it is disastrous for a sector of the economy to demand and achieve more in real terms. With that situation and with a highly competitive international market, employers have no option but either to shed labour- unemployment-or to reduce investment in new plant and equipment, which leads to future inefficiency and future lessening competitiveness. Both of these are very damaging to the interests of all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a time when our trade unions are receiving 3 per cent to 4 per cent more than the current rate of inflation in wages, wage settlements in West Germany, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, to take three examples, are all at or less than the rate of inflation. We cannot afford to go on paying ourselves a great deal more than we are earning. Worse still, because of our high rate of inflation, which is, without doubt, wage-push inflation, we are even less competitive on the international market. Inflationary rates over the last 12 months have been as follows: Australia 12.3 per cent; Britain 8 per cent ; Japan 3.1 per cent; and the United States 5.9 per cent. The average rate for the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the developed free enterprise countries, was 7.9 per cent. We are 4 1/2 per cent above the OECD average. We are pricing ourselves out of our markets. Without doubt, this is wage-push inflation. We must get this rate of wage increase down if we are to remain competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many pressures on inflation. I have mentioned wages, to which I shall return, but there are other pressures, some of which we just have to accept. The first pressure is the effect of devaluation. I think that everyone in this chamber is aware of the extent to which the Australian dollar has been devalued in recent months. This is essential if we are to remain reasonably competitive in international markets, but we must not conceal from ourselves the fact that it has inflationary effects inside Australia. The second pressure on inflation is the shift-it has been modest so far-towards indirect taxes. This also is necessary in the long term. We are unduly reliant on personal income tax. There must be a better balance and some shift towards indirect taxes; but again, we must not conceal from ourselves that this is in the short term, once off, inflationary. A great deal of the very sharp and very unfortunate rise in the last CPI figure was because of the effect of indirect taxes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third pressure on inflation is our oil pricing policy, our world parity pricing policy, coupled with the effects of devaluation. I do not want to enter into that argument again. I think that all in this chamber are aware of and accept the vital necessity of our maintaining world parity for our oil. Without that, oil exploration would die. Nevertheless, at a time when we are devaluing the dollar, it is having an inflationary effect. Those are the pressures which, I think, are unavoidable, or which we have to accept. What then can the Government do? The first thing we can do is to control the money supply and accept that because we are controlling the money supply we cannot also control interest rates. We must control the money supply as the key weapon-vitually the only weapon we have-in the control of inflation. We have maintained out money supply at a rate of about 11.3 per cent to the year ending September this year. That rate has been maintained fairly consistently over recent years. I remind honourable senators again that during the Whitlam years the rate of increase of the money supply reached 27 per cent on one occasion. That is one thing we can do; that is within our power.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point is that we have to press ahead with wage restraints. The Commonwealth Government's powers are very limited in this field but Commonwealth and State governments together have all the powers. What we must do, through a co-operative approach, is to press ahead with wage restraints. We cannot go on pricing ourselves out of our markets. This is the purpose of the Premiers Conference next month. Honourable senators in this chamber have shown an example in accepting restraint on parliamentary salaries. Admittedly it is within the power of the Federal Government to limit the wage increases of its own employees . There are over 400,000 people in the community employed by the Government. However, it is not reasonable to freeze their wages for a prolonged period unless the rest of the economy is following suit. We have both a power over and a duty to our own employees.

         —The market place provides very effective control of prices. I saw a good example of this a little while ago. In Melbourne a garage proprietor was offended at the margin he received for selling his petrol. So, arbitrarily, he said: 'I will put the price of my petrol up to 49c a litre'. He appeared on television with his petrol pump showing 49c a litre. That did not last. He did not sell any petrol at that price. Reasonable competition in the market place forced him and others down to a fair figure. We will get a much fairer figure through proper competition than we will by government regulation. If the Labor Party is sincere in what it has said time after time in this chamber concerning the importance of economic policy to the well being of all Australians it should support us on wage restraint. The Labor Party should use its influence with the trade union movement to see that exports are handled expeditiously and not disrupted by absurd strikes. If members of the Labor Party were sincere they would help us in these two areas of work for the good of all Australians. They would come with us. I do not think they will.

Sir John said: 'This man will be a Minister very soon, so sound is he in his economic theory and so high in his intellectual capacity.' The name of the then new member for Isaacs was David Hamer who was a very distinguished captain in the Royal Australian Navy when I had the honour to be the Minister for the Navy. Captain Hamer's performance since then has done nothing, I am sure , to make Sir John change his mind concerning his high intellectual capacity or my admiration of him. I always admire the speeches and the contributions that he makes, whether it be in this place or anywhere else. Compliments in this place are normally followed by the word 'but' and I am going to add a mild 'but' to my comments. I enjoyed his speech, which in theory I could find little to fault, but the way in which he fitted that theory to the facts I believe left a bit to be desired. He said one thing that disappointed me. He said the only weapon with which to fight inflation is control of the money supply.

         —Yes. I thank Senator Hamer. That is where I vigourously disagree with him. The Government has been using only that weapon for seven years. It has been singularly unsuccessful in fighting inflation. In fact almost every other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country has tackled both inflation and unemployment in the past six or seven years. Most of them have succeeded in beating inflation to some extent, at the expense of unemployment. The level of unemployment in most of the OECD countries has gone up but the inflation rate either has been arrested or has come down.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Here in Australia we have a government that has the unique record of making both the inflation rate and the level of unemployment go up simultaneously. That is not easy to do, but this Government has done it. I should have thought that therefore the proposition before the Senate today-the failure of the Government' s economic policies-to a reasonable mind, and Senator David Hamer certainly has one, would be something worth debating. The monetarist theory that the Department of the Treasury, Mr Fraser, Mr Howard and Mr John Stone obsessively pursue is not new. The one that Senator Hamer advocated today is not new. Control of the money supply is a very valuable weapon with which to control inflation if-but only if-a certain set of economic circumstances apply; that is, when the supply of goods and services is about equal to the demand for goods and services.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we had economic equilibrium and injected money into the economy or, to use Senator Hamer's term, increased the money supply, of course we would then have too much money chasing too few goods. Demand inflation would set in and we would have an increase in prices. But surely Senator Hamer does not suggest for one moment that today, or at any time in the past seven years, the demand for goods is anywhere equal to the supply of goods. Let him show me one shopkeeper in his old electorate of Isaacs, or one factory owner in his new Victorian electorate who says: 'I have too many orders. I cannot fill the orders. I have too many customers in my shop. The demand for my goods is so great I can't meet orders. My order book is full'. With great respect to him, I say to him and to John Stone: 'Your policies have failed. Look for new ones. Look for some other method of getting us out of this economic mess'.

        I was worried, as I think all reasonable people were, about the two demonstrations we had recently, one in Parliament House and one last Friday night in Melbourne. I pay no attention to the breaking of the glass door here, the larrikin behaviour of breaking through the barricades or the disgusting behaviour of disrupting the Melbourne Club. That was done by professional agitators who will cash in on the situation. I am talking about the genuine concern which brings 1,000 people from Wollongong and makes several hundreds or a thousand people march through the streets of Melbourne-50-year-old people who, since they were 14 years of age, have worked an eight hour day, who have a mortgage on their homes and who have time payment responsibilities in relation to their refrigerators, their television sets and whatever. These are real people with real problems. They are not dole bludgers any more-that phrase does not adequately cover the 50-year-old family man who has those responsibilities.

        To rely on the economic theories put out by a Treasury that, with great respect , never gets out of its ivory tower of Canberra, which is still trying to run this country and advise the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Cabinet to run this country according to outdated theories in a situation in which it has never placed itself is just not good enough. I agree with Senator Hamer, again in theory; if the Government wants to reduce interest rates, one way of doing so is to keep out of the money market. One of the tragedies this year is that, through sheer economic mismanagement, the Government will have to borrow something like $3,000m on a deficit it has accidentally incurred. My colleague Senator Siddons three months ago issued what I thought was a most constructive, thoughtful, alternative Budget, which did allow for a deficit of that magnitude. He was condemned and criticised by Government speakers as being irresponsible. At least his deficit would have gone to constructive uses. It would have gone to areas which would have created employment opportunities and finally, within a short space of time, relieved the Government of having to pay a deficit. Unemployment is now at 8.2 per cent-over half a million peope are unemployed-and inflation is up again, to 12.3 per cent. And now there seems to be a knee-jerk reaction on behalf of the Government.

        I want to say something about wage rises. I was a little disappointed that my friend Senator Hamer concentrated only on wage increases. He is a student of economics. He understands economics. I quote something that Senator Sir John Carrick said today. There seemed to be an irony in some of the phrases Senator Sir John Carrick used today. He said that the only true cost of an object is the labour that goes into it. The irony is that that is almost precisely what Karl Marx said.

Why I want to attack that fallacy is this: The Government will not solve anything if it says that the only cause of inflation is the rise in wages. I am not silly enough to say that irresponsible increases in wages do not contribute to inflation. I do say that the kind of wage increase members of the Builders Labourers Federation are now laying on in Sydney and elsewhere is despicable. While their mates are out of work, to lay that increase on a stricken building industry is little short of disgusting. It should be branded as such. Only yesterday, when I was in Sydney, I was told they stopped a concrete pour half way through, costing God knows what to the people who are constructing that building. Jack hammers will now be needed to re-start the building. That is criminal behaviour.

        Let me look at another aspect. About 18 months ago another proposition was put forward, condemned by the Government and condemned by all the so-called economic experts in our economic newspapers. I refer to the metal trades industry award. It was said by people who did not know what they were talking about that it was a sweetheart deal, irresponsible and over-generous. Anybody who had talked with the responsible trade unionists and the responsible employers representatives in the metal trades industry would have said this: 'Yes, we have given what appears on the surface to be a generous settlement of this dispute. But we have undertakings from the main trade union and the group of trade unions not to strike for a period of years. We believe that given good will on both sides this will be a beneficial agreement, both to industry, to the trade union and to the community'. That agreement has turned out to be almost a model of how agreements should be formulated. We even have extreme left wing trade union leaders in the metal trades industry now calling off wildcat strikes called on by shop stewards on jobs and saying: 'Look, we made a deal'. This is exactly Australian Democrats policy. The only way to good industrial relations is through good will, through trust, through a consensus being made at the beginning. We believe this is the only way in which we can reach some sort of consensus on industrial relations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me go back to Senator Hamer's point about the explosion in wages being the cause of inflation. Let us take a furniture manufacturer and let us try to envisage a kitchen table. The cost of that table, when the housewife buys it, is represented by the cost of the material, namely, the wood. But to that must be added the cost of the transport to get that wood from the mill to the furniture manufacturer, the cost of the labour, the wages involved in moulding that wood into the shape of a table and then the cost of the transport to the retail store , profits and whatever. Let us assume-this is a fair assessment-that labour represents 30 per cent of those costs. Let us assume also that wages increased by 25 per cent. Therefore, the unit cost of that table would be increased by 25 per cent of 30 per cent because wages represent only 30 per cent of the total cost of the table. What about the price of money? This is where I am critical of my friend Senator Hamer. The price of money is reflected in 100 per cent of the cost of that table. The manufacturer needs money to pay wages, to pay for the wood and to pay for the cartage contractor. He is working on an overdraft. According to calculations I have seen, a one per cent increase in the price of money or working capital for any manufacturer is equal to a 25 per cent increase in the cost of wages across the board. If the conservatives in this Senate wish to criticise undue and unreasonable increases in wages they can do so by all means. But I plead with them to be fair and say that increases in the price of money have as much effect, if not a greater effect, on inflation than wage increases.

        Let us look at what has happened to the lenders of money-those dreadful people who are profiteering at an obscene rate while businesses are going broke and people are being thrown out of work. What happened in 1980-81? The record profits of the Bank of New South Wales rose by 33.3 per cent to $165m. The profits of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd rose by 29 per cent to $175m. Similar increases were recorded by the National Bank of Australasia Ltd, the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Ltd and the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd. If the conservatives in this country are concerned about inflation, why are they not concerned about the excessive profits made by banks and the finance institutions that are the progenies of the banks?

        The Australian Democrats believe that drastic action needs to be taken. We support the wage pause but we say to the Government that a wage pause by itself cannot work. There needs to be a gesture of good will by governments not to increase charges, to consult employers and to establish that employers will play the game with regard to prices. The Government should at least go to the lenders of money-the usurers, the banks and the investment companies-and ask them to join in the spirit of national detente and control interest rates to some extent . Without those sorts of agreements from other sections of the community, how can the Government expect one sector-the working man-to bear the whole brunt of the sacrifice?

        The speech read as follows-

       <para>
        A succession of reports from royal commissions and other inquiries on criminal activities in Australia convinced the Government that a fresh look must be had at existing arrangements and institutions for the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences of a serious kind, particularly offences in the nature of organized crime.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the course of this fresh look, a close examination was made of existing arrangements, consultations were entered into with the States and discussions had by the Attorney-General, Senator Durack in the United States and the United Kingdom in July of this year with law enforcement authorities in those countries . As a result, the Government has concluded that existing Australian law enforcement efforts need to be supplemented by the establishment of a new standing body with the necessary expertise and powers to make an effective attack on organized crime. The purpose of this Bill is therefore to establish such a body to be called the National Crimes Commission which will be given the functions and powers necessary to deal with forms of crime with which existing law enforcement bodies now have difficulty in coping. However, it must be emphasized that the Commission is intended to supplement the efforts of regular law enforcement bodies, not supplant them. It will be directed indeed by the Bill to work in co-operation with these bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several recent royal commissions have demonstrated that they are unable to uncover and bring to public notice instances of wrong-doing not detected by ordinary law enforcement agencies. These include the Costigan Royal Commission which attributes its success in this regard to
       </para>
       <para>
        its power as a royal commission to require by subpoena the production of documents and the attendance of persons for examination; this power is not of course possessed by the police;
       </para>
       <para>
        access to equipment and expertise to enable sophisticated intelligence gathering and analysis;
       </para>
       <para>
        use of personnel with high intellectual capacity and special training.
       </para>
       <para>
        From the Government's general experience and the information obtained by Senator Durack, during his overseas consultations, the Government came to the view that the solution to the need to improve law enforcement does not lie merely in the use of royal commissions in their traditional form. The function of a royal commission is essentially to inquire into and report on the matter referred to it. It may recommend the institution of prosecutions; however, most Australian governments, Commonwealth and State, have had the experience of a royal commission recommending the prosecution of named persons but it being subsequently found that it is not possible to bring the prosecutions because of lack of evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further consideration in relation to royal commissions is that it usually takes a royal commission quite some time to establish itself and develop expertise in its particular task. That expertise and its trained staff are dispersed when the Commission's task is finished.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having regard to these considerations, the Government concluded that, while the new form of Commission should have certain points of similarity with a royal commission, for example, the subpoena powers of such a body and the power to examine witnesses, it should differ from that body in several significant respects.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the most important difference will be that the primary function of the Commission will not be to make reports to government but rather to inquire into areas of criminal activity with a view to prosecution action, if appropriate. It will be enabled to pass information, as obtained, to the regular police forces but, in serious or more complex cases, it is intended that it will seek the appointment of a special counsel who, if prosecutions eventuate, would be the ultimate prosecutor. This is seen by the Government as the means by which the Commission will be enabled to make the most effective input into the prosecution process. A special prosecutor appointed under the recently enacted Special Prosecutors Act could, in appropriate cases, handle prosecutions resulting from the Commission's operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other important differences between the Crimes Commission and the traditional form of royal commissions are-
       </para>
       <para>
        it will be a standing body able to accumulate experience and expertise; within its wide statutory area of inquiry it will not require a reference from government but it can be given a particular reference by government;
       </para>
       <para>
        the Crimes Commission will be given a discretion to conduct its hearings in private; this will be appropriate if there is possibility of prejudice to the ultimate fair trial of a person;
       </para>
       <para>
        self-incrimination will be expressly made a lawful excuse for failure to answer questions put by the Commission; the Commission can seek immunity for a witness in an appropriate case as to use of his evidence against him in subsequent proceedings; but, except where such immunity was granted, the answers given by a witness would not be made by the statute inadmissible in other proceedings; this is contrary to the rule applying in relation to royal commissions;
       </para>
       <para>
        the Commission will not be permitted to name persons in public reports as suspected of committing criminal offences;
       </para>
       <para>
        the Commission will not be expected to examine under subpoena the principal target of the investigation unless this person wished to give evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission will be empowered in its annual reports to draw attention to patterns or trends and the nature and scope of any criminal activity coming to its attention. It will also be empowered to recommend, on the basis of its investigatory experience, changes in the law or administrative action, for example, that the attention of the police should be directed to particular areas . In addition, the Commission can be empowered by a reference from the Government to conduct a general inquiry, which could include public hearings, into a particular area of concern with a view to making recommendations to government. In exercising this function, the Commission would be prohibited from naming individuals as suspected of committing criminal offences.

       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government recognizes the need to ensure that proposed changes in law enforcement procedures and institutions do not prejudice individual rights. Therefore:
       </para>
       <para>
        self-incrimination will be provided as a lawful excuse to answering questions by the Commission and by an amendment accepted by the Government in the other chamber, this is extended to production of documents;
       </para>
       <para>
        when the Commission is investigating suspected criminal activities, it will be given appropriate discretion to ensure that a hearing will not be in public if the ultimate trial of a person would thereby be prejudiced;
       </para>
       <para>
        a witness will be entitled to attendance expenses and to be represented by counsel if he so wishes;
       </para>
       <para>
        the Commission will not be empowered to name persons in a report as suspected of committing criminal offences or as recommended for prosecution; by an amendment accepted by the Government in the other chamber the Commission is required to ensure that its reports do not, by identifying persons, prejudice their safety, reputation or fair trial;
       </para>
       <para>
        the Commission will not be expected in ordinary circumstances to examine under subpoena the principal target of an investigation;
       </para>
       <para>
        the legislation will expire after 5 years unless extended by Parliament after review of the Commission's activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        By clause 7 the Commission will be given an authority to investigate on its own initiative or at the request of the Attorney-General a wide range of matters within the Commonwealth's constitutional jurisdiction. While the Attorney- General will be able to issue directions or guidelines of a general nature, he will not be able to issue a direction or guideline as to the conduct of a particular investigation. The community thus has the assurance that the Commission will be able to discharge the functions entrusted to it by Parliament , free from any extraneous direction as to particular matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now deal with the very important question of participation in this national effort by the States and the Northern Territory. From the outset the Commonwealth Government has emphasized the great desirability of the States and the Northern Territory participating in this matter. A series of meetings have been had with State Ministers and the Government is hopeful that the States will recognize the desirability, and indeed the essentiality, of involvement in this national effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        To allow for State participation, the Bill as introduced provides for involvement of the States and the Northern Territory in either of 2 ways. Firstly, provision is made in the Bill to permit a State or the Northern Territory to vest functions in the Commission by, or under, a State or Territory law. Secondly, the legislation will permit members of the Commission, with the consent of the Attorney-General, to accept functions or powers from a State or the Northern Territory, for example a commission under State legislation providing for establishment of Royal Commissions, and to perform those functions and exercise those powers in conjunction with the performance or exercise by the Commission of its functions or powers under the Bill. In this connection, the Commission members would be able to use the resources and facilities of the Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thus, under these provisions, it will be open to a State or the Territory to authorize the Commission either on a standing basis in relation to a general area or on an ad hoc basis in relation to a specific matter to carry out investigations drawing on State or Territory powers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government sees the first alternative as the preferable and more effective one but the second course, if preferred by a particular State, is workable provided the relevant State legislation is in a form compatible with the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence is seen by the Government as an important adjunct to the Crimes Commission and the Government is prepared to support a review of the resources available to the Bureau with a view to upgrading of its performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another important feature of the Government's legislative plan of action in relation to the criminal law is the Criminal Investigation Bill. This Bill, which was introduced in this chamber in November last year, has attracted considerable comment including comments from police forces and Senator Durack, shortly before his illness, considered these comments in detail and approved a number of proposed amendments to the Bill to take into account the public response. Unfortunately, before it was possible for the Bill to be brought on for debate, Senator Durack's illness intervened preventing the matter from being brought to finality.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, all too clearly in recent months we have seen evidence of the dangers presented to the Australian community by organized crime and crimes involving sophisticated techniques and methods. While in no way belittling the efforts of the ordinary law enforcement agencies of Australia, it is clear that the problems presented by these new developments require new solutions. The Government is confident that the Crimes Commission to be established by this Bill with the new functions and powers given by the legislation and the expertise that it can be expected to develop will be a very significant supplement to the efforts of law enforcement agencies; together with those agencies it will provide an effective answer to the problems presented by these new developments in the field of crime.

       <para>
        This Bill is a complementary measure to the National Crimes Commission Bill. It is directed to ensuring that royal commissions have effective powers and procedures so that they may carry out their important functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making its proposal for establishment of a National Crimes Commission, the Government of course did not have in mind doing away with royal commissions. Each type of body will have its special function and use. The primary purpose of the Crimes Commission will be to assemble the evidence for prosecutions in difficult cases of organized crimes and the like. By contrast, the basic purpose of a royal commission is to ascertain the facts as to a particular matter or matters and, where appropriate, make recommendations to government for future action. However, as the Bill now before the House recognizes, royal commissions can vary somewhat in objectives, and powers that may be appropriate for one royal commission may not be appropriate for another.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-the Costigan Commission-in its Interim Report No. 4 made recommendations for certain amendments to the Royal Commissions Act. The first was that a royal commissioner should be empowered to issue a search warrant where he believes on reasonable grounds that a person has documents relevant to the terms of reference of the Commission and there is a reasonable likelihood of the destruction of the documents. The Commission pointed out that mere service of a subpoena to produce documents will, if the person has something to conceal, result in the destruction and non-production of documents. The subpoena, the Commission said, acts as a warning to such a person of the Commission's interest . The Government broadly accepts this recommendation subject to the qualification that the warrant should be granted by an independent judicial officer. It has also concluded that the application of the provision should be limited to royal commissions whose Letters Patent indicate an intention that the provision should apply. Proposed new section 4 so provides.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next recommendation of Mr Costigan was that the procedures and remedies available to a royal commission to deal with witnesses who failed to attend or answer questions should be strengthened. Existing powers and penalties were, it was said, inadequate. Reference was made to the equivalent provisions of the Victorian Evidence Act. The Government again broadly accepts this recommendation . The procedures provided under proposed new section 6C for dealing with such witnesses are broadly based on this recommendation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under this provision a witness who fails to take an oath or answer questions may be referred to the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory. That court may order the person to comply with the relevant requirement. Failure to comply would be punishable as contempt of court. However , these provisions will be limited to royal commissions with Letters Patent indicating that intention. In further consultations with Mr Costigan the need emerged to put beyond doubt the power of the Commission to communicate information and documents to a Special Prosecutor, the National Crimes Commission or Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, State or Northern Territory and law enforcement bodies generally. This doubt is removed by proposed new section 6P.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 1912, section 6DD of the Act has rendered statements or disclosures by a witness before a royal commission inadmissible in evidence against him except in any criminal proceedings for an offence against the Act. Because of the existence of this section, it was the view for many years that, on the proper construction of the Act, self-incrimination was not a lawful excuse for the failure of a witness to answer questions or produce documents. However, the decision of the High Court in Hammond v. The Commonwealth (1982) 56 ALJR 767 cast doubt on this construction although the majority formally reserved judgment on this point. The actual ground on which the majority of the Court granted an injunction restraining the royal commission in question from continuing its examination of Mr Hammond was that questions were being put to him by the Commission as to facts directly relevant to issues in criminal proceedings already commenced against him.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must emphasise that the present Bill would not affect that ground nor the result of any future similar proceedings but, given the fact that section 6DD protects a witness against use of evidence given by him to a commission in other proceedings and the need for a royal commission to establish the facts of a particular matter, the Government has concluded that the doubt as to the construction of the Act arising from the High Court decision should be removed and that it be made clear that, in the special circumstances of a royal commission hearing, self-incrimination is not an excuse for failure to answer questions or produce documents. However, to make clear that the amendment will not affect the actual ground of the High Court's decision in the Hammond case, the Government, in the other chamber, moved an amendment, the affect of which is that self-incrimination is a valid excuse for failing to answer questions or produce documents in relation to an offence with which the witness has been charged.
       </para>
       <para>
        I explain that different considerations apply under this Bill than apply in relation to the National Crimes Commission Bill for the reason that the primary purpose of that Commission is to obtain evidence admissible in a court for a prosecution where appropriate. Thus, under that Bill self-incrimination is an available excuse, subject however to an indemnity having been given by the Attorney-General and there is no prohibition on use in a court of the evidence obtained by the Crimes Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        A final feature of the present Bill is the provision made in proposed new section 7AA which is intended to remove doubt as to the capacity of a Commonwealth royal commission to accept powers and functions given to it by a State government in the form of a parallel commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        When special circumstances arise calling for the establishment of a royal commission to inquire into a particular matter, it is in the interests of the nation that the body should be clothed with all necessary powers and given effective procedures so that it can fulfill its important task expeditiously and effectively. The present Bill is directed to this end and the new powers and procedures provided under the Bill will greatly enhance the ability of royal commissions to discharge the many and varied functions for which they are established. I commend it to the Senate.

        The Senate referred certain aspects of the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982 to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts just under five weeks ago. Despite the tight deadlines involved we have addressed, very directly, each of the terms of reference and are unanimous in our conclusions and recommendations. We received 35 submissions and other evidence including clear and for the most part comprehensive material from all the major interested groups. The Committee tested the submissions in a full range of public hearings. Details of the submissions and hearings are set out in the report.

This was a consequence firstly of the quite specific special terms of reference given to us by the Senate and secondly of the inevitable limitation following the fact that only a few weeks were available for this inquiry. The Committee's terms of reference required us to consider the likely effect of the proposed loan scheme on existing student assistance, the proposed agreement between the Government and certain banks, suggestions that the maximum loan be increased above $1,000 and eligibility for student loan assistance. In general, the Committee found that the proposed scheme should be effective and fair and that it amounts to a supplementary financial resource available to students. However, as noted in the report, the Committee was concerned that some areas of uncertainty had not been publicly clarified at the time the Bill was introduced in the Parliament and that this had led to some public confusion. The evidence taken by the Committee has shown that these matters are already, for the most part, resolved and will be finalised in time for the loans to be made available early in 1983.

        This inquiry, I believe, has been a good use of the Senate committee system for reviewing proposed legislation. No proposals to amend the Bill have emerged from the inquiry but for all concerned this review has clarified the operation of the legislation and the loan scheme itself. For example, witnesses representing tertiary education students at the Committee's public hearings expressed fears about the criteria which will be applied by the banks when assessing students' applications for loans. Evidence given at the Committee's public hearings by the Australian Bankers Association and the administering departments was able to allay these fears. The Committee, and through it the Senate and the public, are now much better informed about the intent of the Bill and its proposed administrative arrangements. I will now summarise quite briefly the specific conclusions and recommendations reached by the committee.

         —The Committee was unanimous. Term of reference (a) required us to report to the Senate by today and it is good to note that we have been able to do so. Term of reference (b) required the Committee to investigate the likely effect, if any, of the proposed loan scheme on post-graduate awards, the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, adult secondary education assistance and the Aboriginal study grant schemes. The Committee concluded that the loan scheme will neither replace nor diminish them. Its only significant effect will be to supplement the benefits that they currently make avaliable. Term of reference (c ) required the Committee to investigate the proposed agreement between the Government and certain banks. A detailed examination of the agreement that is to be concluded is outlined in chapter 4 of the report. One matter that is still being negotiated is the level of service charges to be levied by the banks on student loan applicants, but at the worst these will be at the same level as normal loan accounts.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Importantly, the Committee was assured by bank and Commonwealth Government representatives that banks will be approving all eligible student applicants for loans except on only one ground; that is a prior unsatisfactory repayment record already established by the applicant. Other factors, such as future earning capacity, course of study, age, sex, academic record or socio-economic background, will not be taken into account. The initial fund of $50m for the 1983 year is fixed, but the Committee has been assured that loans will be allocated by an even distribution and in a fair manner to students in all parts of Australia. The Committee recommends that for the second and subsequent years of operation the total amount available to the scheme be renegotiated and, if required, adjusted to match the best informed assessment of the needs of students.
       </para>
       <para>
        Term of reference (d) required the Committee to consider suggestions from secretarial, commercial and other colleges that the maximum loan be increased to $2,500. The Committee has concluded that the maximum loan should not at this time be increased above the proposed limit of $1,000 for any group of students mainly because, with the fixed $50m available next year to the scheme, the number of potential beneficiaries would be substantially reduced, and we think unfairly reduced. However, this matter should be given serious consideration during the review of the scheme before the second year of the scheme's operation .
       </para>
       <para>
        Term of reference (e) required the Committee to look at the limitation of the scheme to grantees specified in sub-clause 3 (2) of the Student Assistance ( Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill. The Committee concluded that, for the most part, the eligibility criteria set out in the Bill are fair. Again, certain aspects should be reviewed after the scheme's first year of operation, including consideration of allowing single post-graduate students to have comparable eligibility with single Commonwealth post-graduate award holders, and consideration should be given to the case for some part time students being eligible under the scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other matters to come out of the inquiry that I should highlight concern counselling, appeal procedures and the existing campus-based loan funds. We believe prospective student loan applicants should be encouraged to seek financial counselling from campus-based or community counsellors. We also believe appeal procedures should be defined and publicised in the event of an applicant being rejected by banks or by an officer of the Department of Education. We also believe that the existing campus-based emergency loan funds should, as necessary, be supplemented or in the cases where they do not now exist, introduced in all higher education institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I would like to reassure the Senate, just as the Committee has been reassured by the evidence presented to it, that this proposed loans scheme in its current form does have the prospect of achieving its stated objective of being an effective and equitable supplement to existing student assistance. Regular monitoring and review will be important to ensure the longer term success of the scheme and its possible further liberalisation. We recommend that all interested parties-government, banks and student representatives-be involved in this process of review. The seventeenth century English proverb that ' creditors have better memories than debtors' may still hold true, but student borrowers here need not fear; their mental processes and their study, even if not their memories, should be enhanced by the easing of immediate financial pressures on them. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.

I want to place on record the gratitude I have for the way in which the Committee attended to its duties so rapidly. I do not want to respond to the substance; that is an appropriate matter to be raised when the debate on the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill, to which the report refers, comes up. I will not come back to that matter, but I make it clear that the Committee has, within the space of about a month, been able to accept the reference from the Senate, to seek submissions, to consider the submissions, to hold public hearings, to consider the findings, to write up the report and to present it today. I believe it reflects credit upon the Committee.

       That, unless otherwise ordered, the Senate meet on Friday, 19 November 1982 at 9.00 a.m., and that the sessional order relating to the adjournment of the Senate have effect at 4.30 p.m. on that day.

      <para>
       In light of the fact that I am moving a motion which seeks to extend the sitting of the Senate to Friday in order to pick up the substantial amount of business which remains to be done by the Senate I do not think that I should take a great deal of the Senate's precious time in extolling the virtues of the motion. The general shape of the program is well known and understood, I think, by honourable senators. At the beginning of the current three-week period of sitting the Leader of the Government in the Senate put down an indicative program for the three-week period in the hope that we would be able to deal with the remaining business within that period. Further prolonging of the sittings did not appear necessary at that time and we have been seeking to pursue that program. We have, of course, fallen behind already. The Senate is still considering Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83 in the Committee stage, a matter which we had hoped to have concluded last week along with Appropriation Bill (No . 2) 1982-83.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is seeking to extend the sittings in this way to maintain the real prospect of completing the business of the Senate within the originally indicated period. It is appreciated that that is a matter which gives rise to some inconvenience to honourable senators. It of course gives rise to some inconvenience to Government senators but it is inevitable that whatever the extension of the sittings, whether it is at the end of a week or by prolongation of the sittings proper, it gives rise to some rearrangement of programs. In any event the Government believes that at this late stage of the sittings it is reasonable, as we have done so often in the past, to sit on one additional day. I commend this motion to the Senate.

We have consistently said, since the Senate's sitting hours were fixed by agreement of the Senate, that we would assist the Government in obtaining its legislative program within those hours. We do not agree to sitting additional hours or odd days in order to expedite the Government's program. On the other hand, we are quite happy to sit an additional week within the normal hours, if that becomes necessary, in order to complete the Government 's program. Of course, that may well become necessary. In past weeks a number of comments have been made from the Government side that it was the intention of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to have an election this year on the basis of delays in the Senate. That has now disappeared as a possibility.

It is probably clear to anybody who is listening that I am a pretty incoherent fellow but I would like it to be understood that my apparent incoherence relates to persistent interjections which are being made while I am trying to say something of profound importance to the people of this country. Senator Chaney well knows that. We have consistently maintained that the Senate should sit the hours which the Senate agreed it should sit and that, if necessary, we would sit an extra week to complete the Government's program. There has been a lot of discussion about delays engendered, first of all, by the Prime Minister in the hope of finding an excuse for an early election for reasons which could happen only in Australia. The Prime Minister, unfortunately, was afflicted with a bad back and the possibility of an early election receded. There has been a degree of honesty in the discussion. It is now agreed that most of the delays have occurred in the House of Representatives and in the Government getting its program into the Senate.

       There does not seem to be any great point in pursuing at great length this argument about the Opposition's position because it is clear that the Australian Democrats, our Senate colleagues, have agreed to sit next Friday. In that circumstance there are not the numbers in the Senate to oppose the motion which has been moved by Senator Chaney. My understanding is that the Democrats have agreed to sit next Friday on the basis that two-fifths of them do not have to be here as a result of a pairing arrangement with the Government.

         —Last Thursday, during consideration of the estimates for the Department of Defence, I made some comments about the cost of the VIP aircraft. Upon the conclusion of my remarks Senator MacGibbon said that he had just heard a load of nonsense in relation to the Boeing 707 aircraft . He went on to make some remarks about the use of those aircraft. However, he omitted to mention their VIP role. I wish briefly to give some costs associated with these aircraft in their VIP role to support my case, as I said last Thursday that I would do. In 1981 the cost of operating the Boeing 707 aircraft was $9.408m. This year it is $10.279m. On 18 August my colleague Senator Button asked the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) the following question:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        (1) What hourly cost is attributed in Government accounts to the operation of the Boeing 707's of the VIP Fleet.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) What is the current cost of chartering a Boeing 707 aircraft from commercial operators.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Defence supplied the following answer:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) The current hourly operating cost used in Government accounts for the costing of special purpose flights by the RAAF B707 aircraft is $4215. This rate does not provide for amortization of capital costs, aircrew or other 'overhead' charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) Commercial airlines do not provide hourly rates for the charter of aircraft and will normally only provide cost estimates against actual flights specified. In any event, as there are no Boeing 707 aircraft commercially available within Australia, any quotes would need to include the return costs of a positioning leg.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1980 the hourly operating cost used by the Government was $2,757. In 1981 it had risen to $3,633 and now, in 1982, it is $4,215. The operating cost has gone up $1,458 an hour in two years. In 1980, after examining the estimates, I detailed what I considered to be the current hourly operating cost. The figure was $4,189 an hour. That figure was not worked out only by me. A former Minister for Defence in the Labor Government, the honourable member for St George, Mr Morrison, also worked on these figures. We arrived at that cost of $4,189 an hour. I point out to the Senate that at that time a newspaper article stated that the then President of the United States of America, President Carter, had cancelled the use of the 707s in a VIP role because they were costing approximately $4,600 an hour to operate. If these figures or my estimates are correct the current hourly cost should be approximately $5,700 to $6,000. Although the Minister replied to Senator Button that it was not possible to hire a 707 aircraft in Australia, in 1980 an American firm quoted hire at approximately $6,000 an hour. So one would assume that two years later, if our operating costs have gone up here by $1,458, that $6,000 an hour would now be much higher. I think these figures I have used this afternoon would endorse the Australian editorial which referred to the VIP fleet as ludicrously expensive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now wish to move to an item that relates more directly to the estimates for the Department of Defence Support, and that is HMAS Cook. During the Estimates Committee meetings I took the opportunity to inquire after the progress of HMAS Cook. I had been disturbed to read a long and presumably correct article in the Sun-Herald of 29 August this year claiming that HMAS Cook is a $30m disaster. The article, which was headed 'HMAS Lemon!', stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        It wasn't a happy fifth birthday on Friday for HMAS Cook. She spent it in dry dock, appropriately for the fifth time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Cook, launched five years ago, commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy two years and now estimated to cost more than $30 million, has still not been formally accepted by the Navy from its builders-Williamstown Naval dockyard.
       </para>
       <para>
        She just keeps sailing into trouble.
       </para>
       <para>
        And the captain is not pleased. 'I'd like to get hold of the bloke who designed the ship and try to find out what he was thinking about,' said Commander P. J. Cooke-Russell.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article goes on at some length to talk about the difficulties the ship has suffered in those five years. HMAS Cook was commissioned in October 1980, and although launched five years ago does not expect to be in operation until May 1983 when it will, I hope, finally be accepted into service. As our Estimates Committee said, HMAS Cook is the Royal Australian Navy's only oceanographic ship . The Committee members believe that it is very important, in view of the research requirements of the newly claimed 200 nautical mile zone and the need to capitalise on that, to make available all possible facilities to those able to use them. Unfortunately, as the newspaper article states, the succession of problems which have beset the ship have forced the cancellation of two major oceanographic research programs which involved work around the Australian coast and also an expedition to the South Pacific. The Committee was also concerned that the problems revealed about HMAS Cook in response to questions I asked may be seriously reducing the RAN's ability to carry out hydrographic work.

         —I was interested in Senator Sibraa's comments. What Senator Sibraa thinks and what he says are apparently two different things. If he intended to say that last week, I regret that that is not what he said because I not only have a clear recollection of what he said but also I did with care read the Hansard the day after. I think it is a grave disservice to Australia's defence that the position is maintained by the Australian Labor Party that the Royal Australian Air Force 707s are operating as VIP transports. That is the point I made last week. It is not true. They have a function as transport aircraft for the Service. They provide a heavy lift, long- range, intercontinental capability. No other aircraft in the RAAF inventory fulfils that role. We do not have enough of them to provide us with the lifting capability and the transport capability that they provide.

         —Not with the frequency with which we need them for the courier services to Butterworth and things like that. Furthermore, in an emergency one could imagine that those aircraft would be tied up. But the attribution of costs to the 707s is entirely erroneous. They are a defence asset . They are principally used in the transport role. The cost of training and paying the air crews is a fixed overhead. The amortisation on the asset itself, on the air frame, is something that is laid off against the defence vote. It is the height of financial irresponsibility to talk about it in terms of a commercial hire figure, to say that the true cost would be $6,000 an hour or $4, 000 an hour, whatever an American carrier assigns to it, because there are the direct operating costs of that aircraft, the superannuation and salaries of the pilots and air crew, and the amortisation of the asset and its replacement in due course. None of those costs has relevance when for a minor part of the time aircraft are assigned to a VIP function by the RAAF. I do not know what the figure would be, but it is probably a quarter of the figure put forward by Senator Sibraa. It is an act of gross disservice to the Australian defence forces to put forward that sort of argument in public. It is just an act of cheap political publicity.

        The Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Peter Henderson, had embarked on a 'bold and shameless cover-up plan' over an alleged embezzlement from the Australian Embassy in Teheran and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, had been caught 'purveying lies to the Parliament' . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In a statement as serious as that, I think it would be appropriate for me to ask Mr Henderson whether he would care to comment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Henderson immediately replied, as one would expect:
       </para>
       <para>
        Yes, I would like to respond to that invitation to comment.
       </para>

        He then went on to give his version of the events that had been raised by Senator Primmer in the Senate and supported the actions of Mr Bowden, who just happened to be present also with the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs. I did not ask any questions on the matter at the time. I was concerned as to whether the comments that were being made were under privilege. I did not know all of the details concerned, and I certainly did not know all of the details that had been raised by Senator Primmer. By the time I had checked with the Clerks on whether the comments being made were under privilege, the matter had been dealt with.
       </para>
       <para>
        What concerns me is that the Estimates Committee was supposed to be reviewing the estimates of the Department. Whilst it has been the custom to ask some general questions before detailed questions are asked, I think that we must be very careful that these Estimates committees are not used by public servants to answer questions that have been raised in the Senate on another occasion. Some Government senators may think that in this case the people accused should be given the opportunity to answer. However, what I can see occurring in the future is that the Estimates committee hearings will be taken up by disputes of this kind.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not doubt the sincerity of Senator Jessop in raising the issue, but I think that Senator Jessop would have been able to give the point of view that perhaps Mr Henderson and some of the officers were able to give during this Estimates Committee hearing. In the circumstances that arose at this Estimates Committee hearing, it would have been quite proper for Senator Primmer, if he had been aware of what was happening, to attend the Estimates Committee hearing and to direct questions not only to Mr Henderson, in my opinion, but also to Mr Bowden, who was, as I mentioned, present. If this is the way in which Estimates committees hearings are going to be run in the future, then I assure the Government that this is exactly what is going to happen and that perhaps the next time we have the Department of Foreign Affairs before us Senator Primmer will be able to ask questions of Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden directly on the matter he raised in the Senate.

         —I raise the same matter as Senator Sibraa. As explained by Senator Sibraa, Senator Jessop at that meeting gave Mr Henderson an opportunity to make a comment on something that was said in the Senate by Senator Primmer. When a member of parliament makes statements under privilege he usually has fairly good reasons for this and very rarely has this practice been abused. I do not believe the privilege should be extended beyond members of parliament-although Mr Henderson was under privilege. He did complain -I daresay he had a right to make the remarks-when he said:

       <para>
        Yes, I would like to respond to that invitation to comment. I should like to make first a general point that when members of the Public Service are attacked in that way in Parliament, it is very difficult for them to have any recourse-
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, having felt affront that he had no way of talking under privilege, the first thing he did was to attack another colleague. He immediately took advantage of the situation to say something under privilege about this other colleague. That did perturb me at the time. I was not sure what to do about it. I daresay I was remiss and should have said something. Later on when I started to ask a question I was caught in flight by Mr Henderson. I said:
       </para>
       <para>
        While we are on that matter, I understand that Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden have a writ out against Senator Primmer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I had finished the question Mr Henderson said:
       </para>
       <para>
        May I explain that?
       </para>
       <para>
        I had to interrupt him and ask him to let me put my question first. The question I was asking related to whether the Department had to pick up the tab in the case of a writ in the Department, if a case exists. As it turns out there are cases where the Department takes writs out. The Chairman rightly tried to call a halt to this. I said to the Chairman:

        In relation to your remarks, Mr Chairman, my questions were pertinent to the Department and expenses of the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        That has worried me since because I do not think it behoves the Committee to behave in such a manner. Since then I have received a letter from a Mr Witheford and a Mr Henne. The letter states:

        To deal briefly with each of the allegations Mr Henderson has made:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. Many serving and retired officers contributed to the evidence Mr Witheford passed to Mr Street on 8 April 1982, at his request. Messrs Witheford, Henne, F. Sergi and Johns were numbered amongst them. Extreme care was taken to check with informants in detail as the evidence was being prepared for submission to Mr Street. In consultation with Mr Street's staff, detailed independent professional legal consideration was given to the allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Two of the abovementioned persons have strenuously denied any suggestion such as Mr Henderson's that they changed their evidence under police questioning and one of them has advised that he has taken up this and related matters of concern with Senator Cyril Primmer direct. Mr Witheford has been unable to contact a third man but the former's letter of 16 August 1982 to the Australian Federal Police (Senate Hansard, page 840) effectively disposes of any doubts about Mr Sergi's evidence re the snowclearing payments to Mr Bowden's sons. It is patently false to say that any of our informants does not support the allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. The Senate has already been informed why the Department of Finance's report on these irregularities is 'hopelessly dishonest'. It is aware that the Ombudsman is involved in an investigation of serious misconduct by the police officers dealing with the matter. We have evidence that action has been taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs to nobble the internal police investigation initiated by the Ombudsman.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Important files and other documents are admitted by the Department of Foreign Affairs to be missing. Additional important documents about Tehran have been withheld from us without good reason. We have further evidence both financial and relating to the cover-up. We are not disposed to provide this to any authority that is already besmirched by the improper handling of this matter .
       </para>
       <para>
        5. There have indeed been strenuous attempts to influence matters and to intimidate us and other ex-Tehran staff, including attempts by Mr Henderson, himself, and by Mr R. J. Smith. These include improper threats of legal action, refusal to grant us normal overseas posting and higher duties privileges and the malicious propagation of false rumours about several of us, as a means of undermining the overwhelming evidence of Mr Bowden's misconduct.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. We believe that the evidence leads inexorably to the conclusion that there has been, and is continuing to be a long running cover-up operation which cries out for investigation. A senior management which behaves in this way inevitably forfeits the respect of the honest majority of its staff. We attach an analysis listing the various sections of the Commonwealth Crimes Act which to our knowledge have been breached in this affair.
       </para>
       <para>
        7. We are hopeful that the work of the Ombudsman and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts will succeed in setting the record straight. We have in mind seeking a broader inquiry into the whole matter, perhaps by the Ombudsman.

         —I am drawn into this debate because my name was mentioned with regard to the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee D. I think it is appropriate that we should talk about the question of privilege because it is something that has worried me for a long time. People are quite often mentioned under privilege in this Parliament and perhaps in the committee fora. They may be unfairly criticised or named or inaccurate statements may be made without their having an opportunity to reply. I have suggested, as chairman of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, that the role of parliamentary privilege committees should be extended to include the role of an ethics committee, so that if people feel they are misrepresented under privilege in this Parliament or during a committee hearing, they would have recourse to reply .

        We should look at this very carefully and consider it as responsible senators and members of parliament. I put that view on the record. I merely asked a question of Mr Henderson following fairly flamboyant statements that were made in the Press. I thought it was appropriate to give Mr Henderson an opportunity to reply in a similar way to those charges that were made and, as a result, he received some publicity. I do not wish to denigrate my Opposition colleagues in any way. But I think it is time that we examined the question of what is said in this place to make sure that, before we make any statements concerning members of the public or, indeed, public servants, they are quite accurate.

         —I enter this debate because mention needs to be made to a reference before the Joint Select Committee on Privileges. A public sevant believes that certain statements were made. The Public Service in general believes that when such statements are made public servants have no redress and no forum to which they can go to rebut those statements. That is not quite the case. A public servant has access to the Parliament when his reputation is in question. For example, a former Deputy Director-General of the Department of Health, Mr Nettle, and his family were aggrieved because of evidence which was given before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts by officers of the Department. Mr Nettle had access-as do other members of the public or Public Service-to the Committee. He sought to make a submission. The Committee granted him the right to make a submission to rebut what he considered to be the very serious charge that he was responsible for deleting material from a submission to a Minister. That proved to be a satisfactory way in which he was able to put his case.
        </para>

       <para>
        Throughout the system it is possible for members of the public and the Public Service to approach the Privileges Committee if something is said in Parliament or if evidence is given to a parliamentary committee which may bring their reputations into disrepute. My experience as a member of parliamentary committees is that such people have the full right to do so. Mr Henderson used that right before an Estimates committee to rebut something that was said in the Parliament. But in so doing he said he had no access as a public servant to rebut what he considered to be wrong. Members of the public are at the wrong end of comments made in the Parliament from time to time-sometimes rightly and sometimes wrongly. They are not fully aware of their rights under the law to rebut charges. I suggest that as far as Mr Henderson is concerned, and public servants in general, this matter and the sequence of these events ought to be brought before the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Primmer made the comments in the Senate, and he as a member of parliament has the right to make those comments and to be protected by very necessary privilege in making such comments. Otherwise there would be little exposure of the wrongs that need to be exposed. The fact that Senator Primmer is subject to these writs seems to me to indicate that the matter ought to be referred. I do not think that any honourable senator who makes comments in this place ought to be intimidated by writs or by the threat of writs. I do not mean to say that if the senator or member is proved to be greatly in error the Parliament, through its Privileges Committee, should not take up the matter and impose some discipline upon the member concerned. However, the right of privilege is an essential and powerful right which the Parliament demands in the interests of the people. That right should not be diminished in any way.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our remarks have been free ranging. If I were in the chair I possibly would try to bring the Committee back to the matter in question. However, the matter is far too important to be allowed to pass and I suggest that those of us who are in a position to bring the matter before the Privileges Committee should do so.

         —It certainly was not my anticipation that this matter would be brought up in Estimates committee hearings, but as it was I think I should have something to say. If we refer to page 144 of the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee D of Friday, 10 September we will see in part what Mr Henderson said in relation to the allegations which I made about the Tehran Embassy. Mr Henderson said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        First of all, only one officer has ever been involved-that is Mr Witheford. No others have come forward. No evidence has been produced other than that from Mr Witheford. The officers mentioned by Senator Primmer have made it clear that they do not support Mr Witheford's allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I completely and absolutely deny that. This saga has taken on the proportions of Blue Hills. To my mind it is very similar to the meat scandal which has just been finalised by a royal commission. It took three and a half years for the facts that I mentioned in March 1978 to come out and ultimately to be proved to be true. That does not worry me at all; I take no pride in and want no thanks for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it is interesting to note that in both instances-in the case of the meat scandal and in the case of the Tehran Embassy-there originally were ministerial denials of any impropriety. I suggest also that there were and are cover-ups in both cases. Again in both cases people, through fear of persecution, did not at first come forward to speak-until the royal commission was established in the case of the meat scandal. They feared for their jobs and perhaps they feared to some extent for their health.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to note that in this case people have been prepared to stand up to be counted despite what they perceived might be the consequences. People are coming out of the woodwork in this issue. I shall refer to something that happened in recent times. On or about 17 September of this year I received a letter from a Mr R. E. Johns, of 9 Rankin Street, Campbell. What comes through from Mr Johns's letter is that he was an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs. In part, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 840 at the top of the second column and contained in a letter from Witherford to Lucus A.F.P. the inference is given that I had withdrawn or amended certain of my previous statements. This is incorrect . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        When I was subsequently interviewed by the Australian Federal Police I can assure you I made no withdrawal of the signed Finance Committee statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        That letter flies in the face of everything that Mr Henderson implied in his statement to the Senate Estimates Committee. I would not know Mr Johns if he walked into the chamber now. That letter came to me completely unsolicited. As I said, people are coming out of the woodwork and supporting the contentions that I put forward in this place, the contentions that Mr Witheford and others have made.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only last week further information came to me. It requires further checking, and I will be doing that. This information comes from people outside the Department of Foreign Affairs, who have no links whatsoever with the Department as did my original informant. They have no relationship whatsoever to the Department of Foreign Affairs. It seems that the whole nation, or many people in this country are aware of what has been going on and are now starting to come out and make themselves heard about this issue.

I ask questions now in order that I might understand what stage this matter has reached. I seek an explanation as I was unable to be at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing. This is one of the problems honourable senators face now with the changed arrangements. Questions such as these ought to be asked at the Estimates Committee level and not in the Committee of the Whole because advice is not then available in depth and it is much more difficult to get a response. Nevertheless, this is the only opportunity I have to ask the following questions. What is the stage and nature of the proceedings which are before the court in which an employee of the Department is suing officers of the Department? What is the nature of the counsel provided to the departmental officers? Is it of a substantial and expensive nature to the point of possible intimidation of the person bringing the complaint, who is faced with the possibility of having to meet extensive costs because of the nature of counsel engaged by the officers of the Department in their defence which is paid for by the Department? They are the questions I now raise. The public purse is now supporting expensive counsel in defence of officers of the Department against a plaintiff who is an employee of the Department and who has to meet her own costs . I identify that person by using the word 'her'. I ask the Minister whether I can get those answers either in a general form now or in particular form later.

         —I wish to raise a number of brief points during the debate on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs. Before I do, I want to make one point clear in connection with the case about which Senator Jessop was talking, as I missed the opportunity to do so the first time I spoke. I refer to the fact that Ministers name the witnesses who appear before Estimates committees. I believe that the Minister, therefore, would be responsible for those witnesses and for what they say. When Senator McIntosh and I arrived in this chamber we heard what Senator Primmer had to say about Mr Henderson's evidence. We do not know which one is correct. I suppose that we can ask them independently. If the proposal is that Estimates committees will be able to call witnesses other than those who are nominated by the Minister and who can be questioned by senators-I instance the case in question-that is something that should be debated in this chamber and with which I will go along. Until that situation occurs I believe that somebody such as Senator Primmer can be placed in a very difficult position when circumstances arise as they arose at our recent Estimates committee meeting.

        I refer now to another matter completely. Along with other members of the Senate I receive regular statements issued from the Iranian Embassy in Canberra. I must say that they contain some of the most outrageous descriptions and ideas that one could possibly see. Rarely do these tirades produced by the Embassy make sense but the general gist is obvious. I would just like to give a couple of examples of the type of rubbish emanating from the Embassy and explain why I think perhaps something more ought to be done with these documents than just throwing them in the wastepaper basket as I first started to do. A dispatch dated 7 September begins:
       </para>
       <para>
        With the interests of imperialism in jeopardy after the fall of the Shah and the expulsion of the great satan from Iran an attempt was made to save the collaborators of the satan from prosecution for the crimes committed by them and to settle each group of spies and adherents of the great satan in various countries suited to their particular circumstances. One of these groups: Baha'i zionism, whose members have lately been dubbed as Iranian refugees, in their so- called international conference, disparaged the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. For months ground was being prepared for this conference by the agents of zionism through mass media and a false impression was created that these so- called refugees were comparable to the Palestinian and Lebanese refugees as well as to the thousands of other oppressed people of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a dispatch dated 22 September relating to the Iran-Iraq war a similar tone prevails:
       </para>
       <para>
        This was not to be the end of American conspiracies against Iran and the world imperialism and zionism found an all too willing and faithful proxy in the mercenary leaders of Baathist Iraqi regime to run the gauntlet for the great satan. Thus Iraqi aggressors launched their naked armed attack on Iran on 22 September, 1980 and for this signal treachery against a neighbouring Muslim country were rewarded by their masters. The name of Iraq, which once the list of world terrorists, was removed from that list and supply of military hardware to its expansionist regime resumed by America and her satellites. No expense or effort was spared to strengthen this facist regime in its unprovoked aggression against Iran.

I believe that in those circumstances I am quite entitled to raise them again. I ask the Minister: What is Australia doing about the treatment that is being given to the Baha'is in Iran and the fact that these types of letters are being sent to not only members of parliament but also other people in the Australian community? I raised this matter because we have a very large Arabic community in Sydney. Statements such as these can cause only trouble. Sydney also has followers of the Baha'i faith and a large temple. I believe that statements such as these only inflame passions amongst those in the Arabic community in Sydney. I was informed that Australia had made representation to the Iranian Government over the treatment of the Baha'is but I received no information as to whether the Government would take steps to curtail these outlandish letters. I believe that officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs have raised the issue of these newsletters with Iranian officials in Canberra. I want to know what progress has been made.

One could imagine the incidentals item not being sufficient to cover their costs if the case went on long enough. I do not know who this person who is appealing against a promotions decision is, but it seems that unless this person has some access to legal aid, he or she could finish up being financially embarrassed to say the least if he or she is up against four officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs who are being financed by the taxpayers. This person would have to find his or her own financial wherewithal. Could we get some figures on this matter?

         —Briefly, the matter I raise now is concerned with the vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs. Maybe you, Mr Chairman, will rule that this is a matter that should be raised in the Committee of the Whole. It relates to grants totalling some $646m provided through the Australian Development Assistance Bureau as aid to other countries. Some $264m is to be allocated to Papua New Guinea. Roughly $283m, the remainder, is to be allocated to other countries including the Philippines and, in my view, to other dictatorships and fascist regimes to our north. It seems from the way that the Marcos regime is carrying on in the Philippines at the moment, with the framing, in my view, of an Australian Catholic priest and the incarceration of other Christians working amongst the deprived people, that it is time Australia had a long hard look at the countries to which it gives its foreign aid and why.

         —Most members of parliament receive the Australian Foreign Affairs Record. I think that unfortunately it has become a record of Government speeches and statements on foreign affairs. It really duplicates Backgrounder, which is also put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs. During the Estimates Committee hearings I asked the officers whether the Government had given any consideration to commissioning articles for the Australian Foreign Affairs Record to give it some more spark and to make it more interesting, as it used to be. Unfortunately, I was informed that some articles had been written by people outside the Department but that its funding does not make allowance for the commissioning of articles. I think that that is something that should be looked at in the future.

        It was also noted when the Committee was going through the appropriations that a sum of $10,000 had been allocated for consultants. It intrigued me what sort of consultants the sum related to. On inquiry I was told that the sum was specifically for the engagement of a consultant to prepare reports on North- South issues, but at the time no more information was forthcoming on the specific details. I have always felt that the term 'North-South' is somewhat vague and in need of clarification. I was sorry that the officer who answered my question could not give me at the time any more details of the consultant's work . I would be interested to know what sort of reports are being prepared, who will use them and why in the whole of the Department of Foreign Affairs there is not the expertise to prepare the sort of work that this consultant is preparing.

        I was also surprised to see that Australia is still making a contribution to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The amount is shown as approximately $3.4m. It seems to me that with the current position in Lebanon there is little reason for the Force to be still in operation. The Committee was informed by one of the Foreign Affairs officers that UNIFIL was now operating on a two-month review basis with the expectation that each renewal might be its last. Since it is clear that the UNIFIL is redundant, I believe that it is quite ridiculous for us to be spending these large sums of money to keep it in operation.

         —I wish to raise one other issue. It concerns language training. I took the opportunity during the Committee hearings to discuss the levels of language training available to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and to staff members embarking on overseas duty. I was led to believe that the level of foreign language expertise in the Department is low, especially in the consular and administrative ranks. It is the people within these ranks who when they are abroad, must deal with local officials such as policemen, merchants and suppliers who may not speak English. Consequently, it is often left to the locally engaged staff to conduct business and sort out local affairs. Stenographers who are going abroad receive the minimum period of language training, which makes life in a new country very difficult for them. Spouses of officers also do not receive enough language training and often feel inadequate when they have to deal with the local merchants, shopkeepers et cetera on a day-to-day basis.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, the language allowance incentives are not high enough to encourage Foreign Affairs staff to take on learning a new language. I was quite surprised to find out during the hearings that this language allowance is taxable. I think that is scandalous. The officers present at the Estimates hearings agreed on the importance of our overseas staff having language backgrounds and skills. They stressed the difficulty of mastering some languages as well as the importance of trainees having a genuine commitment to mastering a new language. However, I still believe that more training should be made available to staff setting out for overseas posts, that higher language allowance incentives should be instituted and that these incentives should not be taxable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Foreign Affairs officer stated that it was extremely important to have trusted, locally engaged staff members who can handle affairs between locals and officials. That is something I would certainly agree with. Unfortunately we cannot always expect locally engaged staff to put their loyalty to the Australian Government before their loyalty to their own countrymen and women. This issue of foreign language training is something that should be looked at by the Department in the near future.

         —I wish to raise an item in relation to the Adult Migration Education Service that exists in all States of Australia and to ask questions of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) on this matter. The Adult Migrant Education Service is, I believe, for those people who have any contact with it, an essential service in all States for migrants to enable them to familiarise themselves with the English language which is an essential tool to be able to operate within our society.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The point I wish to raise is in relation to the permanency of the teachers within this Service. The Service has been provided from Commonwealth funds to the States who employ various teachers for this particular Service. It has been operating now in most States for over 30 years and yet we still find an extraordinary situation in relation to the migrant service and the permanency of staff. I will give an example: In New South Wales 600 teachers are employed on a casual, hourly paid, basis. Over 200 of these teachers are employed full time. In other words, we have operating in New South Wales over 200 full time casual teachers. This is a most extraordinary situation because the full time casuals, which is a most extraordinary sort of industrial categorisation in itself, are expected to do exactly the same job as permanent officers and yet they receive none of the benefits. They are regularly sacked and rehired whenever holidays occur, so that there is no holiday pay and there are no superannuation benefits or any of the other benefits which attach to permanency. If that were not bad enough, the item that flows from this is that the quality of that service must necessarily be seriously diminished by the fact that many of these highly qualified people who are engaged in teaching are on that delicate edge. Necessarily enough these people who have other commitments must leave at a time when they can receive a permanent appointment elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        This matter has gone before the New South Wales Industrial Commission. I will quote the judgment because I believe it is essential to the proposition. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . to the advantage of the students and the efficiency of the Service, at least 150 and perhaps 201 are for all purposes other than pay and conditions working as full-time teachers.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words that fact has been accepted by the Industrial Commission. It continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        One hesitates to use the word exploit with respect to adult professional teachers in 1982. Nevertheless, it seems clear that a situation has developed, whether intentionally or otherwise, where it might reasonably be said that the conditions of employment result in the casual, full-time teachers subsidising the AMES.
       </para>
       <para>
        That judgment was given on 18 August this year. I ask the Minister: What is the current situation in relation to the funding from the Commonwealth level to the States to enable the States to undertake to employ teachers who are needed as full time teachers on appropriate full time benefits? In other words, they should be employed as of now as permanent officers within that force. Can the Minister make some statement about what the Federal Government intends to do about this matter? We have had the lovely situation of continual buckpassing going on in this country because of the nature of our federation. In this regard the States have said that it is a Commonwealth matter and the Commonwealth has said that it is a State matter. I think immigration and ethnic affairs is undoubtedly a Commonwealth responsibility. This matter falls squarely within that portfolio's responsibility. It is definitely a responsiblity of the Commonwealth Government to provide for that service. I would like a response from the Minister as to what is the current situation. I understand that in recent weeks there has been some movement in this regard. Can the Minister state what the Commonwealth's commitment now is in that area?

         —I would like to address a few remarks to the same subject as Senator Macklin raised but I will try to avoid canvassing the same ground. This issue was raised last week by many representatives of the teachers federations. It is true to say that the Adult Migrant Education Service has been a temporary body for 31 years. From the projected immigration figures for the next five years and the Government's reports it will certainly be around for another five years. The Galbally report-the report of the Review of Post- arrival Programs and Services to Migrants Committee-published in 1978 suggested that the permanent nature of this service should be recognised. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hodges, claims that the Service is permanent but, of course, the only thing that the Government will not do is extend the permanent conditions to the employees. What is happening is that a majority of the employees in all States are being paid wages at the lowest permanent wage rate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I will refer to some of the things that these permanent casuals miss out on. They do not get incremental wages; they do not get recreation leave; they are not paid for class preparation work; and they do not get sick leave, long service leave, leave without pay, study leave or maternity leave. None of the basic conditions that one would expect in an occupation of this type exists. A situation arose in the Victorian Department of Education. I am speaking today on this matter because a similar thing happened to me. The Department introduced a limited tenure teachers system whereby one would be employed up to 18 December, sacked and then re-employed six or eight weeks later.

Therefore I empathise with those people who have been working in this area for three, four or five years as permanent casuals with none of the conditions that I have mentioned. The reason why this situation exists has already been alluded to. The teachers are in an industrial no-man's land in that teachers are employed by the New South Wales Government only as an administrative method but they are totally funded by the Commonwealth. It is true that a certain percentage of the work force in New South Wales-70 in 1976 and another 30 in 1978-has been made permanent. If there were a case for making 20 per cent of the service, of a permanent nature why can we not go to a situation in which at least 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the teachers are employed on a permanent basis, especially those who are teaching full time?

       <para>
        Senator Macklin quite correctly pointed out what Mr Justice Dey had to say when he talked almost in terms of exploitation. Making casual teachers of the Adult Migrant Education Service permanent has been supported by the New South Wales Government, the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales, the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales, the Ethnic Communities Council of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labor Council of New South Wales. The Government cannot expect to provide these services on the cheap . It should provide the teachers with the proper remuneration and conditions. It is effectively asking those teachers to subsidise that service. The Government should cut out the nonsense that this service is a temporary thing. It has been going for 31 years and my guess is that it will be going for at least another decade. I think the Government is really getting by on the cheap. Possibly it is adopting the sorts of industrial policies of the new Liberal leader in Victoria, Mr Kennett, who wants to cut out all other conditions and have a base salary for employees. I hope the Commonwealth Government does not want to be tarred with the brush of Mr Kennett.

I have also received representations from the Teachers Federation. I wish to put two questions. I think they have been partly covered by the previous two speakers, but I am not certain. The first is: What funds will be allocated for the conversion of all 201 full time casual positions in the New South Wales Adult Migrant Education Service to permanent positions, which is estimated to cost $1.3m? Secondly, has the Government agreed to the provision of funds for the creation of 30 extra permanent teaching positions in the New South Wales AMES? Is it true that the Government is considering the allocation of additional funds for the creation of permanent positions above this figure of 30? If the Government is considering this, what allocation of funds will be provided and what number of permanent positions will result?

         —I do not want to raise the same matter as that raised by Senators Macklin, Sibraa and Robert Ray. I raise the question of enfranchisement for people coming to Australia from any country. It was drawn to my attention, following the recent election in South Australia, when a number of scrutineers from our party and other political parties reported that there was a particularly high informal vote in some electorates which had high ratios of Greek and Italian migrants and that it was caused by the fact that when they voted they simply put a cross in the box next to the name of their most favoured candidate and left the rest of the boxes vacant. As any Australian with any voting experience at all is aware, we do have a plethora of voting methods in this country for local government, State and Federal elections and for upper and lower houses. In local government elections in South Australia it is quite sufficient to put a cross next to the name of the candidate one chooses and in multi-member electorates simply to put crosses next to the required number of people to be elected.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have recently introduced another new voting system for the Legislative Council of South Australia which requires that numbers from one to 11 only need to be placed next to the candidate's name since only 11 people have to be elected. I might add as an aside that this has caused some problems for the Liberal Party in that it put forward a Legislative Council team of only seven and discovered that about 10 per cent of its voters stopped at seven. The problem is that from State to State and from election to election-that is, from, say, a local government election to a State election to a Federal election-the voting system is different. It seems rather pointless to make Australian citizens of immigrants, thereby giving them the right to vote, if at the next and subsequent elections they invalidate this by voting incorrectly. I ask the Minister whether the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will consider appropriating an amount of money, if it does not already do so, to provide newly made citizens of Australia with information about the voting systems which apply in Australia so that, having been made full citizens with full rights in this country, they can use those rights appropriately and not inadvertently abuse them.

         —I want to speak very briefly on the Adult Migrant Education Program. There appears to be a presumption at all times that everybody understands English. This is not the case. The Adult Migrant Education Program has been filling the gap, as it were, to prevent those people who came to Australia immediately following the war from sticking in their own little areas only because that was where they could be understood and it meant that they did not have to learn English. There is now a greater awareness that if people intend to take up residence here they do need English as a second language. This question goes from that area of education to everything else. The other day at a meeting of another committee I had to raise a matter concerning the front door of Parliament House. People are required to come through an electronic device and there is a notice in English which states that a person wearing a pacemaker should not go through. But the notice is written only in English. That is being adjusted but it is typical of the attitude in Australia to people who come from other countries. The Government should be paying particular attention to the Adult Migrant Education Program. I believe the opportunity to do something constructive about it is in the Commonwealth Government's hands.

        The other query I want to raise during the consideration of the estimates for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs relates to the problem of people who have been refused an interview in their home country obtaining a visitor's visa to come to Australia and not being able to get an interview while they are in Australia. I refer to some correspondence I had with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in March this year. I wrote to the Minister and gave him all the details. I referred him to the fact that a couple who would be in Australia for some six months on their visitor's visas has, because of their qualifications, been approached with offers of employment. I suggested at that time that it might be possible for them to have an interview while they were in Australia as an interview in Germany had been refused. We had no knowledge of why they had been refused. The Minister's last correspondence to me indicates that the reason was purely and simply that they did not have the skills that were required in Australia. I would dispute that, depending entirely on the amount of opportunities available.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my correspondence to the Minister I stated that it was the couple's intention, if at all possible, to purchase a business. I cannot see that a skill would be required that they would not already have. The situation remains that while they were in Australia for six months surely it would have been competent of someone in the Department to conduct an interview and perhaps make a recommendation to the office in Germany that their application for migration should at least be considered in a favourable light. That would have meant that no additional expense would have been involved. That matter was raised in the letter of the now Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) which has the reference number 82/8796-0924K. The letter is not dated so I cannot tell honourable senators when it was written, but it certainly arrived in my office prior to the departure of this couple from Australia to return to Germany.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not the first time I have had occasion to raise matters such as this with either the current Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs or the previous Minister. It would seem to be a relatively simple matter to adjust. If a person applies for immigration in another country-in this instance the application was made in Germany-the Minister informed me that they would have occasioned some considerable expense in having to travel to the relevant centre to be interviewed. I suggest that only they could have made that decision. If they were serious about their application they would have taken that into consideration prior to their putting in that application. Nevertheless, they have now returned to Germany. It was never envisaged that they would not do so. My correspondence with the Minister was undertaken on the basis that they would have to return as they owned property in Germany and they would be required to sell their house in order to have a fairly substantial sum of money to enable them to come to Australia and, if necessary, to purchase a business.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is incumbent on us as a relatively new country to make it as easy as posible for those people who are interested in coming to Australia and setting up a business-thereby creating further employment for Australian people-to be given every opportunity to do so. This does not appear to be the case at the moment. I wonder whether the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) who is in charge of the chamber can give me some indication of what is Government policy on this matter so that I can know whether I am simply wasting my time writing letters when people are already in Australia on visitor' s visas or whether I should simply wait until they return to their country of origin and then make representations.

         —I want to endorse the remarks made by Senator Macklin, Senator Robert Ray and Senator Sibraa. Normally I would have spoken on that topic but I think the remarks made by those three honourable senators canvassed that topic very well. Therefore, I intend to make a few remarks this evening about charges imposed on overseas students in Australia. Some people might query why I am commenting about charges for overseas students under this vote, but the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs collects the charges from these students. In making these remarks I refer to an article in the 8 November 1982 issue of the Christian Science Monitor headed 'Don't pull Economic chair out from under foreign students'. It deal with overseas students and United States colleges and universities. Some of the things that it says are relevant to Australia. The article claims that the United States makes a valuable contribution to other nations through the training of foreign students. It states that that contribution is probably more valuable than other forms of aid, including foreign aid, military assistance and foreign investment. The article states that the vast majority of foreign students in the United States come from poor countries. These students undertake studies in subjects such as business, science and engineering which are directly related to the development of their home countries. It is stated that the majority of foreign students studying in the United States pay their own way, although the article argues that students who have leadership potential but who do not have financial resources to study in the United States should receive aid from American universities, foundations, corporations and government agencies.

       <para>
        After dealing with these matters, the article compared United States funding of foreign students with the funding undertaken by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and said that, in comparison, the level of United States funding is minuscule. The level of the Soviet Union's commitment is said to reflect its recognition of the potential returns for the financial outlay on overseas student assistance. The article then went on to contrast this with the attitude in several Western countries which are 'shortsightedly . . . introducing discriminatory tuition charges'. Part of the article, which contains some critical comments about Australia, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Britain now charges foreign students, on the average, three times as much as it does British citizens. As a consequence, new enrollment by foreign students has dropped 25 per cent, and applications have fallen by 50 per cent since 1979-80. France has raised fees substantially for all foreign students except those from Francophone countries. Foreign students studying in Quebec pay more than four times as much tuition as Canadian students, and Australia has introduced discriminatory university fees as well.

         —I am not sure whether I mentioned it, but Australia has thus acquired an international reputation as a nation which discriminates against foreign students. I would like to mention what these charges are. The charges were introduced on 1 January 1980, and the basic charge then for a student from overseas was $1,500. For a student undertaking a medicine, dentistry or veterinary science course the charge was $2,000. A student undertaking either a master of arts degree or a doctorate of philosophy paid $2,500. These charges were increased at the beginning of 1982 to $1,700 for the basic charge, $2,200 for the medicine, dentistry and veterinary class and $2,500 for the MA or PhD student. These charges will be increased at the beginning of 1983. The figure of $2,500 that I mentioned will remain constant but the others will increase to $1, 850 and $2,350. I have given the charges that are currently being paid and the ones that will be paid at the beginning of 1983. I understand that if the Government is to review these charges it will have to look at the receipts that come from such charges. Last year the receipts were $7,254,833 and this year they are estimated to be $12,020,000.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In comparison with the education budget of $604,713,000 the charges we are imposing on overseas students are fairly small. They are fairly small in the Budget context but fairly major for those students who have to pay the charges. I believe it is time the Australian Government stood back and objectively viewed this situation. A more humanitarian approach towards overseas students and potential overseas students would not only assist other nations but also bond life-long friendships abroad for Australia.

         —I wish to make some remarks about the delays in the London office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The Estimates Committee which dealt with this Department was reassured by Mr Menadue that the unacceptable delays at the London office for people wishing to migrate to Australia or people just wishing to get visitor's or working visas have been somewhat resolved. However, it would appear to me that there is still a large number of delays. I do not have to point out to honourable senators tonight that it is definitely to Australia's advantage economically if we can attract large numbers of visitors who are happy to spend money and have a holiday in Australia. Unfortunately, the staffing procedures in London leave a lot to be desired. Apparently there is an arrangement now whereby temporary staff can be employed to cope with unexpected peaks in the work load. I have been given the strong impression that the work load in London is permanently at peak levels with staff being unable to cope adequately. I know the Government is attempting to enforce stringent economic cut-backs but the lack of staff to handle migration and visa applications both overseas and in Australia has been apparent for some years. Surely the Government could grant this Department more money to be spent in increasing the number of permanent staff, particularly in the London office. We get constant complaints in our electoral offices about the sorts of delays that I have referred to tonight.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I was amazed to learn that the Department was surprised by the numbers of people who took advantage of the new migrant selection system introduced in July . It has admitted to not having had enough staff to deal with the inquiries and the applications. In fact, 33,000 applications for sponsorship under the new program had been received as at the end of August. I certainly would not call myself an expert in the migration area, but even at my office in Dee Why, a suburban office in Sydney, there were many inquiries about the new scheme for weeks before it was introduced. Furthermore, officers from the Department in Sydney knew how popular the scheme would be because they asked my office to warn constituents that they should wait a few weeks before collecting the new forms from the Sydney office because the queues would be terrible. They were right, the queues stretched for hundreds of metres in those early weeks. I sometimes wonder what sort of research is undertaken by the Department before a scheme such as this is implemented. Obviously, in this case it was not enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the subject of inadequate staffing, I make the point that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hodges, has apparently decided to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants here and those visitors who are illegally working. Whilst Mr Menadue acknowledged that increased staffing will be required , no allowance has been made for it in the Budget as far as I can see. He informed us that approaches have been made to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the subject and that additional funding will be pursued. Nevertheless , I do not understand how the Minister can make such strong announcements without any backing either in the way of increased funding or increased staff. It is clear, in Sydney anyway, that the immigration staff are snowed under. I cannot see the likelihood of more duties being distributed without the work suffering even further.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I endorse Senator Haines's remarks concerning electoral reform and the need for the Government to spend some money on explaining certain aspects of the systems that apply in Australia at present. Electoral reform at a Federal level has been promised by three former Ministers. The New South Wales Government brought about a number of changes. We brought in the optional preferential system to vote for the members of the Legislative Council, the upper House. One has to vote only for the team put forward by one's party, plus one, for that vote to be formal. If a mistake is made in the ballot paper, it is counted up to the point of that mistake occurring. I believe that even though it would probably be better to have a list system, whereby a vote for one candidate would be a vote for the full team, at least this reform has been a good reform. For the lower House in New South Wales now one has to vote for only one person and, as was ruled last time, one has to put only a cross against the name of the candidate for whom one wishes to vote for that vote to be counted as a formal vote. That has reduced dramatically the informal vote in New South Wales elections for both Houses. But I do not believe that we shall get electoral reform from this Government because its members believe that the Senate system, the one in which we have to vote for all candidates at present, helps the conservative parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Returning to Senator Haines's point, the Government believes that by making people of Greek, Italian or Yugoslav origin, to name just three groups, fill out a ballot paper on which they have to fill in every single number, when some of them are illiterate in their own language as well as in English, works to the Government's advantage. One has only to look back at the scandalous events of 1974 where in New South Wales one had to vote for 73 candidates for the Senate, and over 12 per cent of the vote was informal, to realise why this Government has not done anything about it. In 1975 in New South Wales there was a complete recount of the Senate vote. It was the first complete recount ever held.

         —Yes, the right person won it. I took a very close interest in it , because I was the person concerned. It showed the scandalous inadequacies of the present voting system because when the vote was recounted, whilst the margin by which I won rose from 854 to 2,016, the total informal vote dropped by about 12,000. There were 12,000 more informal votes found when the system was gone through for the third time. If it had been counted again, we would probably have got a different result again. We in New South Wales were determined that this situation would not happen again. We have run a very strong scrutineering campaign in every electorate division in New South Wales aimed at bringing down the informal vote. We have been able to do that at three elections in a row. The South Australian branch embarked on the same sort of campaign last time and was successful in reducing the informal vote in eight of the nine electorates in South Australia. We started a campaign on this subject in Western Australia this weekend. The Australian Labor Party is determined to do as much as possible not to have the system working against it. But we shall get proper electoral reform only by changing the Government and by changing the electoral legislation.

         —I thank the chamber for the Committee debate on the estimates for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Some senators have taken the opportunity to make comments. Some have restated matters that were dealt with in the Estimates Committee. A number have raised points on which I am able to provide information . I can advise Senator Macklin that $300,000 has been provided in the 1982-83 Budget for the States to increase the levels of teacher permanency. We are aware of the concern in other States but New South Wales is the only State so far to make a formal approach on the permanency question. As far as teacher permanency in New South Wales in general is concerned there is some information that I could provide for Senator Macklin or I could seek to have these comments incorporated in Hansard so they will be available for other honourable senators if they are interested in the facts.

        Senator Haines asked about the provision of funding for information on the voting system. A booklet is to be produced in 1983 which will provide information, amongst other things, on voting systems-as recommended by the evaluation of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs on the Galbally programs. I am sure that booklet will be of great assistance. Senator Coleman raised a matter in regard to visas. I think I can only note many of the things that were mentioned by Senator Coleman. Perhaps we ought to note too that when visitors apply for visas they sign a declaration to the effect that they will not seek to remain in Australia, not seek permanent residence while they are in Australia and not engage in employment in Australia. It is important that these provisions be adhered to in order to retain control of our migration program. I will see that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) is informed of the matters raised by Senator Coleman and the points she put forward this afternoon.

        Senator Colston raised the matter of charges for overseas students. I think it ought to be stated that the charges for overseas students were introduced from 1 January 1981 and represented around only 40 per cent of the total average current educational costs at universities and colleges of advanced education. An adjustment of around 10 per cent in 1982 covered to a partial extent the increases in educational costs at that time. A further adjustment of around 7.7 per cent from 1983 will reduce the impact of inflation and recover some 33 per cent of the total average recurrent costs being met by the Commonwealth for overseas students attending universities, colleges of advanced education and certain advanced education courses at other institutions. As I understand it charges have not deterred overseas students from studying in Australia and in fact numbers have continued to increase. By requiring some contribution from overseas students Australia can assist additional students to study in Australia without substantially increasing the cost to the Australian taxpayer. I think it has been noted that in most countries there is a charge for study at tertiary level.

        Senator Sibraa again raised the question of processing delays in the London office. My officers advise me that systems have been streamlined and visitor visa processing is up to date. There are still delays in migrant processing, with many more migrants applying than are eligible, but I think the streamlining and the catching up is working satisfactorily at present. Of course, there always will be surges of inquiries from people wanting to come to Australia. We will deal with them as early as we are able. The matter of operations against illegal workers was also raised by Senator Sibraa. I am advised that additional staffing has already been approved. Of course, with that approval the application for additional funds will also be dealt with in the usual process. Mr Temporary Chairman, I think those were all the matters raised. The Minister will be interested in the debate this afternoon. If there are other matters I have not referred to I suggest that he may write directly to the honourable senators who raised the matters.

        TEACHER PERMANENCY IN NSW
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision of funds for converting 30 casual positions to permanent positions in the New South Wales Adult Migrant Education Service in 1982/83 has been confirmed to the NSW authorities by the Commonwealth. The NSW authorities are arranging for some further permanent positions to be provided by rationalisation of the present arrangements. This will mean that there will be some 140 permanent teachers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The NSW authorities and the Teachers Federation have sought Commonwealth agreement to funding further permanent positions. These proposals need to be considered in a national context to take account of arrangements in the other States and equity of provision for Adult Migrant Education Service teachers in the various States. It is also essential that changes to the present staffing arrangements serve the best interests of migrants needing to learn English and that in the present economic climate the most rigorous consideration be given to proposals for additional funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 25 October the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs wrote to Mr Mulock, the NSW Minister for Education, confirming progress towards establishing the national basis for funding arrangements relating to teacher permanency, but indicating matters which remain to be resolved, including the way in which the Audit Migrant Education Service should be organised to make the most effective use of permanent staff and the improvements in the service which would result. Details are also awaited from the States to complete the national picture. Provided the matters which have been raised with Mr Mulock and other States can be resolved quickly, it should be possible to identify the future permanency arrangements for NSW by mid-December.

         —by leave-I should like to revert to Group C, on which some questions were raised by honourable senators. I have information to provide to the Committee. During the consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) on 11 November Senator Gietzelt made a number of criticisms, allegations and innuendos concerning aspects of the operations of the Australian Electoral Office. I have a report that was received by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) from the Chief Electoral Officer.

        REPLY BY MINISTER FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES TO SENATOR GIETZELT'S CRITICISMS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL OFFICE MADE DURING HIS SPEECH ON THE APPROPRIATION BILL ON 11 NOVEMBER 1982
       </para>
       <para>
        During the debate on the Appropriation Bill last Thursday, 11 November, Senator Gietzelt made a number of criticisms, allegations and innuendos concerning aspects of the operations of the Australian Electoral Office. I have received a report from the Chief Australian Electoral Officer on these matters and as a consequence I can provide a comment in respect of each.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. In the first place, in relation to the conduct of habitation reviews in 1981 /82, Senator Gietzelt stated that he was misled in respect of the amount of review activity undertaken in that financial year. He said, and I quote, ''the reply that was given to me suggested that there was no curtailment of funds in respect of habitation reviews''. In fact, on 6 May in response to the Honourable Senator's question, Senator Baume said, and again I quote, ''because of the limits to which available funds could be spread over the various operations in which the Australian Electoral Office is engaged habitation review activities were reduced in this current financial year''.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. I would not think that the position could have been stated more clearly and that answer, which appears in Senate Hansard of 6 May 1982 page 2006 seems, at least to me, to be totally at variance with what Senator Gietzelt suggested in his criticism of the Minister's reply.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. I would add that far from being kept uninformed about the habitation review activities of the Australian Electoral Office, Senator Gietzelt has this year been provided with an enormous amount of statistical and background information. Furthermore, on the particular point of the reduction in habitation reviews, Senator Gietzelt had it re-affirmed on 8 September 1982 in answer to one of his many questions on this subject that in 1981/1982 there was a limit to funds and that habitation review activity was reduced. He was told specifically that and I quote ''no reviews were conducted in Queensland and Tasmania and percentage reviews only were conducted in New South Wales (67 per cent), Victoria (75 per cent), Western Australia (32 per cent) and South Australia (36 per cent).''
       </para>
       <para>
        5. The financial figures which Senator Gietzelt quoted from the Appropriation Bill of course related to expenditures for the whole item and not specifically for habitation reviews. On this point I add that Senate Estimates Committee C was informed at the time of the additional estimates on 19 April 1982 that savings in this item would be necessary in order to meet expenditure in other areas. This is the explanation to the apparent short-fall in expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. The second point of criticism made by Senator Gietzelt is perhaps more serious in that he has reflected on the probity of an officer of the Australian Electoral Office, a Mr Phillip Lewis who is one of the officers responsible for the conduct of industrial elections in New South Wales. Senator Gietzelt referred to the loss of ballot papers subsequent to the conduct of an election- that is subsequent to the declaration of the result of that election and not during its course.
       </para>
       <para>
        7. It is quite true that section 170A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act requires the person who has conducted an election to preserve and keep for one year after that election all ballot papers and other documents associated with it. It is also true that Mr Lewis was not able to produce for the Federal Court, ballot papers which were used for an APTU election in 1981. It is certainly not established however, as Senator Gietzelt claimed last week, that the ballot papers disappeared whilst the Court was considering the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        8. The position is that the ballot-papers from that election, together with the ballot-papers of the other 22 elections which Mr Lewis conducted in 1981 were bagged and placed in store in the Australian Electoral Office in Sydney at the completion of each of those elections. All bags were labelled with the scheduled destruction date. There was, I am informed, a destruction of scheduled material in January 1982 and again in August 1982. Prior to the August destruction, Mr Lewis has informed the Chief Australian Electoral Officer that he checked to see that no APTU bags were included in the material which was sent to be pulped. The facts therefore suggest that the mistake which clearly occurred was probably in January and on the face of it prior to the Court proceedings being commenced.
       </para>
       <para>
        9. Nevertheless, there was a mistake and additional instructions were subsequently issued to each State Office of the Australian Electoral Office directing a tightening of procedures and drawing this particular unfortunate error to attention.
       </para>
       <para>
        10. However to suggest from this, as Senator Gietzelt does, that Mr Lewis is unfit to carry out his duties as a Returning Officer or that the electoral administration is at fault in continuing to use Mr Lewis as a Returning Officer is, I believe, both unwarranted and unjustified.
       </para>
       <para>
        11. On the third point-and I deal with these in the order which Senator Gietzelt does because this point also deals with habitation reviews-Senator Gietzelt has made the scarcely veiled innuendo that the Australian Electoral Office is biased in the conduct of its habitation reviews. He has asked for an assurance, in the first place, that the habitation reviews will be carried out on a thorough basis and not selectively regardless of the difficulties and that every Member of Parliament will be subject to no fear or favour with regard to the way in which habitation reviews are carried out.
       </para>
       <para>
        12. As has been pointed out on a number of occasions, the Honourable Senator appears to have a misunderstanding about habitation reviews. The aim of these reviews is to help to keep electoral rolls up-to-date by checking current entries on the roll against the names of persons actually living at addresses. The reviews do not operate solely to remove the names of electors from electoral rolls; they are concerned just as much at helping unenrolled but eligible voters have their names placed on the roll.
       </para>
       <para>
        13. The Australian Electoral Office aims to conduct a full habitation review each financial year supplemented of course by the work of Electoral Agents. The Honourable Senator is aware that funds have been sought to conduct a full habitation review in this current financial year. But the Honourable Senator knows that it has not always been possible to achieve this result-this is no secret. He is aware from the information given to him in respect of the last financial year that reviews can be curtailed because, inter alia, of the unavailability of sufficient funds. If circumstances necessitate, reviews must be undertaken or completed on a selective basis. Quite clearly high growth areas such as new housing developments, or areas of high mobility of population, or areas which have been the longest without review will be prime targets. Essentially, however, as the Honourable Senator has been told before, the selection decisions will lie chiefly with the Divisional Returning Officers because of their knowledge of their Divisions. There is no question of fear or favour in any of the operations of the Australian Electoral Office. I think it is unfortunate that the Honourable Senator should even suggest that that could be posible.
       </para>
       <para>
        14. As was said last week, the State Member for Bathurst will be advised of the habitation review work to be undertaken in his area.

         —Also during the consideration of the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services the matter of the payment of travelling allowance to parliamentary officeholders was raised by Senator McLaren. I provide the following information on the matter that was raised in that consideration. During the 1981 calendar year and prior to 1 July 1982 the home base of a Minister for the purposes of travelling allowance was determined by the Remuneration Tribunal as being the home of the Minister unless he nominated otherwise to the Minister for Administrative Services. Certified claims were submitted to the Department of Administrative Services and were processed in accordance with the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Remuneration Tribunal determined, with effect from 1 July 1982, that Ministers nominate to the Minister for Administrative Services their home base which shall be their principal place of residence. Neither the Minister for Administrative Services nor his Department made any recommendations to the Tribunal in this regard.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Ministers and Opposition officeholders have nominated their home bases in writing. The Department of Administrative Services finds no substance in the allegation that Ministers nominated one home base for periods when Parliament was sitting and another for the rest of the year. I have schedules which show the amounts paid to each officeholder in respect of domestic travel allowance and the number of days in respect of which overseas travel allowance has been based. The amounts paid in respect of overseas travel were detailed in answer to parliamentary questions Nos 3467 and 3492 in the House of Representatives, which were asked by Mr P. F. Morris and were answered on 16 September 1982. These are recorded in the House of Representatives Hansard at pages 1611 to 1617.

       <para>
        Claims for travel allowance will vary as between officers for a variety of reasons, including not only the home bases of the officeholders but also their commitments and their periods of travel. Travelling allowance is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Schedules show the domestic travelling allowance, the number of days, the amount paid and the number of days of official overseas travel for all officeholders. I seek leave to have those schedules incorporated in Hansard, Mr Chairman.

         — Another matter was raised with regard to travel by a Minister on the Orient Express. I am advised there is no record of any Minister travelling on the Orient Express. There was also a question, which was revised by Senator McLaren today, with regard to travel on the Rhine. I am advised that the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations answered Question No. 781 on 8 November 1978. I refer to the Senate Hansard of that date for the answer concerned. Another matter which was raised concerned the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair). I have a letter from the Minister for Defence in which he states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        You mentioned to me questions asked by Senator McLaren on page 2296 of Senate Hansard of 11 November. In particular he asked whether special dispensation was given for a 34 Squadron aircraft to land in Sydney after the curfew.
       </para>
       <para>
        The aircraft on which I travelled from Canberra to Inverell and returned was an HS 748. The curfew does not apply to this nor to any other turbo-prop aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I am uncertain of the time the aircraft landed there would have been no need for any dispensation even if the landing time were after curfew.
       </para>
       <para>
        The invitation to the function which I attended was originally sent to our colleague the then Minister for Defence, on 25th February. On my assuming the Defence portfolio that invitation was one returned to me and accepted by me as Minister for Defence.
       </para>
       <para>
        A question was raised, I think by Senator Walsh, with regard to an inquiry into the financial affairs or Mr Denis Horgan. I am advised that the proposal for an early inquiry by an independent person into certain matters relating to Mr Horgan was discussed with Commissioner Costigan, by the Minister for Adminstrative Services and by the Secretary to his Department during the week beginning 18 September 1982. Mr Costigan indicated that he would be available to undertake the inquiry only in his capacity as royal commissioner. The Government concluded that it would not be appropriate for the allegations that had been made in the Parliament to be referred for inquiry in the context of the royal commission. The Government looked instead to an independent lawyer to be nominated by the President of the Law Council of Australia, and, following his nomination, Mr J. W. von Doussa, Q.C., undertook the inquiry.

        A further inquiry was raised with regard to the Budget information program. I refer to a media release by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) on 12 November in which he gave an outline of this program. I seek leave to incorporate that media release in Hansard.

        An information program aimed at ensuring Australians are aware of benefits they are entitled to under the 1982 Budget will start this weekend.
       </para>
       <para>
        Television messages, beginning on Sunday night, will highlight the main Budget measures which came into effect this month. They include cuts in personal tax, home loan interest rebates and changes in Social Security benefit conditions. The public will also be alerted to increased assistance to youth through student schemes and work experience programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The television messages are designed to alert as many people as possible to their entitlements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Detailed information about these entitlements will be given in press advertising starting on Monday, and in complementary radio advertisements expected to start the same day.
       </para>
       <para>
        Supporting the press advertising on housing, information pamphlets on housing will be made available to help people dealing with the public on housing matters to be better able to advise their clients.
       </para>
       <para>
        The information program is expected to cost a total of about $2 million. It will be conducted jointly by the Treasury and the Departments of Education, Employment and Industrial Relations, Industry and Commerce and Social Security.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes it has a responsibility to do all it can to ensure that those who should benefit from Budget programs know what to do to claim those benefits-and that this responsibility is even more pressing where the needy and deprived are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The use of television and radio in the program is in line with recommendations of the Task Force on Departmental Information dealing with disadvantaged persons .
       </para>

        In addition, the need for an information program has been recognised by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button, and the Opposition Spokesman on Social Welfare, Senator Grimes.

         — Further information on this program is also available from the Minister for Administrative Services. His response with regard to the program reads as follows:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Several departments are jointly conducting an integrated advertising campaign in the second half of November drawing the attention of members of the public to their entitlements under a number of Budget measures, most of which became effective from 1 November.
       </para>
       <para>
        The campaign consists of a general TV advertisement briefly highlighting the main measures which came into effect in November-personal tax reductions, home loan interest tax rebates, changes to social security entitlements-as well as increased assistance to youth through student schemes and work experience programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The aim of the television advertisement is to alert as many people as possible to their entitlements.
       </para>
       <para>
        To support the TV campaign there are separate Press advertisements which give details of social security benefits, housing aid and assistance to youth. Each of these advertisements advises the public on how to take further action to obtain their entitlements. Information material in pamphlet form is also being prepared to follow up the Press advertising on housing by assisting people who deal with the public on housing matters to be better able to advise their clients.
       </para>
       <para>
        Total expenditure on advertising for the integrated campaign will be about $2m. Funds are being provided by the participating departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government was aware that the public would need further information on the Budget measures which came into effect on 1 November so that they could, as appropriate to their circumstances, make applications for the various entitlements.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might add that this campaign is consistent with the recommendation of the task force on departmental information that 'due consideration be given to the effectiveness of other than print media in communicating with disadvantaged groups, e.g. radio and television . . .'
       </para>
       <para>
        The need for the program is recognised by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate who claimed people are not being told adequately about Government welfare programs (Senate Notice on Motion No. 28), and by the Opposition spokesman on social welfare, Senator Grimes, who said that 'what is needed is a proper advertising campaign' including the use of television.
       </para>
       <para>
        The advertising campaign is certainly not party political in content or purpose . However, since it deals with matters related to the Budget it was considered proper to have the identification required by sub-section (1) of section 117 of the Broadcasting and Television Act regarding material relating to a political subject or current affairs for broadcasting or television.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would emphasise that there is a great difference between advertising of a party political nature and that which is concerned with advising people of their entitlements under the Budget-which, of couse, comes within the category of 'a political subject or current affairs'.

Those estimates were passed by the Committee last Thursday. If any honourable senator wishes to seek a recommittal of the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services, I suggest that that might be in order.

         —I raise a matter which was brought to my attention by a local pharmacist, Mr Kevin Keep, who is a practising chemist with a pharmacy in Devonport. He brought to my attention the question of the introduction of a new concessional pharmaceutical benefits scheme on 1 January with the concurrent requirement that pensioners and others who are entitled to a concession fill out a declaration on the back of the prescription form. I want to make two or three points in relation to this declaration: Firstly, in relation to the beneficiaries of the pharmaceutical benefit-pensioners and those holding health care cards-secondly, in relation to the chemists and, finally, in relation to the Parliament because I think in all respects this declaration form and the manner in which the Government has gone about its imposition on the community are to be deplored.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have a copy of the declaration form which is to be superimposed on the backs of ordinary prescription forms. It is quite evident that the information and the manner in which it is set out-it is computer readable-are such as would prove quite daunting to an elderly pensioner, perhaps of failing eyesight who, up until now, has been able to get a prescription without the bureaucratic hassles that will be involved in filling out this form. Previously, merely to give his card number was considered sufficient. In fact, on the front of every prescription form there is a space for the filling in of the pension number by the doctor in consultation with the patient at the time of prescribing the medicine. But the superimposed form of declaration on the back of the doctor's prescription pads is, as I say, in a form which is quite daunting to the average pensioner or health care card holder. One can well surmise, as my colleague Senator Grimes, the shadow Minister for Social Security has pointed out, many migrants and Aboriginals might be intimidated by the prospect of filling out this highly bureaucratic form in standard English which is naturally required, or in understanding it. For example, a community pharmacist in Moree, 30 per cent of whose customers are Aboriginals, has stated that there is no way that they will sign such a form because, in his view, the Aboriginals will see these forms as an expression of authority and intimidation which, from their cultural point of view, will make it difficult for them to comply. Even more so, how will the 400,000 people who are estimated by the Galbally report to have little or no fluency in English, be expected to fill in the form. The adult literacy report stated that half a million Australians are functionally illiterate. These are the people who will be confronted with the requirement to fill in this form which, at the bottom-if they can read it or have it explained to them-states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Penalty for false or misleading Declaration: $1,000 and/or imprisonment for 6 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        We, who have a sophisticated understanding of the enabling Bill, know that that penalty of $1,000 and/or imprisonment for 6 months is applicable only if a person knowingly or willingly makes a false or misleading declaration. But that is not what is said at the bottom of the form. I believe that, for the ordinary average person, dependent on pharmaceutical benefits or able to have accesss to them under the provisions of the legislation, to see on the bottom of the form ' Penalty for false or misleading declaration $1,000 and/or imprisonment for six months', would frighten them and raise in their minds the possibility that a mere slip, a mistake, which would make the declaration objectively false, could expose them to the dangers of those penalties.

        In relation to chemists, it is quite clear that chemists will bear the administrative burden of filling in this form. The pensioner, the functionally illiterate person or the migrant Australian seeking these benefits will ask the chemist to help him or her fill in this form. That will add a tremendous administrative burden to the paper work already undertaken by chemists in relation to the clerical processing of national health prescriptions and it will also, of course, disrupt the flow of work and the dispensing of medicines by pharmaceutical chemists. This is something which the Government does not seem to have taken into account in imposing this burden and in exposing itself to the payment of further moneys to the chemists by way of recompense for the time spent in helping beneficiaries to fill in this form. Some expenditure will be required by the Government in order to meet the claims that undoubtedly will come from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia seeking appropriate recognition of the cost involved to chemists in helping pensioners to fill out this form. In fact, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has already made submissions to the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton). In its national newsletter of 8 November 1982 it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the Guild's extensive personal and written representations to retain the existing system, legislation providing for the introduction of the concessional benefit and for the declaration form was passed by Parliament on October 28, 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        My only regret is that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia did not confer with the shadow Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, and certainly, as far as I understand it, not with the ordinary Opposition back benchers with a view to alerting us to the difficulties it foresaw in the production of a declaration form in the way in which it has emerged. It is in relation to the emergence of that form and the responsibility of Parliament in regard to it that I think the most cogent criticism of the Government's handling of this matter can be made. Clause 26 of the Bill-new section 84AA (7)-states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister may, by instrument in writing, set out a form to be the prescribed form for the purposes of this section.
       </para>
       <para>
        New sub-section (8) states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A copy of an instrument made under sub-section (7) shall be published in the Gazette.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that to my knowledge that declaration form has never been gazetted as required by the Parliament-it may have happened in the last four or five days -yet it has been circulated by the Department of Health, as I have said, and is now in place on the back of the prescription pads of many doctors through Australia. Indeed, my information is that the declaration form placed on the back of doctors' prescription pads was circulated to the doctors before the Parliament passed the enabling legislation. Certainly, as I said, it was circulated without the form being gazetted as required by this Parliament. There has been a most arrogant assumption by the bureaucracy, either condoned by the Minister or unbeknown to him, and therefore a question mark is raised over his competent management of the bureaucracy. It is quite clear that the Department of Health went ahead and circulated this declaration form without giving to members of Parliament and the community an opportunity to see it in the Gazette and, as I understand it, even before the enabling legislation was passed. It makes the television program Yes Minister pale into insignificance when one sees the manipulation and the pre-empting of the Minister, the Government and the Parliament in this way by the bureaucracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that somewhere along the line, either this evening or in the course of the next day, some explanation is given of that remarkable situation. The conclusion is that a form has emerged which, as I said, quite improperly and without complying with the procedures laid down by this Parliament, has been circulated and which on inspection proves to be intimidating to beneficiaries and cumbersome in the methods that it imposes on chemists to aid, as undoubtedly they will be required to aid, those who are meant to fill them out. The Government ought to withdraw this particular form of the declaration and ought to engage in the fullest consultation not only with the Pharmacy Guild, the professionals concerned, but also with the representatives of those organisations which have as their members those persons who most commonly make use of the pharmaceutical benefits system; that is, the pensioners and others who generally use the health care card system. Then there should be a gazettal of a new form, if a form is still required, in good time to allow the community and parliamentarians to review it and scrutinise it. Altogether, this is a fairly sorry story of bureaucratic indifference to those who might be affected by the requirement that this form be filled in subject to quite severe penalties . I hope that the Minister and the Government will take remedial action at the earliest opportunity.

         —I say at the outset that I do not need a ministerial response to the remarks I am going to make. I want to take this opportunity of making some remarks about the comments the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) made last week. Last Thursday unemployment figures for October were released. These figures show that Australia's unemployment is now at a record level. Unfortunately new record levels seem to have been set every month recently. But now we have well over half a million unemployed with many more people opting out of the work force. There is a real fear abroad. Those who speak to people who are in semi-skilled occupations or unskilled occupations are aware of this real fear that people's jobs are, or could be, at risk. This is a fear amongst the employed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I mentioned that these figures came out last Thursday. The following morning the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs announced that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will issue 31,000 visas in 1982-83 to fill gaps in the job market. Those who are unemployed or those who are fearful for their jobs might ask: What jobs are these people going to fill? The Courier-Mail on 13 November had a heading on page 1 which read 'Migrants get 31,000 jobs'. The article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Immigration Department will issue an estimated 31,000 visas in 1982-83 to fill gaps in the job market, the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Minister, Mr Hodges, said.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hodges was reported to have said the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        'Even in times of high unemployment, there are shortages in certain key occupations and regions . . .'
       </para>
       <para>
        He also stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the labor shortage category, we estimate that 31,000 visas will be issued in 1982-83 . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Many people were alarmed at seeing this article in the newspaper when we have so many people in Australia unemployed. Initially the report suggested that we were going to have 31,000 visas issued for people to come into Australia to take jobs that apparently could not be filled by Australians at that time. Surely we could obtain workers for certain key regions from unemployed Australians. One of the comments of Mr Hodges was that there will be shortages in certain key occupations and regions. If we look at the regions we would expect that Australians would be able to fill the vacant positions. It may mean that we have to help relocate certain Australians. If this is the case that help should be given. Where there are shortages in certain key occupations surely we could offer training. As far as I am aware, it costs thousands of dollars to settle a migrant in Australia. I do not know how many thousands of dollars but certainly thousands are required by the community to settle a migrant in Australia. Why cannot these amounts be payable to Australian workers to relocate them where there is a shortage in a certain region or to enable them to attain new skills were these skills are in short supply?
       </para>
       <para>
        Following criticism by a Queensland Government Minister, Mr Hodges today has apparently retracted a little. This morning's Courier-Mail states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Immigration Minister, Mr Hodges, defended the intake of skilled migrants and said it was a pity the Queensland Government did not help ensure more people became involved in the training programs provided by the Federal Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apparently, Mr Hodges is blaming the Queensland Government for lack of application in the area of training. If there is a lack of application by the Queensland Government-the Federal Minister was replying to a Queensland Minister -it would seem to me that there should be some effort by the Federal Government to ensure that training schemes are availed of. The Courier-Mail also stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        'Of the 31,000 visas which are granted under the skilled worker category, only 10,000 are for workers and the rest for their spouses and children', Mr Hodges said.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this is the case the headline in the Courier-Mail on Saturday was misleading. It said 'Migrants get 31,000 jobs'. If it was misleading--

        It is understandable that a newspaper would accept that this meant that 31,000 people would come to Australia as workers under these visas. I am not blaming either Mr Hodges or the newspaper but I can understand how this misleading comment would have arisen. Even if there are only 10,000 workers, rather than the 31,000 which it appeared there would be from the headline in Saturday's Courier-Mail, my comments still hold about relocation and providing skills for Australians who are unemployed and looking for work.

         —I will respond briefly to Senator Colston first, and then to Senator Tate. Senator Colston is correct that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hodges, has issued a Press release making clear that the number of skilled workers involved in the program is 10,000 and the 31,000 visas cover families as well. The only point that I would like to make and have on the record is another point made by Mr Hodges today that the State Ministers involved with migrant matters supported fully the proposed 1982-83 migrant intake. They had done this at a meeting of Federal and State Ministers on 10 September this year. That would have included the Ministers from each State-New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland-and, of course, from Labor and non-Labor States. There was agreement about those figures. Let us be quite clear. They are agreed figures which have the support of the Ministers involved. I now turn to the matters raised-

         —Sir William Knox did support the figures at the meeting of 10 September this year with his Labor counterparts from New South Wales and Victoria. Senator Tate raised a number of matters. The Parliament has been debating questions of fraud and overservicing and medical matters in the last few months. There has been considerable criticism of Commonwealth departments because of the procedures which have been used in certain areas. At the moment a procedure is being proposed whereby the payment of large amounts of money by way of certain concessions can be verified so that we can try to ensure that fraud is prevented in another area. The procedure is necessary to prevent fraud occurring. It is not inappropriate that the people who receive the benefit should be required to make some declaration that they have an entitlement to it. While I appreciate the intervention of honourable senators who want to argue that maybe the form of the declaration needs to be improved or that other problems exist, it would help if they would acknowledge at the same time that it is necessary to ensure that those who are receiving the benefit are those who are entitled to it. It is not inappropriate to take steps to prevent fraud occurring. I will not go through all the matters except to say that had Senator Tate approached the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) he would know that the Minister is still examining a nember of matters which were raised in his speech and which went to the form of the document including whether it needs to be approved later on.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think honourable senators are entitled to an explanation about the early release of some prescription pads. I am advised that the printing of the new pads commenced on 20 October. It was expected at that time that the legislation would be passed by the Parliament on 26 October. The contract printer, acting on this advice, sent one batch of supplies for 125 doctors to the road freight contractor on 26 October. He sent the next supplies on 29 October; that is, 125 doctors out of a total of 16,000 doctors in Australia will be receiving the supplies. In the event, the legislation finally passed the Houses on 28 October. The supply process from the printer to the doctor normally averages one week. On my advice it is highly improbable that any doctor received new pads on or before 28 October. The patient declarations on the new pads are headed 'This declaration form does not come into operation until 1 January 1983'. I am advised that there is a need to have a high percentage of National Health Scheme prescription pads with the patient declaration actually available to doctors as at 1 January in order to minimise any inconvenience to patients or pharmacists. It is not a very long period in which to get the forms out. It was thought that an early date for printing and distribution of the new forms was the least wasteful and most economic means of achieving this aim. That is the extent of the advice I hold on that matter. It is obvious how the release occurred. Since the forms do not come into effect until 1 January I think Senator Tate would acknowledge that the other problem he raised is probably of no account because I imagine the procedures will be regularised and proper before that date.
       </para>
       <para>
        I come back to what I said before. We think it is appropriate to have a system that is tight enough to prevent frauds occurring. We hope it will be a system which is not difficult for people to administer. I have looked at the forms. I believe they would be ones that most people could fill in. I am advised that social security forms are written in English and not in many other languages. If any explanation of the forms needs to be done that can be arranged through interpreter services in appropriate languages.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst I can appreciate that honourable senators would be concerned about any errors or deficiencies in the declaration as they see it, it is wrong to attribute improper motives to the Minister or to the Department at a time when questions of preventing fraud in other areas of medical benefits are occupying the time of the Parliament. The system we have had so far has been very loose. The amount of money involved in concessional prescriptions is $300m a year. I think the public is entitled to know that those who should receive the benefits are receiving them and that those who are not receiving them are not, by way of fraud, able to make false declarations to get them. The forms which have been designed aim to achieve that.

       It would not be appropriate to provide information as to whether or not a particular person is being investigated by the Australian Federal Police.

       Mr Hughes had obtained the consent of the trustee of his estate before he left Australia on 15 September 1981 to visit Thailand, on 11 March 1982 to visit New Zealand and on 11 May 1982 to visit Fiji. He returned to Australia from that visit to Fiji on 28 October 1982. Mr Hughes' passport, which had been delivered by him to the Official Receiver in accordance with sub-section 77 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act shortly after he was made bankrupt, was released to him for the purposes of the abovementioned overseas visits.

In order to provide a timely answer to the honourable senator's question, however, officers of my Department in the Torres Strait conducted an informal survey in September. The results of the survey indicate that Torres Strait Islanders are employed on a full-time basis by the following:

Up until 1979, pearling luggers owned by the Nona family of Badu Island recruited divers and deckhands from the western coastal villages of PNG. This practice had ceased by 1979.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Statistics for the period July to September 1982 indicate that an average of 57 claims for sickness benefit are refused per week due to the claimant's failure to establish loss of income.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) Statistics are not routinely maintained on the number of sickness beneficiaries paid at a reduced rate due to the application of Section 113 of the Social Security Act. However, following an examination of computer records, it is estimated that some 13,000 sickness beneficiaries were being paid during September 1982 at the rate applying to single unemployment beneficiaries aged 18 years or over with no dependants. A further 1000 sickness beneficiaries were being paid at other rates which may have been reduced rates due to the application of Section 113.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Some 60 special beneficiaries were identified as having previously had sickness benefits claims refused under Section 113. However, since some States have only recently commenced recording historical information on computer payment system, this figure may be an understatement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) If Section 113 was removed from the Social Security Act, the estimated cost in respect of existing beneficiaries would be to the order of $10 million in a full year; it is not possible to estimate the additional cost which would necessarily follow in that eligibility for sickness benefit would automatically be extended to those full-time students and housewives, who are not normally members of the workforce.

      <para>
       (1) Before a claim for pension or benefit is granted or rejected it has to go through several stages of the administrative process and it is not economically possible to keep a statistical record of every stage. In the pension and benefit systems alone the annual number of new grants reached some 1 1/4 million in the financial year 1981-82. The number of terminations is likewise estimated to be over 1 million. The collection of such data would also interfere with the primary aim of speedy payment of pensions and benefits to all eligible persons.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is therefore clear that the collection of statistical data must be selective . Statistics are kept of those transactions events or characteristics of pensioners and beneficiaries for which there is general demand.

       (1) The Department of Transport and Construction does not own or operate any aircraft. However, the Department does charter Nomad and Rockwell Shrike aircraft for coastal and offshore aerial surveillance in northern Australia. These aircraft are owned by four general aviation companies-H. C. Sleigh Aviation Pty Ltd, Northern Territory Aerial Work Pty Ltd, Air Queensland and Reprographics Pty Ltd. In addition to surveillance charters, the Department does , from time to time, charter light aircraft for aerial work associated with construction activities, where it is cost effective to do so. Because of the vast distances to be covered in the outback, light aircraft are also used on a charter basis by the Department's Regional Offices in Queensland and Western Australia.

      <para>
       Because of reduced demand for tin, a quota system currently operates on tin producers in Queensland. Some smaller operators adversely affected by the quota system have claimed unemployment benefit.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since a condition of the lease held by certain of these miners is that the lessee must work his lease in order to retain it, it is difficult for such persons to meet the qualifications for unemployment benefit, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) the person must be unemployed;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) throughout the period he must be capable of undertaking and willing to undertake suitable paid work; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) he must have taken, during the relevant period, reasonable steps to obtain such work.
      </para>
      <para>
       The miners have now found that they are able to gain exemption from this provision of their lease. Where this exemption is granted, self-employed tin miners may qualify for unemployment benefit subject to the usual conditions.

      <para>
       (1) Special emergency funding to community welfare agencies is available through the Grants to Community Welfare Agencies (Special Assistance) Scheme. Agencies may also be assisted through 'act of grace' payments. Reference is made to the Special Assistance Scheme in the Annual Report of the Department of Social Security and in departmental access manuals, which are available to community welfare agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In the past two years, six organisations have applied for funding from the Special Assistance Scheme. Three withdrew applications and were funded from other programs. One received a grant and two were rejected.

      <para>
       (3) Grants from the Special Assistance Scheme require the joint approval of the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Finance.

      <para>
       Criteria for funding have been developed during the administration of the scheme since 1974.
      </para>
      <para>
       Locally-based community welfare agencies experiencing serious financial difficulties as a result of the economic situation are eligible for assistance. Grants are not usually considered where alternative assistance is provided or available from other government sources. Grants are made on a 'once only' basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Under the Special Assistance Scheme 50 agencies have received grants totalling $536,812 since 1974.

       (1) and (2) The statistical information sought is not routinely held in the Department's statistical systems. At present statistics are in general derived as a by-product of the Department's automatic payment systems. This creates considerable conceptual difficulties for any attempt to derive statistics of benefits granted in respect of rejected pension claimants, for the reason that two essentially independent payment systems are involved. During the mid 1980's the Department is moving towards a complete re-equipment of its computers and computer systems (known as 'Stratplan') which will result in an integrated on- line system covering all clients of the Department. It is anticipated that routine availability of the statistical data sought by the honourable senator would then be reasonably likely.

      <para>
       (1) Payment of age, invalid and widow's pension, supporting parent's benefit, sheltered employment allowance and handicapped child's allowance may be continued pending the hearing and determination of an appeal to a Social Security Appeals Tribunal where the pension, benefit or allowance is to be cancelled or reduced as a result of a decision which involves the exercise of a discretion or the formulation of an opinion.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In order to receive continuity of payment in accordance with this practice, an appeal must be lodged within 14 days of the date of the advice to the pensioner/ beneficiary/allowee of the decision in question. There is an exception in the case of invalid pension where payment will continue if the appeal is lodged within the 3 month period during which payment is usually continued following a decision to cancel.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payment only continues for the time involved in the determination of the appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Payment during any subsequent appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or action under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is a matter for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court of Australia respectively.

       Recommendations on support for research projects under Commonwealth grants schemes are made by independent expert committees established for that purpose. In the case of the proposal referred to by Senator Jones, the Queen Elizabeth II Fellowships and Australian Research Grants Committee (QEFARGC), following an assessment of the merits of Dr Hartwick's project and having regard to the Guidelines for the Australian Research Grants Scheme (ARGS), namely, that applications for support compete on the basis of the excellence of the proposal, recommended that Dr Hartwick receive $9,800 as a renewed grant. The Minister for Science and Technology endorsed this recommendation together with all other recommendations of the Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under Australian Research Grants Scheme (ARGS) rules and procedures, ongoing projects are not supported by renewed grants for more than six years. Dr Hartwick's 1983 grant is the final renewed grant he can receive for that project from the ARGS. He is of course eligible to submit a new project proposal seeking either ARGS support or a Marine Science and Technology Grant if he so wishes.
      </para>

       The conclusion of this project does not signify that the Government has abandoned its involvement in scientific research into controlling the box jellyfish. On the contrary, it will fund research into box jellyfish, or any other worthwhile project, providing it has been assessed and recommended by the appropriate advisory committee.

       (1) No guidelines of the Australian Government Advertising Service prevent the Government from advertising in newspapers selling 2000 or less copies per week. When funding available to departments is sufficient and the use of even the smallest circulation newspapers in both remote and non-remote areas of Australia is appropriate for a Commonwealth Department's advertising subject, then those smaller newpapers can be and are used for Commonwealth Government advertising.

      <para>
       (2) I am aware of the problems of the placements of Commonwealth advertisements in small circulation newspapers such as have been referred to in representations on behalf of the 'Barcoo Independent'. I am also aware that these same problems apply in respect of other small newspapers with similar circulations in remote areas of Australia.

       (3) The whole matter of selection of newspapers in provincial areas, especially those circulating in remote areas of Australia, for Commonwealth Government advertising purposes, is being reviewed within my Department. On some occasions reduction of the size of advertisements can make it possible to spread available funds more widely to a greater number of provincial newspapers. In other cases however reduction of the size of advertisements could make them illegible. Alternative selection options are being investigated.

      <para>
       I ask the Attorney-General whether Mr Clem O'Sullivan, formerly the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth, after retiring from the position of Deputy Crown Solicitor, completed on a contract basis work he had partially completed while on the government payroll. How common is the practice of letting contract work and what procedures apply to its letting? Was Mr O'Sullivan selected to do this work because of his known diligence and administrative ability?

      </para>
      <para>
       After his retirement from the position of Deputy Crown Solicitor, Perth, on 1 May 1978, Mr C. J. O'Sullivan commenced private practice as counsel in Perth. He was briefed as counsel on three occassions on matters which were in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office before his retirement and which had been subject to his general oversight as Deputy Crown Solicitor. The briefing of counsel by solicitors is a common practice in Western Australia although the two branches of the legal profession are formally amalgamated. The Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth has over recent years briefed out to counsel a good deal of work in the superior courts and some work in courts of summary jurisdiction. In deciding whether to brief out a matter to counsel, the Deputy Crown Solicitor will have regard to the views of a client department, the importance of the case, the expertise required and the availability of resources within the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office. Inquiries were made by the Acting Deputy Crown Solicitor in relation to the reasons for Mr O'Sullivan' s selection as counsel in the three cases referred to above. The Acting Deputy Crown Solicitor reported that he understood that Mr O'Sullivan was briefed because of his expertise and understanding of the cases in question.

        —On 12 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1292) Senator Townley asked me a question without notice as to whether it was unlawful in the United States of America for electric utilities to impose on present electricity subscribers the cost of power stations being built, but not yet producing income.

      </para>
      <para>
       No uniform law exists in the United States covering the setting of electricity tariffs. Tariffs are determined by separate State public utility commissions operating under State legislation. Rates for wholesale power and interstate power, however, are determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but these only cover 13 per cent of total electricity sales in the United States.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a consequence, the inclusion in electricity tariffs of a component to fund new capital works, such as power stations, varies from State to State. For example, in Ohio, legislation expressly forbids any charges for new capital works to be added to electricity tariffs, while in Arizona a component of 20 per cent is permitted. I understand that this whole issue is the subject of an ongoing dialogue between the electric utilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Congress.

       My question to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General concerns Mr Al Grassby, the Commissioner for Community Relations, whose seven-year appointment as Commissioner comes to an end on 31 October. What decision has been made about Mr Grassby's future? Given his outstanding record of support for, and championing of the causes of ethnic minorities in this country, given the high standard of the reports that he has presented to this Parliament, and given the very high degree of acceptability which he has in ethnic communities throughout Australia, including Aboriginal communities, will the Government reappoint him?

       The Government is appreciative of Mr Grassby's contribution to racial tolerance in the Australian community during the seven years he occupied the office. The Government believes that the nature of the position is such that after several years there should be a new occupant who can contribute new ideas to the work. Mr J. Long, a former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, has therefore been appointed to the office.

       The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following response to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is well aware of the benefits of remote sensing technology, and in 1980 established the Australian Landsat Station to receive and process Landsat data for private, State Government, Commonwealth and research users.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am aware of moves in the United States to move Landsat operations gradually into the private sector. The first part of this phased move is expected to take place when responsibility for the management of some of the present operational Landsat data passes from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration next year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has access to Landsat data through a Memorandum of Understanding with the United States Government. Moves by that Government towards commercial operation of Landsat, and further cost recovery, will, no doubt, be reflected in future Memoranda. Australia's interests in this area will be carefully examined and protected, as far as possible, with each renewal.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Landsat series of satellites is scheduled to cease operation between 1988 and 1990. I should emphasise that other remote sensing satellites are planned by a variety of countries and agencies, and that we have already begun to examine the possibilities for use of alternative and complementary remote sensing satellites.

       The article in the Australian Financial Review refers to the development of a credit and loan management unit (CALMU) which has been developed by the South Eastern Electricity Board in Britain. Its designers claim that the integrity of the CALMU design is now proven, and it is proposed to manufacture three hundred (300) such units for field trials in the areas supplied by the Midlands Electricity Board, the East Midlands Board and the South Eastern Board. During these trials the CALMUs will be used in series with existing electro- mechanical meters.

      Security of Bass Strait Oil Rigs

        —On 21 October 1982, (Hansard, page 1688) Senator Robert Ray asked me, without notice, whether I was aware that security arrangements for the protection of the Bass Strait petroleum fields were being impaired by the inability of naval patrol vessels to operate in the region in heavy weather conditions and what action is proposed to be taken to rectify this matter.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The following information amplifies my earlier answer:
      </para>
      <para>
       Naval patrol boats are assigned to patrol the waters around the platforms and pipelines and to anticipate and respond to any infringements of restricted areas by surface vessels. In 1981-82, approximately 40 per cent of on-station time was lost as a result of adverse weather conditions. Some improvement in the on-task time is expected following the replacement of the Attack with the fremantle class of vessel. It should also be noted that the producers' helicopters and work boats, which are very much larger than the patrol boats, can provide an all-weather response capacity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The patrols by naval vessels are one element of a comprehensive package of measures that has been introduced, following consultations between relevant Commonwealth and State authorities and the operators, for the protection of the offshore petroleum producing facilities. Those consultations are part of wider and continuing consultation on security matters and contingency arrangements that take place between the Commonwealth and the States through the Standing Advisory Committee on Protection Against Violence, for which my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services has co-ordinating responsibilitity. Other measures adopted for Bass Strait include restrictions on sea and air access to the area in the vicinity of the facilities, surveillance by radar and radio and patrols by Defence Force aircraft. Also, as noted above, the all-weather work boats and helicopters operated by the producers provide additional protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and in accordance with the 1958 Convention of the Continental Shelf, saftey zones have been declared around each platform, prohibiting entry by any unauthorised vessel. Amendments to the Act, now before Parliament, give effect to an Area to be Avoided to which entry is prohibited to unauthorised Australian vessels over 200 tonnes gross tonnage. The Area to be Avoided replaces the existing advisory restricted area established in 1976. Complementary Victorian legislation will be required to implement the Area to be Avoided within the three-mile territorial sea.
      </para>
      <para>
       For foreign vessels, the restrictions have been promulgated as an Area to be Avoided in accordance with arrangements approved by the International Maritime Organisation. They will become mandatory for foreign vessels as their governments pass appropriate legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       All-weather surveillance of the Area to be Avoided and nearby waters in maintained using radar mounted on one of the outer platforms. The unit can detect ships up to 32 kilometres distant and is operational 24 hours each day. Fixed radar on offshore installations is the most practical and efficient means of providing surveillance on a full time, all-weather basis and studies are currently being undertaken with a view to upgrading the platform based radar system utilising the latest technology available.
      </para>
      <para>
       The present radar facility is supplemented by open radio links and support from Defence Force patrols. In addition to patrols undertaken by Navy surface craft, daily patrols are made by Tracker aircraft. Regular aerial patrols of the Australian Fishing Zone, which includes Bass Strait, are made through the area by RAAF P 3 Orion aircraft. When necessary these patrols can be supplemented by the producers' work boats and helicopters.
      </para>
      <para>
       The package of measures that has been developed is considered adequate in the current circumstances in the Bass Strait petroleum producing fields. the package will be enhanced by the passage of the measures contained in the amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act now before the Parliament and by proposed upgrading of radar facilities. The effectiveness of the measures for the protection of the petroleum producing facilities is subjected to continuing review and, if additional measures are considered desirable, the Commonwealth will take steps to ensure they are introduced.
